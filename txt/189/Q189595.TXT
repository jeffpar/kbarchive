Information on Installation
---------------------------

Microsoft has made improvements to the native Virtual Private Networking (VPN)
capabilities of Windows client and server that significantly improve the
performance and security PPTP-based VPN connections via the Internet for Windows
NT Server and Windows NT Workstation version 4.0.

This upgrade should be applied to both Windows NT Servers and Windows NT
Workstations version 4.0. Service Pack 3 for Windows NT 4.0 must also be
installed before applying this update.

   Please note: Windows NT Servers running Routing and Remote Access Service
   (RRAS) must first apply this Windows NT PPTP performance upgrade followed by
   the RRAS Hotfix 3.0 to benefit from the upgrade (it is important not to
   reboot your machine in-between installations of the NT PPTP upgrade & the
   Routing and Remote Access Service upgrade).

For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

   ARTICLE-ID: Q189594
   TITLE : RRAS Upgrade for WinNT Server 4.0 Hotfix Pack 3.0 Release Notes

This upgrade is packaged in an auto-install format. It is recommended that you
first copy the upgrade to a temporary directory, and then double-click the
executable name or type the executable name "pptpfixi.exe" for x86 or
"pptpfixa.exe" (without the quotation marks) for alpha at a command prompt to
install.

The files can also be extracted from the Upgrade pack without installing them. To
do this, copy the Upgrade to a temporary directory, and type "pptpfixi /x" or
"pptpfixa /x" (without the quotation marks) at a command prompt. After
extracting the files, the Upgrade can be installed by typing "hotfix" (without
the quotation marks) at a command prompt.

To uninstall this upgrade, extract the files to a directory using the "/x"
command as mentioned above and then type "HOTFIX -Y" (without the quotation
marks) from the same directory you copied the files to.

Output of "HOTFIX -?" :

HOTFIX [-y] [-f] [-n] [-z] [-q] [-m] [-l]

      -y Perform uninstall (only with -m or -q)
      -f Force apps closed at shutdown
      -n Do not create uninstall directory
      -z Do not reboot when update completes
      -q Quiet Mode -- no user interface
      -m Unattended mode
      -l List installed hotfixes

Security Features in this Upgrade
---------------------------------

This upgrade provides several RAS/PPTP security enhancements for Microsoft
Windows NT 4.0. This upgrade also includes the performance improvements and
other fixes that were included in previously released PPTP hotfixes for Windows
NT Service Pack 3.

 - A new version of MSCHAP (MSCHAP V2) has been implemented for VPN connections.
   This new protocol provides mutual authentication, stronger initial data
   encryption keys, and different encryption keys for the transmit and receive
   paths. To minimize the risk of password compromise during MSCHAP exchanges,
   MSCHAP V2 drops support for the MSCHAP password change V1, and will not
   transmit the LMHash encoding of the password.

   For VPN connection requests, a Windows NT server will offer MSCHAP V2 before
   offering the legacy MSCHAP. Updated Windows clients (all platforms) will
   accept MSCHAP V2 when it is offered. This behavior affects only VPN
   connections; dial-up connections are not affected.

 - A new registry key, SecureVPN, has been defined to force use of MSCHAP V2.
   When this variable is absent it has a default value of zero. When set to one
   on a Windows NT server, this registry key causes the server to drop any VPN
   connections that do not authenticate using MSCHAP V2. This will prevent
   legacy VPN clients from presenting their credentials in an MSCHAP (or CHAP or
   PAP) exchange, and is a likely configuration for networks that require a more
   secure authentication method for VPN connections.

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\RasMan\PPP

   DWORD: SecureVPN
   Value: 0x00000001 == force MSCHAP V2 for VPN connections
   Value: 0x00000000 == do not force secure MSCHAP V2 (default)

   When set to one on a Windows NT 4.0 client, the SecureVPN registry key forces
   the client to use MSCHAP V2 for all VPN (PPTP) connections. Dial-up
   connections are not affected by this registry setting.

   Please note: Most users will not need to use the Secure VPN flag. This flag
   should be used with care because it will affect the behavior of all VPN
   connections from a client. In general, the required use of MSCHAP V2 can be
   enforced more easily on the server.

 - This release also provides a registry variable, UseLmPassword, which can be
   set to prevent clients from sending the LM response to a legacy MSCHAP
   challenge or in an MSCHAP change password exchange. When this variable is
   absent it has a default value of one, allowing use of the LM response (in
   order to maintain compatibility with legacy systems).

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\RasMan\PPP\Chap

   DWORD: UseLmPassword
   Value: 0x00000001 == send LMHash of the password (default)
   Value: 0x00000000 == do not send LMHash of the password

   Setting this variable to zero on a server will cause the server to drop any
   connection request which uses the LM response in an MSCHAP exchange. Setting
   this variable to zero on a client will prevent the client from using LM
   responses in MSCHAP exchanges. This variable affects BOTH dial-up and VPN
   connections.

   Please note: Most users will not need to use this registry variable. The new
   secure mode MSCHAP V2 will not send the LMHash response, so this registry
   value is most useful when connecting to older access servers which use the
   original MSCHAP.

Fixes and Features included from the 2.0 Hotfix
-----------------------------------------------

PPTP Performance Issues Addressed in this Update:

 - A new historyless mode for encryption & compression over PPTP connections
   has been enabled. This new mode will dramatically improve performance using
   PPTP in high latency networks, or networks that commonly experience
   significant packet loss like the Internet. This upgrade is fully compatible
   with legacy PPTP systems. However, in order to negotiate historyless mode,
   both the PPTP client and server must support the upgrade. If either client or
   server refuses the new mode, normal MPPE compression and encryption will be
   negotiated to insure communication capabilities are not lost. To experience
   the full benefit of the PPTP performance update, this update must be
   installed on both Windows NT clients and servers. A corresponding release
   Microsoft Dial-Up Networking 1.3 is available for Windows 95 clients, while
   the new release of Windows 98 already includes the appropriate client code.

   Please note: RAS Servers that terminate compulsory PPTP connections from an
   FEP (Front End Processor) must disable historyless compression/encryption in
   order for legacy Windows 95 clients to receive data properly. An FEP is a
   dial-up server which can create a PPTP tunnel on behalf of its dial-up
   clients. This feature is available from several Access Server vendors,
   including Compaq (Microcom), Ascend, and 3com.

   The value to set in the registry to enable/disable historyless
   encryption/compression is:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NdisWan\Parameters

   DWORD: Historyless
   Value: 0x00000001 == Enabled (default)
   Value: 0x00000000 == Disabled

 - The default PPTP receive window size was increased to 16.

 - The window between the NDISWAN driver and the PPTP driver was increased.

 - The PPTP frame size has been set to default to 1400 bytes to avoid packet
   fragmentation.

   Please note: The frame size issue was also addressed in an earlier hotfix, and
   is documented at:

   http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q162/2/30.asp

Remote Access Service and PPTP Issues:

 - PPTP server responsiveness has been improved for the time period right after
   termination of multiple PPTP connections.

 - A PPTP server issue of an improperly configured packet header "start session"
   has been corrected. This issue is documented at:

   http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q179/1/07.asp

 - Improved integrity of session encryption in MPPE by increasing the randomness
   of successive packet key management following an encryption or compression
   reset.

 - Corrected a RAS/PPTP user interface design issue that could mislead an
   administrator regarding the actual configuration of the server. This issue is
   documented at:

   http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q177/6/70.asp

 - Updated MSCHAP to disable sending the LMHash when client set to "require"
   128-bit encryption.

Other Windows NT Issues Addressed in this Update:

 - This release includes an enhancement to TCP/IP which will improve the
   performance of TCP-based applications over high latency networks, such as the
   Internet.
