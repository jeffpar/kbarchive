The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation, Pan Chinese Edition, version 4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Q. What is Pan Chinese Windows NT Workstation version 4.0?

   A. In the Hong Kong environment, the mixed use of Simplified and Traditional
   Characters is demanding. Because of this, Microsoft introduced the Microsoft
   Pan Chinese Windows NT operating system. This operating system combines
   Traditional and Simplified Chinese Windows NT Workstation features and the
   core elements are based on the Simplified Chinese version of Windows NT
   Workstation 4.0. Most of the interface is in English. You can create
   documents with Traditional and Simplified Chinese Characters by using GBK and
   Unicode code pages. Traditional Chinese BIG5 Characters are also supported by
   switching locales.

2. Q. What does locale mean?

   A. Locales are simply user preference information that is related to the
   user's language and sub-language, represented as a list of values. For
   example, Chinese (PRC), Chinese (Taiwan), and Chinese (Hong Kong) locale. At
   a very high level, Windows Natural Language Support (WinNLS) incorporates
   several disparate definitions of a locale into one coherent model. Like
   Windows NT, WinNLS has been designed to be general enough at a low level to
   support multiple distinct high-level functions.

3. Q. Which code page supports which locale?

   A. Chinese (PRC, Hong Kong, and Singapore) locales are supported using GBK and
   Unicode code pages. The Chinese (Taiwan) locale is supported using BIG5 and
   Unicode code pages.

4. Q. What are the system requirements for Pan Chinese Windows NT?

   A. System requirements for Intel and compatible systems:*

   - 486/25 MHz processor (or Pentium) - 16 MB of RAM (24 MB recommended) -
   CD-ROM drive or access to a CD-ROM drive over a computer network - 210 MB of

   Microsoft Mouse or compatible pointing device

   System requirements for RISC-based systems:*

   - Workstation with Alpha AXP, MIPS R4x00 (or PowerPC processor) - 24 MB of
   memory - CD-ROM drive or access to a CD-ROM drive over a computer network -
   210 MB of available hard disk space - VGA or higher resolution display

5. Q. How do I know if my computer is capable of running Pan Chinese Windows
   NT?

   A. The minimum system requirements for Pan Chinese Windows NT are a 486/25 MHz
   processor, 12 MB of RAM and at least 210 MB of available hard disk space. The
   recommended system requirements for Pan Chinese Windows NT are a Pentium
   processor, 16 MB or more of RAM, and at least 210 MB of available hard disk
   space.

6. Q. Can I automatically upgrade from MS-DOS 6.x, Windows 3.x, Windows 95, or
   Windows NT to Pan Chinese Windows NT?

   A. No. Pan Chinese Windows NT will be available in full version only. Due to
   the differences in registry architectures, there is no automated upgrade to
   Pan Chinese Windows NT. Those systems that are manually migrated from MS-DOS
   6.x, Windows 3.x, Windows 95, or Windows NT to Pan Chinese Windows NT will
   need to have their applications reinstalled.

7. Q. Can Windows 95 and Pan Chinese Windows NT co-exist on the same computer?

   A. Yes. You cannot upgrade your Windows 95 installation to Pan Chinese Windows
   NT, but you can install Pan Chinese Windows NT to a different folder.

8. Q. Does Pan Chinese Windows NT Workstation 4.0 run Windows 95 compatible
   applications?

   A. Although the vast majority of the applications written for Windows 95 will
   run on Windows NT Workstation 4.0, the feature differences between Windows NT
   Workstation 4.0 and Windows 95 do not yet allow 100 percent compatibility of
   applications between the platforms.

9. Q. What is the difference between English/Chinese Windows NT Workstation 4.0
   and Pan Chinese Windows NT Workstation 4.0?

   A. Pan Chinese Windows NT provides an English user interface like the U.S.
   version of Windows NT 4.0 and allows typing of Traditional and Simplified
   Chinese Characters in a document using Unicode or GBK applications. In
   addition, BIG5 applications are also support for entering Traditional Chinese
   Characters.

10. Q. What is new in PAN Chinese Windows NT?

   A. It includes the following full features of Simplified Chinese Windows NT
   4.0:

   - Chinese GBK code page support (including GB and BIG5 glyphs) - IMEs (PRC
   New Intelligent and Taiwan Chajie) - Chinese GBK fonts (SongTi, HeiTi) -
   Chinese Code Converter between GB/GBK/BIG5/Unicode, Traditional and
   Simplified Chinese characters (text file only)

11. Q. What input methods are included in Pan Chinese Windows NT Workstation
   version 4.0?

   A. Taiwan Chajie, Cantonese, Zheng Ma and PRC New Intelligent (MS PingYing -
   Simplified Chinese Characters only).
