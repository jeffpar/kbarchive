======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a package is distributed from one site to another, and the sites are in
different time zones, the time stamp on the package's source files may be
changed.

For example, assume that you have a package source file with a time of 8:30 P.M.
on a Systems Management Server (SMS) site in the U.S. Eastern time zone (GMT
-5:00). In Windows Explorer, the file shows a time stamp of 8:30 P.M when you
view the file locally. After the package that contains this file is distributed
to a site in the U.S. Pacific time zone (GMT -8:00), the file also shows an 8:30
P.M. time stamp when it is viewed locally at the destination site. However, the
file should show a time stamp of 5:30 P.M. when it is viewed locally. If you
view the same file remotely from the originating site, it shows a time stamp of
11:30 P.M.

Other than the time-stamp difference, there is no difference between the files at
the originating site and the files at the destination site.

CAUSE
=====

The compressed package file that is used to transmit the package source files
from one site to another does not store the time-zone information for the
originating site. When the package file is decompressed at the destination site,
the source files are stored with the same date and time as on the originating
site. There is no compensation for the time-zone differences.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

   http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The post-Service Pack 3 version of this fix should have the following file
attributes or later:

   Date        Time   Version         Size     File name     Platform
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   1-Mar-2001  19:25  2.00.1493.3253  811,792  Baseutil.dll  Alpha
   1-Mar-2001  19:25  2.00.1493.3253  527,296  Baseutil.dll  I386

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that
contains the above files may also contain additional files.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
the Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4 Hotfix Rollup Package (HRP).

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine if the problem that is described in this article has occurred, use
one computer to view the details of the files in a package. Use one instance of
Windows Explorer to view the files at the originating site, and use another
instance of Windows Explorer to view the files at the destination site's
distribution point. If the package's source files show a difference in time (a
difference of hours for most time zones), the package source files at the
destination site have been affected by this problem.

Hotfix Installation Instructions
--------------------------------

Apply the fix to all of the sites in the SMS hierarchy. After you apply the
hotfix, the date and time stamps are handled correctly for any new package, or
any package that you redistribute. To correct existing packages, use the Manage
Distribution Points Wizard. In SMS Administrator, right-click a package, and
then use the "Update all distribution points with a new package source version"
option.

How to Use the Hotfix Installer:

NOTE: You can use this method only on Intel-based computers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a share on your network. Note that
   Q319427.exe is a Microsoft SMS Installer file that updates specific files on
   your site server.

2. Log on to the site server by using an account with administrator permissions.

3. On the site server, quit the SMS Administrator console.

4. Run the Q319427.exe tool and then follow the instructions in the wizard. You
   can run the file in Quiet mode by using the /s switch.

How to Manually Install the Hotfix:

1. On the site server, quit the SMS Administrator console.

2. Stop the SMS Site Component Manager, SMS Executive, Windows Management, and
   SMS SQL Monitor services on the site server.

3. Replace the Baseutil.dll file in the
   <Sms_root_folder>\Bin\<Platform> folder with the version of the
   file from the hotfix.

4. Restart the SMS Site Component Manager, SMS Executive, Windows Management,
   and SMS SQL Monitor services.
