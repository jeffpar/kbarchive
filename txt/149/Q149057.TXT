SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses some advanced topics regarding RDO Dynamic cursors that
are not explained in the Visual Basic documentation. Use it as a supplement to
Understanding Cursors and Choosing a Cursor Type found in the Visual Basic
online Help by doing an indexed find on the keyword Cursors.

Use the Visual Basic online Help and the Building Client/Server Applications
guide to get more general information on the different types of RDO cursors.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Dynamic cursors have no fixed membership of rows. As you move from one rowset to
another (number of rows in a rowset is determined by the RowsetSize property),
the driver may return any set of rows. This new rowset might include new rows
added to the table that happen to match the where clause, but it's hard to know
where the new rows will actually show up (maybe at the end).

RDO only goes back to the server when it needs another rowset of data (again,
number of rows in a rowset is determined by the RowsetSize property), so changes
by other users won't show up until the rowset boundary is crossed. Adjusting the
RowsetSize property is done to balance performance against freshness of data.
Because frequent trips to the server are very expensive, it is not advisable, in
a client/server environment where a network is involved, to ping back to the
server every time you move to a new row - the Jet database engine does this and
it is not as fast as RDO across the network.

Bookmarks are not supported in Dynamic cursors - the Bookmarkable property will
always be false for a dynamic cursor. The SQL Server driver doesn't give
bookmarks in dynamic cursors because there is no immutable row id in SQL Server.
Bookmarks work within rowsets but not across them, so the Bookmarkable property
is set to false.

SQL Server cannot be implemented like an ISAM database. The design goal is to
make a client/server system scalable. RDO allows you to refresh data constantly
by setting the RowsetSize = 1, but this results in network round- trips (by
definition) every time you move, and hinder you on a slower network or when many
users are on the system. This is not an efficient way to implement client/server
programming, and no DBMS or development tool can address the fact that network
round-trip's takes time. RDO uses ODBC without introducing any magic on top,
which is why it is both fast and small.

Sample Program
--------------

This example describes how to set up a dynamic rdoResultset. It uses a DSN-less
ODBC connection so it is not necessary to set up a DSN with the ODBC Admin
utility.

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default. Add a
   CommandButton to Form1.

2. Paste the following code into the General Declarations section of Form1.

         Private Sub Command1_Click()
           Dim en As rdoEnvironment
           Dim cn As rdoConnection
           Dim rs As rdoResultset
           Dim sql As String

           'establish connection
           Set en = rdoEngine.rdoEnvironments(0)
           en.CursorDriver = rdUseIfNeeded
           'this should be modified to connect to your database
           Dim cnStr As String

           cnStr = "driver={SQL Server};server=myserver;" & _
             "database=pubs;uid=myuid;pwd=mypwd"
           Set cn = en.OpenConnection(dsName:="", Prompt:=rdDriverNoPrompt, _
             ReadOnly:=False, Connect:=cnStr)

           'create an SQL statement that matches a table in your database
           sql = "Select * From Titles"
           'the next line opens a Dynamic resultset
           Set rs = cn.OpenResultset(Name:=sql, Type:=rdOpenDynamic, _
             LockType:=rdConcurRowver, Option:=rdAsyncEnable)
           While rs.StillExecuting
             DoEvents
           Wend
           'prints first 3 columns of the first row
           Me.Print rs(0), rs(1), rs(2)
         End Sub

3. Change your DRIVER, SERVER, DATABASE, UID, and PWD in the OpenConnection
   method. Modify the SQL statement contained in the Command1_Click event to
   match your SQL data source.

4. Start the program or press the F5 key. Click on the Command1 button to start
   the query, which will display the first 3 columns of the first row on the
   form.
