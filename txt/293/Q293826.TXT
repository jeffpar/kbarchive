-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
 - Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A denial of service (DoS) vulnerability exists in Microsoft Internet Information
Services (IIS) 5.0 and Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0 because
the function that processes wildcard sequences in FTP commands does not always
allocate sufficient memory when it performs pattern matching. Under unusual
circumstances, it may be possible for an attacker to levy an FTP command
containing a wildcard sequence that, when expanded, can overrun the allocated
memory and cause an access violation.

This scenario can cause the IIS service (which provides both Web and FTP
functionality) to fail. As a result, all Web or FTP sessions that are in
progress at the time are severed, and no new sessions can be established until
the IIS service is restarted. In IIS 5.0, the service restarts automatically. In
IIS 4.0, operator intervention is required to restart the service.

The attacker cannot add, change, or delete data on the server through this
vulnerability, nor can the attacker usurp any administrative privileges.

Mitigating Factor

The attacker must be able to start an FTP session in order to exploit the
vulnerability.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because of a flaw in a pattern-matching function that is
used by at least one FTP command. Depending on the wildcard sequence that is
entered and the specific configuration of the server's file system, it is
possible for the resulting pattern to exceed the available memory and trigger an
access violation. This, in turn, causes the IIS service to fail.
