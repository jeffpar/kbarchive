Code  Name                                  Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1300L ERROR_NOT_ALL_ASSIGNED                Indicates not all privileges
                                            referenced are assigned to the
                                            caller. This allows, for
                                            example, all privileges to be
                                            disabled without having to
                                            know exactly which privileges
                                            are assigned.
1301L ERROR_SOME_NOT_MAPPED                 Some of the information to be
                                            mapped has not been
                                            translated.
1302L ERROR_NO_QUOTAS_FOR_ACCOUNT           No system quota limits are
                                            specifically set for this
                                            account.
1303L ERROR_LOCAL_USER_SESSION_KEY          A user session key was
                                            requested for a local RPC
                                            connection. The session key
                                            returned is a constant value
                                            and not unique to this
                                            connection.
1304L ERROR_NULL_LM_PASSWORD                The Windows NT password is too
                                            complex to be converted to a
                                            Windows-networking password.
                                            The Windows-networking
                                            password returned is a NULL
                                            string.
1305L ERROR_UNKNOWN_REVISION                Indicates an encountered or

                                            not one known by the service.
                                            The service may not be aware
                                            of a more recent revision.
1306L ERROR_REVISION_MISMATCH               Indicates two revision levels
                                            are incompatible.
1307L ERROR_INVALID_OWNER                   Indicates a particular
                                            Security ID cannot be assigned
                                            as the owner of an object.
1308L ERROR_INVALID_PRIMARY_GROUP           Indicates a particular
                                            Security ID cannot be assigned
                                            as the primary group of an
                                            object.
1309L ERROR_NO_IMPERSONATION_TOKEN          An attempt was made to operate

                                            disabled.
1311L ERROR_NO_LOGON_SERVERS                There are currently no logon
                                            servers available to service
                                            the logon request.
1312L ERROR_NO_SUCH_LOGON_SESSION           A specified logon session does
                                            not exist. It may already have
                                            been terminated.
1313L ERROR_NO_SUCH_PRIVILEGE               A specified privilege does not
                                            exist.

                                            account. Also used to indicate
                                            a group can not be deleted
                                            because it contains a member.
1321L ERROR_MEMBER_NOT_IN_GROUP             The specified user account is
                                            not a member of the specified
                                            group account.
1322L ERROR_LAST_ADMIN                      Indicates the requested
                                            operation would disable or
                                            delete the last remaining
                                            administration account. This
                                            is not allowed to prevent
                                            creating a situation where the
                                            system will not be
                                            administrable.

                                            password, this return status
                                            indicates the value provided
                                            as the current password is
                                            incorrect.
1324L ERROR_ILL_FORMED_PASSWORD             When trying to update a
                                            password, this return status
                                            indicates the value provided
                                            for the new password contains
                                            values not allowed in
                                            passwords.
1325L ERROR_PASSWORD_RESTRICTION            When trying to update a
                                            password, this status
                                            indicates that some password
                                            update rule was violated. For
                                            example, the password may not
                                            meet length criteria.
1326L ERROR_LOGON_FAILURE                   The attempted logon is
                                            invalid. This is due to either
                                            a bad user name or
                                            authentication information.
1327L ERROR_ACCOUNT_RESTRICTION             Indicates a referenced user

                                            information are valid, but

                                            authentication (such as time-
                                            of-day restrictions).
1328L ERROR_INVALID_LOGON_HOURS             The user account has time

                                            logged onto at this time.
1329L ERROR_INVALID_WORKSTATION             The user account is restricted
                                            and cannot be used to log on
                                            from the source workstation.

                                            currently disabled and cannot
                                            be logged on to.
1332L ERROR_NONE_MAPPED                     None of the information to be
                                            mapped has been translated.
1333L ERROR_TOO_MANY_LUIDS_REQUESTED        The number of LUID requested
                                            cannot be allocated with a
                                            single allocation.
1334L ERROR_LUIDS_EXHAUSTED                 Indicates there are no more
                                            LUID to allocate.
1335L ERROR_INVALID_SUB_AUTHORITY           Indicates the sub-authority
                                            value is invalid for the
                                            particular use.
1336L ERROR_INVALID_ACL                     Indicates the ACL structure is
                                            not valid.
1337L ERROR_INVALID_SID                     Indicates the SID structure is

1338L ERROR_INVALID_SECURITY_DESCR          Indicates the

                                            is invalid.
1340L ERROR_BAD_INHERITANCE_ACL             Indicates that an attempt to
                                            build either an inherited ACL
                                            or ACE did not succeed. One of
                                            the more probable causes is
                                            the replacement of a CreatorId
                                            with an SID that didn't fit
                                            into the ACE or ACL.
1341L ERROR_SERVER_DISABLED                 The GUID allocation server is

1344L ERROR_ALLOTTED_SPACE_EXCEEDED         When a block of memory is

                                            Since quota may already have
                                            been charged to several

                                            Instead, a request that
                                            requires more memory than has
                                            been allotted must fail and
