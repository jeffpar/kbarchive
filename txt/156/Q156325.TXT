KEYWORDS:kb3rdparty kbprint kbPrinting

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use the Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskScan software version 2.3
in Windows NT version 4.0, you may receive the following error message:

   STOP: 0x0000001E - aspi32.sys
   Unhandled kernel exception

CAUSE
=====

HP DeskScan version 2.3.x does not function properly in Windows NT version 4.0.
This is because DeskScan 2.3.x uses an ASPI driver to control an HP ScanJet
scanner. DeskScan 2.2 does not rely on an ASPI driver and functions properly
under both Windows NT 3.5x and Windows NT 4.0.

NOTE: The Aspi32.sys driver included with DeskScan 2.3.x will work properly only
under Windows NT 3.51.

RESOLUTION
==========

Using DeskScan 2.2 - does not require an ASPI driver
----------------------------------------------------

To use HP DeskScan software on Windows NT version 4.0, obtain version 2.2 of the
software from HP's web site. DeskScan 2.2 requires that a directory called
"Disk1" be created first and then the self-extracting file should be executed
from within this directory. Then follow the installation instructions in both
the Readme.nt and Readme.wri files that appear in the Disk1 directory.

-OR-

Using DeskScan 2.3.x - requires an ASPI driver
----------------------------------------------

To use HP DeskScan software on Windows NT version 4.0, obtain version 2.3.x of
the software from HP's web site and follow the installation instructions in both
the Readme.nt and Readme.wri files that appear in the Disk1 directory when the
self- extracting file is run. Also, it is important that an updated Aspi32.sys
driver be obtained for the SCSI controller used with your system if this
software is intended to be used with Windows NT version 4.0. The Aspi32.sys
included with DeskScan 2.3.x will only work with Windows NT 3.51.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have an Adaptec SCSI controller, you can contact Adaptec for an updated
Aspi32.sys driver. For all other SCSI controllers, including the HP supplied
SCSI controllers, contact your SCSI controller manufacturer or Adaptec for
information on obtaining an updated Aspi32.sys driver. For information about how
