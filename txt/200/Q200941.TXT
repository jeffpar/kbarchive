   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

The "Restore in Progress" system registry key is critical to successful
restoration of an Exchange Server online backup. This article discusses the
following topics:

 - The general functionality of the registry key.

 - The relationship of the patch (.pat) files to the registry key.

 - How to safely remove this registry key, when necessary.

 - How to create this registry key manually, when necessary.

 - How to interpret error messages that you may receive when the database starts
   after you restore an online backup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you restore a database from an online backup, its startup sequence is
different from ordinary database startup in the following three critical ways:

 - The process is controlled by values in the "Restore in Progress" registry
   key. The checkpoint file (Edb.chk) is completely ignored. In essence, the
   LowLog Number value in the registry key acts as the checkpoint.

 - At least one log file must be played into the database. Database files that
   are restored from an online backup are always inconsistent. Log files that
   are required to make the database file consistent again are saved to tape
   with the database, and must be replayed into the database after restoration,
   so there is always at least one log file on every Exchange Server online
   backup tape. The "Restore in Progress" registry key lists the range of log
   files restored from tape.

 - Information in the patch files (*.pat) must be applied to the database along
   with information from the restored log files. Patch information is only
   applied to the database if the "Restore in Progress" registry key exists.

The following is the path to the "Restore in Progress" registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeDS or
   MSExchangeIS\Restore in Progress

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

Consistent vs. Inconsistent Databases Files
-------------------------------------------

An Exchange Server database file is considered inconsistent if there are any
transactions present in the log files that have not yet been written to the
database file. This means a database file is always inconsistent during normal
operation. Because an online backup occurs without interrupting normal
operation, the database saved to tape is necessarily inconsistent.

During a normal shutdown, the database file is made consistent before the service
stops; all of the information from the log files is applied to the database
file. Consequently, when you next start the database, there is no log
information that needs to be replayed during startup. If the database is
unexpectedly stopped, the database file is inconsistent, and "soft recovery"
automatically runs during the next startup, to apply outstanding log
transactions to the database file before it restarts.

The checkpoint file (Edb.chk) has the following two roles:

 - The checkpoint file keeps track of which logged transactions have been
   written to the database file. In normal operation, the checkpoint may lag
   behind by several logs.

 - The checkpoint file provides the information that the online backup process
   needs to determine which logs should be put on tape and which logs may be
   safely purged from the disk after the backup is complete.

If the checkpoint file is unavailable after a database has been shut down in an
inconsistent state, the database scans all of the available log files when it
restarts to determine whether the log file data has or has not been written to
the database file. Exchange Server can reliably determine which transactions
have already been applied. If the checkpoint file is lost in this situation,
startup merely takes more time.

IMPORTANT: If you manually remove the checkpoint file and remove some log files,
you may damage the database if it has been shut down in an inconsistent state.
Exchange Server needs to apply all of the outstanding log transactions when it
restarts. If only a subset of the outstanding log transactions is found, the
subset is applied but is not sufficient to retain the integrity of the
database.

Never remove log files that have not been applied to the database file.

Base:

   Q240145 XADM: How to Tell Which Transaction Log Files Can Be Safely Removed

During normal operation, the transaction logs completely describe all changes
made to the database file. As the database is put on tape, changes may be made
to the database that affect parts of the file already locked up on tape. Not all
such changes can be captured in the log files. These changes are therefore
placed in the patch files.

A patch file contains "snapshots" of specific pages in the database file. As
transaction logs are replayed into a restored database file, Exchange checks to
see if a page described in a log file also exists in the patch file. If it does,
the version from the patch file is used. This process is called "hard recovery"
(as opposed to the soft recovery described above).

Hard Recovery and the Restore in Progress Registry Key
------------------------------------------------------

After a restored database has completed recovery successfully, the "Restore in
Progress" registry key is automatically deleted. But if a startup does not work,
the key remains in the registry. You may occasionally need to manually delete
the key after you troubleshoot and resolve the cause of a startup problem. It is
critical that you do not delete the registry key before all of the patch file
data has been applied to the database file.

If you delete the "Restore in Progress" registry key and the Edb.chk file, a soft
recovery is run against a restored database, which scans and applies all of the
available logs, but without the patch file information.

Therefore, if you remove the "Restore in Progress" registry key, your database is
guaranteed to be corrupted unless at least one of the following conditions is
met:

 - The patch file that matches the database is empty.

 - All of the log files that are restored from the full online backup tape have
   already been replayed into the database.

An "empty" patch file is 8 kilobytes (KB) in size (it has two 4 KB header pages,
just like a database file). If you do not play the patch file into your
database, then for every extra 4 KB in the patch file, there is one corrupted
page in your database.

You only need patch file data to replay logs that come from a full backup tape.
You do not need the patch file to replay additional log files from incremental
backups or additional log files that existed on disk before restoration. If the
startup process stops working at a point after all of the logs from the full
backup have been played and you delete the "Restore in Progress" registry key,
you do not cause any damage from missed patch file data.

However, it is not always safe to delete the "Restore in Progress" registry key
after events are logged in the application event log that indicate the
successful replay of all of the logs from the tape. The key also remaps and
controls log file paths during replay, and if the paths have changed between the
time that the backup was taken and the time that it was restored, when you
delete the key you may still cause other problems, or you may be unable to
replay all of the data from all of the logs.

Nonetheless, as a rule of thumb, if the Exchange Server system configuration and
paths have not been altered after the backup was taken, it is usually safe to
delete the "Restore in Progress" registry key if you are certain that the
information from the patch files is no longer needed.

How to Tell If Hard Recovery Has Finished
-----------------------------------------

You can determine if all of the log replay that requires the patch files is
complete by performing the following steps:

1. To view the header of the .pat file that corresponds to the database to
   determine the range of log files that were restored from the full backup
   tape, run the following command

   ESEUTIL /MH <patch_file>

   where <patch_file> is the file name of the patch file, for example:

   ESEUTIL /MH PRIV.PAT

   NOTE: For Exchange Server 4.0 and Exchange Server 5.0, use the EDBUTIL command
   instead of the ESEUTIL command. Part of the output is similar to the
   following:

   

   Current Full Backup:
        Log Gen: - 36-3f
           Mark: (58,1409,199)
           Mark: 8/19/1999 19:47:2

   The Log Gen line under the Current Full Backup section tells you which log
   files come from the full backup tape. In this case, log files Edb00036.log
   through Edb0003f.log are from the backup.

2. Open the Windows NT Event Viewer to determine if all of the logs in this
   range have already been replayed without generating any errors. All of the
   versions of Exchange Server generate replay events that contain text in their
   descriptions similar to the following text:

   The database engine is replaying log file E:\Exchsrvr\Mdbdata\Edbxxxxx.log.

   Make sure that a similar event has been generated for every log from the full
   backup tape.

Even if all of the logs from the tape have been replayed, only delete the
"Restore in Progress" registry key as a last resort. Troubleshoot to determine
the cause of the startup problem first. If you decide to delete the "Restore in
Progress" registry key, save a copy of it by using the Regedit.exe program
Export Registry File option.

Restore in Progress Registry Key Values
---------------------------------------

Every time that Exchange Server starts, it checks for the existence of a "Restore
in Progress" registry key. If one is found, a hard recovery is performed on the
database. If the key exists, but the appropriate files for hard recovery (the
.pat files and all of the logs from tape) are not available, Exchange Server
startup does not work.

After you restore a full online backup, there is always a .pat file in the
current transaction log folder for each database file that was restored. There
is also at least one numbered log file from the tape. (The Edb.log file is never
put on tape; if the Edb.log file exists after a restoration from online backup,
then it was present on the disk before the backup was restored.)

If you understand the "Restore in Progress" registry key, you better understand
the recovery process. Also, if you know what values the key should contain, when
a malformed or incomplete key exists you can detect the problem.

The following are the values in the "Restore in Progress" registry key:

 - LowLogNumber. This value defines the first log file that must be replayed for
   a hard recovery to succeed. If you change this number, a hard recovery does
   not work.

 - HighLog Number. This value is the highest numbered log file that was restored
   from the tape. If multiple backups are restored (a full backup plus a number
   of incremental backups), the HighLog value varies depending on the order of
   restoration.

   In general, restore backups in chronological order, so that the HighLog value
   accurately reflects all of the logs from the tape. This is not a critical
   requirement; it is only essential that the HighLog reflect at least the
   highest numbered log from the full backup tape.

   But if there is a problem in the log files, Exchange Server does treat logs
   that are restored from tape differently than logs that are assumed to have
   already existed on disk. Event Viewer may have more informative
   recommendations about what to do to resolve a problem. In some cases, logs
   that are assumed to have already been on disk and that could be dangerous if
   replayed may be deleted without warning.

 - EDB_RstMap. This multi-valued string defines "before" and "after" universal
   naming convention (UNC) paths for the database files. Odd lines in the string
   are "before" and even lines are "after." Normally, Exchange Server cannot
   replay log files into a database that has been moved from its original path
   location. This value maps an old path to a new path, which makes replay
   possible even if the database is now on a server or drive that is different
   from the drive that it was backed up on. If the "Restore in Progress"
   registry key is malformed, this value is the most likely to have a problem.
   If the before and after strings do not match, exercise extreme caution before
   you delete the "Restore in Progress" registry key, because if you delete this
   key, it may be impossible to replay enough data to make the database
   consistent or startable.

 - EDB_RstMap Size. This value corresponds to the number of databases that are
   attached to a service. The value is either 1 or 2. For the directory service,
   or a server that is dedicated for private folders only or public folders
   only, the value is 1. For an information store that has both private and
   public databases, the value is 2. This value multiplied by 2 is the number of
   lines in the EDB_RstMap value.

 - LogPath. This value is a UNC path that points to the current Transaction Logs
   folder for the server.

 - BackupLogPath. This value is a UNC path that points to the current
   Transaction Logs folder for the server. The BackupLogPath value does not
   point to the "before" log path location, because the original log path
   location is not critical; only the database path location is.

 - CheckpointFilePath. This value is a UNC path that points to the current
   Working Path folder.

 - "EDB Database recovered". Immediately after database restoration, this value
   is 00. After Exchange Server has successfully replayed all of the logs
   (whether the logs were restored from tape or already existed on disk) and
   started the database, this value is changed to 01. Then the database
   automatically shuts down and starts again. When the 01 value is encountered
   during startup, the service deletes the key, instead of obeying it. If you
   change this value to 01 manually, it has the same practical effect as
   deleting the "Restore in Progress" registry key. If this value is 01, it is
   safe to delete the "Restore in Progress" registry key.

How to Re-Create a Restore in Progress Key
------------------------------------------

Save a copy of the "Restore in Progress" registry key before you delete it,
instead of attempting to re-create it. Only use the instructions in this section
as a last resort. If you make a single typographical error or any other error
when you create the key, the restoration does not work.

It is much easier to regenerate a "Restore in Progress" registry key if you have
a template to work from. The next time that you have access to this registry
key, save it permanently from the Regedit.exe program before you start the
database. You can then simply merge the key into the registry and modify
specific values.

To create a valid "Restore in Progress" registry key, you must have already
restored the database, patch, and log files from a tape.

Paste the following worksheet in a text editor:

   

   Transaction Logs Path:  
   Working Path:  
   Number of databases:  
   Server from which backup was taken:  
   Server to which backup is being restored:  
   LowLog Number:  
   HighLog Number:

Fill in the worksheet with the following information:

 - The current path to the database and log files. You may view this information
   in the registry.

   For the directory service:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeDS\Parameters
   (database log files path, directory service database file, directory service
   working directory)

   For the information store:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersPrivate
   (database path)

   -and-

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersPublic
   (database path)

   -and-

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersSystem
   (database log path, working directory)

   NOTE: It is a good idea to document this information permanently for all of
   your Exchange Server computers. You can do this by using the Exchange Server
   Administrator program. The <Server> object for each server records the
   local data paths on the Database Paths property page.

 - The LowLog and HighLog value numbers for the full backup. This information
   can be obtained from the Priv.pat file by the procedure described in the "How
   to Tell If Hard Recovery Has Finished" section of this article.

 - If the paths have changed since the backup was taken, you must know the
   original database file path locations. You can get this information from the
   LowLog transaction log by using the following command

   ESEUTIL /ML <LowLog_file>

   where <LowLog_file> is the lowest numbered log file name.

   The output is similar to the following:

   

   E:\exchsrvr\mdbdata>ESEUTIL /ML EDB00036.LOG

      1 E:\EXCHSRVR\MDBDATA\PRIV.EDB
         dbtime: 326969 (0,0)
          objid: 76
      Signature: Create time:8/19/1999 19:37:35 Rand:39623424 Computer:
   DatabaseSizeMax: 0
      Last Attach (6,3111,100)  Last Consistent (0,0,0)
      2 E:\EXCHSRVR\MDBDATA\PUB.EDB
         dbtime: 3890 (0,0)
          objid: 105
      Signature: Create time:8/19/1999 19:37:36 Rand:39631469 Computer:
   DatabaseSizeMax: 0
   Last Attach (6,3575,345)  Last Consistent (0,0,0) 

   NOTE: The /ML switch is only available for Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 1
   or later. If you are running an earlier version of Exchange Server, you must
   know your original path locations in advance.

 - You must know the number of databases that are attached to the service. In
   the example above of a typical information store, the number was two.

 - If you want to restore the backup to a different server, you must know the
   name of the original server. If you do not know the name of the original
   server, you cannot easily obtain it from the backup data. The server name is
   not contained in the information store files. If you try to start the
   directory service files on a server that has the wrong name, the directory
   service files log an error message and report the expected server name in the
   Windows NT Event Viewer.

After you have all of this information, you are ready to create the "Restore in
Progress" registry key:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe, not Regedit.exe).

2. Locate one of the following keys in the registry, as applicable:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeDS

   -or-

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS

3. Select either MSExchangeDS or MSExchangeIS as applicable, and then click Add
   Key on the Edit menu. Type the following (case-sensitive) key name:

   Restore in Progress

   Leave the Class box blank, and then click OK.

4. To create each value in the key, click to select Restore in Progress, click
   Add Value on the Edit menu, and then add the following registry values (type
   the value names exactly, and match the case):

   Value Name: BackupLogPath
   Data Type: REG_SZ
   String: \\<SERVERNAME>\<D>$\<logpath>

   For example:

   \\NEWSERVER\f$\exchsrvr\mdbdata

   Value Name: CheckpointFilePath
   Data Type: REG_SZ
   String: \\<SERVERNAME>\<D>$\<workingpath>
   For example:

   \\NEWSERVER\c$\exchsrvr\mdbdata

   Value Name: EDB Database recovered
   Data Type: REG_BINARY
   Data Format: Hex
   Data: 00

   Value Name: EDB_RstMap
   Data Type: REG_MULTI_SZ
   Data: \\<BACKUPSERVER>\<D>$\<dbpath>\<dbname>.EDB
   \\<RESTORESERVER>\<D>$\<dbpath>\<dbname>.EDB
   For example:

   \\OLDSERVER\c$\exchsrvr\MDBDATA\PRIV.EDB
   \\NEWSERVER\d$\exchsrvr\MDBDATA\PRIV.EDB
   \\OLDSERVER\c$\exchsrvr\MDBDATA\PUB.EDB
   \\NEWSERVER\e$\exchsrvr\MDBDATA\PUB.EDB

   NOTE: If you restore two databases, there are four lines in the EDB_RstMap
   value; a "before" and "after" line for each database. The lines of each pair
   only differ if you have changed servers or paths. Press the ENTER key at the
   end of each line, except for the last line.

   Value Name: EDB_RstMap Size
   Data Type: REG_DWORD
   Radix: Decimal
   Data: 1 or 2

   Value Name: HighLog Number
   Data Type: REG_DWORD
   Radix: Hex
   Data: High log number from either the .pat file or the highest log number
   restored from an incremental tape.
   For example:

   3f

   Value Name: LogPath
   Data Type: REG_SZ
   String: \\<SERVERNAME>\<D>$\<logpath>
   For example:

   \\NEWSERVER\f$\exchsrvr\mdbdata

   Value Name: LowLog Number
   Data Type: REG_DWORD
   Radix: Hex
   Data: Low log number from the .pat file.
   IMPORTANT: Do not put any other number here.
   For example:

   36

Interpreting Error Messages During Startup of a Restored Database
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Many of the reasons a restored database may not start are similar to the reasons
that an ordinary startup does not work. The error codes that are displayed
during hard recovery are different than the error codes that are displayed
normally. If you can correlate the hard recovery error codes with their soft
recovery counterparts, you can find valuable KB articles and other resources
that you otherwise might overlook.

If you start a restored database from the command line or check the Event Viewer,
decimal or hexadecimal failure codes of the following form are displayed:

   335544nnnn

   -or-

   0xc8000nnn

During an ordinary database startup, the same error would have the following
forms:

   42949nnnnn

   -or-

   0xfffffnnn

For example, one of the most common error codes that may be displayed after you
restore an online backup is 3355443730 (decimal) or 0xc8000212 (hexadecimal).
During an ordinary startup of the database, this same error is reported as
4294966766 or 0xfffffdee. All of these error numbers correspond to -530
(JET_errBadLogSignature).

NOTE: The Error.exe utility that is included on all versions of the Exchange
Server Setup CD-ROM can translate error codes between hexadecimal and decimal
forms, and can provide text representations of many errors.

If you enter multiple forms of an error code (separated by "or" (without the
quotation marks)) in a Microsoft Knowledge Base search string, you greatly
increase your chances of finding valuable information about the causes of the
error code.

Be aware that a single problem may be reported as several successive events
during startup, as various subcomponents in the service each report the problem
independently. These multiple error codes provide additional information about
the modules that are affected by the problem, but they can be confusing and may
lead you to believe that there are multiple problems. If several error codes are
displayed in a row during startup, they most likely report on the same error.
