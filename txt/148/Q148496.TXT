SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Exchange administrators have the ability to support roving users
running from a network installation of Windows 3.1 and 3.11. Roving users are
individuals that are not tied to a specific machine. They need access to their
Microsoft Exchange accounts regardless of their physical location on the
network.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Administrators can run the following steps to create a default profile that can
be customized for each Microsoft Exchange Windows client user:

1. The network administrator will need to create home directories on the network
   for each user and assign logon scripts that will automatically connect those
   users to their home directory.

2. From the Microsoft Exchange Win16 client share point, run SETUP /a to create
   a network installation of the Microsoft Exchange Win16 client.

   NOTE: You must be logged in with Administrator privileges and be running the
   same shared copy of Windows that the users will be running. This is because
   the network installation will add files to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory that
   are required by the Microsoft Exchange client.

3. Run the Microsoft Exchange Setup Editor against this network client
   installation share point to make any desired changes in the Setup Options a
   user will see when running the client Setup Program. The Microsoft Exchange
   Setup Editor can also be used to modify default Microsoft Exchange user
   profile information. Save the changes you have made and exit the Setup
   Editor. This will modify the SETUP.STF file in the client network
   installation directory and create a file called DEFAULT.PRF if it does not
   already exist.

4. Each user should be configured to run Windows from the network.

5. Each user should now run SETUP.EXE from the Microsoft Exchange Win16 client
   network installation point. Select the Workstation installation option. This
   will install the client so that it runs from the server. The Setup program
   will now create the user's default profile, based on the settings in the
   DEFAULT.PRF file in the client network installation share point. This default
   profile will be created in the user's home directory on the server if the
   user is set up to run Windows from this directory.

6. Each user should now be able to move to any similarly configured machine,
   running Windows from the network, and be able to run the Microsoft Exchange
   client using the same profile.
