1.0  INSTALLATION ISSUES

1.1 Upgrading From Pre-release Version
--------------------------------------
If you are installing File and Print Services for NetWare on a computer
already running a pre-release version of the utility, use the following
procedure. Do not use the Update option in the Network Settings dialog
box, as the pre-release versions are not compatible with the
installation program in the commercial release.

1. Double-click the Network icon in Control Panel.

2. In the Installed Network Software list of the Network Settings
   dialog box, select File and Print Services for NetWare, and then
   choose Remove.

3. Follow the instructions on the screen to remove the pre-release
   version from your computer.

4. During the removal of the pre-release version, if you are
   prompted "Is this the last FPNW Server in the Domain?", specify
   No. If you specify Yes, all the FPNW passwords of all user
   accounts that are NetWare-enabled will be lost.

5. Install File and Print Services using the instructions in the
   Administrator's Guide.

   IMPORTANT- When you update your server with this version of File
   and Print Services for NetWare, you must select <Other> in the
   Add Network Software dialog box; do not select "File and Print
   Services for NetWare" from the list in this dialog box. (If you
   do not select <Other>, the pre-release setup file will be used
   for the installation and not all components will be updated.)

1.2 Installing File and Print Services for NetWare From Floppy Disks
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to install File and Print Services for NetWare on a computer
that does not have a CD-ROM drive, you can use the File and Print Services
for NetWare CD to create 3.5-inch floppy disks that you can use for
installation.

To create floppy disks for installation:

1. Get two formatted, blank, high-density 3.5-inch floppy disks.

2. At a computer that has a CD-ROM drive, insert the File and Print
   Services for NetWare CD-ROM.

3. Change directories to the DISKS directory on the CD-ROM. Then
   change directories to the subdirectory for the platform for
   which you want to create installation disks; for example, change
   to DISKS\i386 if you want to create disks to use to install
   the utility on an x86-based computer. The subdirectories are
   i386 for x86-based computers; ALPHA for DEC Alpha computers;
   MIPS for RISC-based computers; and PPC for PowerPC-based
   computers.

4. Copy the contents of the DISK1 subdirectory to one of the floppy
   disks, and then copy the contents of the DISK2 subdirectory to
   the other floppy disk.

To install the utility using the floppy disks you have made:

*  Follow the installation instructions in the Administrator's Guide,
   but in the Insert Disk dialog box, specify the drive containing
   the floppy disk.

1.3 Must Install NWLink Before File and Print Services for NetWare
------------------------------------------------------------------
Before you can install File and Print Services for NetWare on a computer,
the computer must have the NWLink IPX/SPX Compatible Transport installed.
If you attempt to install File and Print Services for NetWare and NWLink
is not already installed, you will be prompted to use the Windows NT
Server media to install NWLink.

To install NWLink before you install File and Print Services for NetWare,
use the Network icon in Control Panel and choose the Add Software button.

2.0  MIGRATION TOOL FOR NETWARE

2.1 Migration Tool Requires Client or Gateway Service for NetWare
-----------------------------------------------------------------
To use the Migration Tool for NetWare, Client Service for NetWare
or Gateway Service for NetWare must be installed on the computer
from which you are running the Migration Tool for NetWare.

2.2 Use Migration Tool for NetWare Only on Domain Controllers
-------------------------------------------------------------
The Migration Tool for NetWare supports migrating information from NetWare
servers to Windows NT Server computers functioning as primary domain
controllers or backup domain controllers. It does not support Windows NT
Server computers running in the "server" role.

2.3 Using Migration Tool for NetWare to Migrate Login Scripts
-------------------------------------------------------------
If you want Migration Tool for NetWare to migrate login scripts or
the information contained in users' mail directories, from a
NetWare server to a Windows NT Server computer, then you must do the
following: in the Migration Tool, once you have selected a pair of
servers for migration, choose File Options, select the SYS
volume, select FILES, and then enable the transfer of the MAIL
subdirectory.

3.0  CHANGING PASSWORDS

3.1 CHGPASS.EXE and SETPASS.EXE Are Merged
------------------------------------------
After the Administrator's Guide was printed, the CHGPASS and SETPASS
utilities were merged. The new merged utility appears twice on the File
and Print Services for NetWare CD, as both CHGPASS.EXE and SETPASS.EXE.

CHGPASS and SETPASS both now change both a user's Windows NT Server
password and FPNW password, providing users with an easy way to change
their passwords and keep them synchronized.

In situations where the primary domain controller of the domain where the
user's account is located does not both run Gateway Service for NetWare
and have File and Print Services for NetWare installed, then CHGPASS and
SETPASS change only the user's FPNW password. The same is true when
the user's client computer cannot access the primary domain controller
over the IPX/SPX protocol.

Note that CHGPASS, SETPASS, and LOGIN all require the .RPC support
files, RPC16C1.RPC, RPC16C6.RPC, and SECURITY.RPC. Also, these .RPC
support files must be in a user's search path. If you have users copy
any of these utilities and the .RPC support files to their own hard
drives,
you must ensure that the .RPC files are in a directory in the user's
search path.

4.0 PRINTING NOTES

4.1 Setting Up a Print Server to Service a Printer Queue on a
    Different File Server
-------------------------------------------------------------
Use the following procedure to set up a print server to service a printer
queue located at another server. In this situation, either server can be
running File and Print Services for NetWare.

1. On the server where the printer is physically located, create a printer
   queue.

2. On the other server, create a printer queue. If this server is running
   File and Print Services for NetWare, set the queue to print to a
   NetWareCompatiblePServerx port, and be sure to select the Share This
   Printer On the Network box.

3. On each server, create a print server. These two print servers must
   have the same name.

4. On each server, add the other server as a file server to be services by
   the local print server.

5. On the server where the printer is physically located, create a
   printer. Set it to print to the port to which the printer is physically
   attached.

6. On the other server, create a printer, with the same name as the
   printer you created in step 5. Set the printer's type to Defines
   Elsewhere.

7. If you have made any changes to the print server software, unload the
   software and reload it.

4.2 Network Print Server Devices Tested
---------------------------------------
File and Print Services for NetWare has been tested with the following
network print server devices:

   HP JetDirect Cards
   Intel NetPort XL
   Xircom II series
   Milan FastPort 3000 series
   Digital NetPrint 100
   Emulex NetJet Card
   AXIS NPS 550
   Extended Systems ESI-2866A

4.3 Setting Up the Milan Network Print Server Device
----------------------------------------------------
To successfully set up File and Print Services for NetWare to print to a
printer attached to a Milan network print server device, use the following
procedure:

1. Use Print Manager to create a logical printer for the printer. Be
   sure to do the following in the Printer Properties dialog box:

   *  In the Print To box, specify NetWareCompatiblePServer0 or
      NetWareCompatiblePServer1

   *  Mark the Share This Printer On The Network check box.

2. In Server Manager, choose Print Servers from the FPNW menu.

3. Choose the Add button, and specify FPxxxxxx in the Print Server box,
   where xxxxxx are the last 6 characters of the Milan MAC address. You
   can find the address printed on the bottom of the device. Then choose
   OK.

4. Back in the Print Servers On dialog box, select the print server you
   created in step 3, and then choose Printers.

5. In the Printers on Print Server dialog box, choose the Add button.

6. Fill out the Add Printer To dialog box with information for the
   printer. Be sure to specify Remote Other/Unknown in the Type box.
   Then choose OK.

7. Back in the Printers on Print Server dialog box, choose the Queues
   button, and add the queue you created in step 1.

4.4 Miscellaneous Printing Notes
--------------------------------
If you find that print jobs sent from NetWare clients to File and Print
Services for NetWare printers are not printing banner sheets, or are not
notifying clients correctly, you should check certain printer properties.

To check the printer properties:

1. Start Print Manager.

2. Select the printer, and then choose Properties from the Printer
   menu.

3. Check that the Print To box is set correctly, to either a
   NetWareCompatiblePServer port or a local port, such as LPT1:

4. Check that the Share This Printer On The Network box is selected.

5. Choose the Details button, and then check that the Print Processor
   box is set to nwprint.

6. Choose OK.

7. Close Print Manager, and then stop and restart the File and Print
   Services for NetWare service.

Similarly, if you have two printer queues that use the same printer, and
one of the printer queues has the Job Type set to WINPRINT, then jobs in
that queue may freeze with the message "Waiting for PServer", causing both
queues to freeze. To correct this problem, stop and restart the print
server software, or stop and restart the File and Print Services for
NetWare service.

5.0 MISCELLANEOUS NOTES

5.1 Default Permissions on SYS Volume
-------------------------------------
When you install File and Print Services for NetWare on a server, and you
specify a directory that does not already exist as the server's SYS
volume, File and Print Services for NetWare creates this directory. Be
aware that by default, Everyone is given Full Control for this directory.
If you want different permissions for the SYS volume root directory, you
must edit the directory permissions using File Manager.

It is especially important to adjust permissions for the SYS volume if you
plan to use Migration Tool for NetWare to migrate directories from NetWare
servers to be subdirectories of the SYS volume, as these migrated
directories will inherit permissions from the SYS volume root directory.

5.2 Two Checkboxes Are Mutually Exclusive
-----------------------------------------
On a server running File and Print Services for NetWare, the "Users Must
Log On In Order To Change Password" check box (in the Account Policy
dialog box) and the "User Must Change Password at Next Logon" check box
(in the User Properties dialog box for each user account) are mutually
exclusive.

If the "Users Must Log On In Order To Change Password" check box is
marked, then users who have the "User Must Change Password at Next Logon"
check box marked in their accounts will not be able to use CHGPASS (or
SETPASS or LOGIN) to change their passwords after they have logged on to
the server.

It is recommended that you do not have both these check boxes marked for
File and Print Services for NetWare users.

5.3 Volume Name Restrictions
----------------------------
Be sure to include at least two characters in volume names. Users will be
unable to connect to volumes with names with only one character.

Also, do not include either forward slashes (/) or backslashes (\) in
volume names.

5.4 Using Windows NT Server as a Client to Connect to NetWare Servers
---------------------------------------------------------------------
On a computer running Windows NT Server and File and Print Services for
NetWare, the automatic restoration of connections from that computer to
NetWare servers may not work if the computer does not have a preferred
server selected, and a user logs in immediately after booting the
computer. This happens because the Windows NT Server computer does not
have time to gather information about available NetWare servers before
attempting to restore connections.

5.5 "Operators" and "Users" Buttons Reserved for Future Versions
----------------------------------------------------------------
The Operators and Users buttons in the Print Servers For dialog box do not
have any functionality in this release of File and Print Services for
NetWare. They are reserved for use for added functionality in future
versions of the utility.

6.0 APPLICATION NOTES

6.1 Seeing Users Listed Multiple Times Within Applications
----------------------------------------------------------
When using certain applications that reference the server's database of
users, the application may list the same user multiple times in one list.
This may mean that the user is logged in from multiple workstations,
or it could also be the case that this is a display error caused by
the application because it cannot handle a server with more than 256
connections.

If you require this listing to be accurate, you reduce the maximum
number of concurrent connections to FPNW by using the MaxUsers value
in the Registry. See Appendix A of the Administrator's Guide for more
details.

6.2 Other Application Notes
----------------------------
Some applications require a different serial number. If you need to
change the File and Print Services for NetWare serial number, you can do
so using the registry. See Appendix A of the File and Print Services for
NetWare Administrator's Guide for more information.

Some server-management applications enable you to rename groups. Windows
NT Server does not support renaming of groups, so these functions do not
work on servers running File and Print Services for NetWare.

Also, File and Print Services for NetWare currently does not support
user-defined printer queues. You must use Print Manager to create queues.

Some third-party NetWare-compatible utilities may take an extended time
to return values. This may be caused by the following:

- File and Print Services for NetWare supports only printer queues created
  using Print Manager.

- The maximum number of users defaults to 10,000 users.  Some utilities
  may try to enumerate all connections. To correct this, adjust the
  MaxUsers value in the Registry. For more information, see Appendix A
  of the File and Print Services for NetWare Administrator's Guide.

7.0 DOCUMENTATION Notes

7.1 Installing and Using the Online Administrator's Guide
---------------------------------------------------------
The File and Print Services for NetWare Administrator's Guide is also
provided in an online format on the File and Print Services for NetWare
CD.

The online book is not automatically installed on your hard drive when you
install File and Print Services for NetWare. You can use the online book
directly from the CD, or you can manually install the online book files
(approximately 563K) on a hard disk and use them from there.

If you want to copy the online book files to a hard drive, copy all of the
files from the ONLINE.DOC directory of the CD to the hard drive.

To use the online book, you should first create a program item for it.

To create a program item for the online book:

1.  In Program Manager, open the program group to which you want to add
    the Online Books icon.

    You may want to use a common group rather than a personal group so
    that anyone who logs on to this computer can view the books.

2.  From the File menu, choose New. Then select Program Item and choose
    OK. The Program Item Properties dialog box appears.

3.  In the Description box, type a description, such as Online FPNW Admin
    Guide.

4.  In the Command Line box, type the path to the MSFPNW.HLP file. For
    example, if you are using the books from CD and the CD is in drive E,
    type E:\ONLINE.DOC\MSFPNW.HLP.

5.  Choose OK.

    The dialog box closes, and a generic Help icon appears in the chosen
    group.

To change the generic help icon to the Online Book icon:

1.  Select the Online FPNW Admin Guide program item.

2.  From the File menu, choose Properties.

3.  In the Program Item Properties dialog box, choose the Change Icon
    button.

4.  In the File Name box, type the path to the BOOKS.ICO file, and then
    choose OK.

7.2 System Login Script File is Incorrectly Listed
--------------------------------------------------
The Administrator's Guide lists an incorrect filename for the NetWare
system login script. The correct file is NET$LOG.DAT. Edit this file,
using Notepad or another text editor, to edit the server's system login
script.

7.3 SYS Volume Incorrectly Referenced
-------------------------------------
Page 6 of the File and Print Services for NetWare Administrator's Guide
lists the wrong default name for the SYS volume. The correct default
volume name is SYS, and the directory represented by it is SYSVOL.

7.4 User Interface Changes After Administrator's Guide Was Printed
------------------------------------------------------------------
After the Administrator's Guide was printed, the names of some fields and
boxes in the user interface were changed slightly. These changes do not
represent any changes in functionality or in how to accomplish tasks using
the interface.

7.5 RPRINTER not Supported
-------------------------------------
Page 57 of the File and Print Services for NetWare Administrator's Guide
incorrectly references the RPRINTER utility. This utility is actually not
supported by File and Print Services for NetWare.
