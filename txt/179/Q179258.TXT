SUMMARY
=======

When you are planning an upgrade from Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 or
5.0 to Exchange Server version 5.5, many factors must be taken into
consideration. This article emphasizes some of the more common points found in
this transition. The following list does not contain all the factors that you
may want to consider; however, it can be used as a guideline to help you
evaluate your decision to upgrade to Exchange Server 5.5.

The Exchange 5.5 Administrator program can be used to administer Exchange Server
4.0 and 5.0 so that the upgrade process may be performed one server at a time.

Before you upgrade to Exchange Server 5.5, review the readme document located on
the root directory of the Exchange Server 5.5 CD. Also, be sure to make a
complete backup of your existing Exchange Server computer before beginning the
installation process.

Things to consider when you upgrade to Exchange Server 5.5:

1. Upgrade time: The time required to upgrade to Exchange Server 5.5 from
   Exchange Server 4.0 is approximately twice as long as the time required to
   upgrade a similar server from Exchange Server 5.0 to Exchange Server 5.5.

2. The number of messages, the number of folders, and the total size of the
   message database determine the amount of time required to upgrade. You can
   reduce the upgrade time by having users reduce the amount of mail they keep
   on the server.

3. Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 can coexist in the same site with Exchange
   Server 4.0 or 5.0. You can take advantage of this compatibility to minimize
   downtime and spread out the upgrade process by bringing up a new Exchange
   Server 5.5 computer in the same site. This approach is useful for upgrading
   mailbox servers. If the server also hosts public folder data, see
   "Replicating Public Folders," in the Exchange Server 5.5 readme document for
   more information. If you are introducing new hardware components to support
   large information stores or clustering, moving mailboxes can significantly
   decrease the time required to migrate to Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5.

4. The key differences between Exchange Server 5.0 and Exchange Server 5.5:
   Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 builds on the success of Exchange Server 5.0 as
   a robust messaging and collaboration platform. The new version provides
   greater scalability and turnkey connectivity with more systems, including
   Notes, PROFS, and SNADS. New features enable a wide range of collaborative
   solutions from departmental workflow to cross-divisional line-of-business
   applications. Management is made easier through the addition of customer
   requested administrative features such as deleted item recovery. Exchange
   Server 5.5 also adds support for additional Internet protocols, such as IMAP4
   and LDAPv3, and improves support for mobile users. Full details on new
   features may be found at the following Web address:

   http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/evaluation/overview/howeval.asp

5. Internet Information Server (IIS) 3.0 is supported in both the 5.0 and 5.5
   releases of Exchange Server; however, support for IIS 4.0 will only be
   available in the Exchange Server 5.5 release. If you plan to use IIS 4.0 for
   Outlook Web Access components, you will need to install Exchange Server 5.5
   on that server (all other servers can still use Exchange Server 5.0). You may
   be able to upgrade to IIS 4.0 if IIS 3.0 is functioning correctly on the
   Exchange Server 5.0 computer, but this configuration is not supported by
   Microsoft.

6. Exchange Server 5.5 only ships with Outlook clients (Windows 3.x, Windows 95,
   Windows NT, and Macintosh versions). The 4.0 and 5.0 Exchange clients can
   still be used to connect to an Exchange Server 5.5 computer, but there will
   not be an Exchange 5.5 client.

7. Exchange Server 5.5 setup offers Exchange Server 5.0 users two upgrade
   options: an "In Place" upgrade and a "Fault Tolerant" upgrade.

   An "In place" upgrade upgrades the Exchange 5.0 database to the new Jet '97
   format in its current location. If the database upgrade process fails, the
   database may be rendered useless and a restore will need to be done before
   the upgrade can proceed again. A full backup of the databases is recommended
   before beginning the upgrade process.

   A "Fault Tolerant" upgrade upgrades the database in a specified temporary
   location. When the upgrade procedure is finished on all three databases, it
   copies the newly upgraded databases to the old database location.

8. Differences between the Standard and Enterprise Editions: Microsoft Exchange
   Server 5.5 Enterprise Edition is designed for organizations that require the
   highest levels of scalability, interoperability, and availability. The
   Enterprise Edition includes all of the features of the Standard Edition plus
   an unlimited data store (constrained only by the server hardware capacity),
   e-mail connectivity with IBM, PROFS, and SNADS messaging systems, X.400
   connectivity, and support for Microsoft Cluster Server. These features extend
   the core functionality of the Standard Edition, such as built in SMTP support
   to yield the most comprehensive single product solution for corporate
   communication and collaboration.

   Note: The Standard Edition still has a limit of 16 gigabytes for the
   Information Store. Only the Enterprise Edition allows databases to grow
   larger than 16 gigabytes.

9. Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 3 is required to install Microsoft
   Exchange Server. It is strongly recommended that you upgrade your Microsoft
   Exchange Server computer to Windows NT Service Pack 4 when it is available.
   Until that time, you should install the hot fixes that are currently
   available from:

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/nt40/hotfixes-postsp3/roll-up/

   If you are using Microsoft Exchange Server in a clustering environment, these
   hot fixes are required. If you install Microsoft Outlook Web Access on your
   Microsoft Exchange Server computer, these hot fixes are strongly
   recommended.


10. Before you run the Exchange Server 5.5 setup, shut down all monitors,
   including Event Viewer, Performance Monitor, Server Monitor, and Link
   Monitor.

11. When you install Outlook Web Access, you should install the Windows NT hot
   fix that addresses problems with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and memory
   leaks. For more information, see the Microsoft Knowledge Base on the
   Microsoft Product Support Services Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/support

   You can download the hot fix from:

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/iis/iis-public/fixes/usa/ASP/asp-memfix/

   The self-extracting zip file is called Asp-memfix.exe. For more information,
   see the Microsoft Knowledge Base articles, Q176245 XWEB: VBScript Error when
   Accessing Outlook Web Access Server and Q176246 XWEB: Unexpected Behavior
   when Accessing Outlook Web Access.

   NOTE: ASP-memfix.exe is for use with IIS 3.0 and NOT for IIS 4.0.

   If installing Outlook Web Access with IIS 4.0, the Window NT 4.0 post Service
   Pack 3 hotfixes should be installed. If these are not, errors will occur
   that will prevent installation of the OWA components. The post SP3 hotfixes
   can be obtained from the following location:

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/nt40/hotfixes-postsp3/roll-up

   NOTE: Roll-upa.exe is the hotfix for the Alpha platform. Roll-upi.exe is the
   hotfix for the Intel platform. Both files are self-extracting executables.

12. If you install Microsoft Outlook version 8.03 on a Microsoft Exchange Server
   5.5 computer, Outlook Web Access does not perform as expected. To solve this
   problem, run Regsvr32a.exe after you install Outlook. This utility resets
   the affected registry settings by reregistering Cdo.dll. You can download
   Regsvr32a.exe from the Microsoft web site at:

   http://support.microsoft.com/support/downloads/dp2439.asp

   Run Regsvr32.exe from the command line using the full path to Cdo.dll as the
   argument. For example, the following command changes the registry settings
   by re-registering Cdo.dll:

   Regsvr32.exe <systemroot>\system32\cdo.dll (where <systemroot> is
   your Windows NT directory)

   For more information, see the Microsoft Knowledge Base article, Q176744 XCLN:
   Installing Outlook on OWA Server Causes Access Failure.

13. If you need to run Internet Explorer 4.0 and Microsoft Exchange Server on
   the same computer, it is strongly recommended that you install Internet
   Explorer 4.0 before you install Microsoft Exchange Server. If you install
   Internet Explorer 4.0 after installing Microsoft Exchange Server, Internet
   Explorer modifies the MIME registry database, resulting in problems for
   international mail, especially mail with double-byte character content.

14. Database files cannot reside on a Distributed File System (DFS) partition
   because some Windows NT Server functionality used by Microsoft Exchange
   Server does not support DFS partitions. If you locate database files on a
   DFS partition, services will fail to start and will generate a 1022
   (JET_errDiskIO) error message. This problem will be addressed in a future
   release of Windows NT Server.

15. You cannot run Microsoft Exchange Server setup in recovery mode (setup /R)
   with a batch mode .ini file. If you attempt to run setup /R /Q inifile_name,
   Setup ignores the /R command.

16. If you install or upgrade Microsoft Exchange Server on a computer that
   already has the Chat Service installed, you must stop the Chat Service
   before running Microsoft Exchange Server setup.

17. After you upgrade from Exchange Server 5.0, the first time the message
   transfer agent (MTA) is started the MTA database files (mtadata\db*.dat) are
   migrated to Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 format. This results in
   several warning events regarding integrity verification, including warnings
   2219, 2206, and 2207. This is expected; you can ignore these warnings.

18. To start or stop Microsoft Exchange Server services on a clustered server,
   you must use the Cluster Administrator program. Using the Services
   application in Control Panel to start or stop Microsoft Exchange Server
   services can result in unpredictable behavior, including initiating failover
   of these services.

19. The maximum number of characters allowed in Windows NT user accounts is
   twenty. Therefore, if you use the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator
   program to create a Windows NT user account at the same time you are
   creating a mailbox, the e-mail alias for the mailbox cannot be longer than
   twenty characters. For double-byte languages, the e-mail alias is limited to
   ten characters because each character takes up two conventional characters.
