TITLE   :STOP 0x0000000A or 0x00000019 Due to Modified Teardrop Attack
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT may stop responding (hang) with a STOP 0x0000000A or 0x00000019
message after receiving a number of deliberately corrupted UDP packets.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs due to a variation of the "teardrop" attack. Windows NT 4.0
with Service Pack 3 and the ICMP-fix is not susceptible to the original form of
the teardrop attack. For more information on the ICMP- fix, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   ARTICLE-ID: Q154174
   TITLE : Invalid ICMP Datagram Fragments Hang Windows NT, Windows 95

The modified teardrop attack works by sending pairs of deliberately constructed
IP fragments which are reassembled into an invalid UDP datagram. Overlapping
offsets cause the second packet to overwrite data in the middle of the UDP
header contained in the first packet in such a way that the datagrams are left
incomplete.

As Windows NT receives these invalid datagrams, it allocates kernel memory. If
enough of these invalid datagrams are received Windows NT may hang with a STOP
0x0000000A or 0x00000019.


RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,

STATUS
======

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

Microsoft has confirmed this problem could result in some degree of security
vulnerability in Windows NT version 4.0. This problem was first corrected in
Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server
Edition Service Pack 4.


Windows NT 3.51
---------------

Microsoft has confirmed this problem could result in some degree of security
vulnerability in Windows NT version 3.51. A fully supported fix is now
available, but it has not been fully regression tested and should only be
applied to systems determined to be at risk of attack. Please evaluate your
system's physical accessibility, network and Internet connectivity, and other
factors to determine the degree of risk to your system. If your system is
sufficiently at risk, Microsoft recommends you apply this fix. Otherwise, wait
for the next Windows NT service pack, which will contain this fix. Please
contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.
