This file contains information to help you troubleshoot issues with MechWarrior:
Vengeance. You can find more information about MechWarrior: Vengeance and
Microsoft Product Support Services in the printed manual and on the MechWarrior:
Vengeance Web site (http://www.microsoft.com/games/mechwarrior4/).

F. Configuration Issues
-----------------------

Known hardware and operating system configuration issues are listed in this
section. For issues with specific 3D cards, see section H, "3D Card Issues."

Operating Systems:

Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) for Multiplayer

 - Playing by going through a Windows Millennium Internet Connection Sharing
   (ICS) machine: This works properly for Windows Millennium and non-Windows
   Millennium machines (that have DirectX 8 installed), except in a ZoneMatch
   instance.

 - Playing by going through a Windows 2000 ICS machine: Only one client at a
   time can play through the server to the Internet, with either DirectX
   versions 7 or 8.

 - Playing by going through a Windows 98 SE ICS machine: This operating system
   does not support the DirectPlay Protocol Flag, so no users can play.

Windows 2000

AGP aperture size and Windows 2000 stability: If you are experiencing stability
issues such as system reboots and system hangs while running MechWarrior:
Vengeance under Windows 2000, first make sure you have the latest Windows 2000
drivers installed for all of your hardware and motherboard. Also, install the
latest Service Packs for Windows 2000. Finally, try lowering the AGP aperture
size to increase the stability of your system. Contact your motherboard
manufacturer about how to change your AGP aperture size.

Windows 2000 and AMD Athlon/Duron processors: Stability issues may arise when
playing on a computer with an AMD Athlon/Duron processor, which uses the AMD
751/756 motherboard chipset. Make sure you have the latest AMD software drivers
and patches installed on your computer. They can be found at
http://www.amd.com/support/software.html and
http://www.amd.com/products/cpg/athlon-duron/amd_win2k_patch.html.

Windows 98

Game minimizes when network connection is made: When the user interface is used
to establish a dial-up connection, the game minimizes after the connection is
established. To fix this, simply maximize the game from the Windows taskbar.

Windows 95

Windows 95 Gold: To run MechWarrior: Vengeance on Windows 95 Gold, you must have
the latest Indeo Video 3.2, 4.5, 5.11, and Indeo Audio 2.5 codecs installed. You
can download them from http://www.ligos.com/indeo/downloads/form.shtm.

Multiplayer: If you are running Windows 95 and you have not installed Internet
Explorer 4.0 or later, you need to upgrade the networking on your computer to
play MechWarrior: Vengeance. To do this, double-click Ws2setup.exe on CD1 in
\Goodies\Wsock2.

NOTE: This upgrade detects versions of Windows later than Windows 95 and will NOT
install over them. This download is not intended for use on computers running
Windows 98.

Display:

NVIDIA TNT and GeForce cards: When running MechWarrior: Vengeance on a system
with a GeForce or TNT card and an ASUS motherboard, you may experience a
periodic crash or hang. This is a display driver issue and NVIDIA is working to
resolve it. If you get this problem, contact your manufacturer for driver
updates.

Via chipsets: Stability issues may occur with these motherboard chipsets when not
using the latest drivers. To fix this, download and install the latest chipset
drivers for your motherboard (http://www.viatech.com/).

AMD Athlon/Duron processors: If you experience instability when running
MechWarrior: Vengeance, download and install the latest AMD processor utilities
and drivers for your operating system (http://www.amd.com/support/software.html)
and (http://www.amd.com/products/cpg/athlon-duron/amd_win2k_patch.html).

Audio:

Vortex 2 audio chipset (Turtle Beach Montego II, Diamond Monster Sound MX-300)
compatibility with Windows 2000: You may experience choppy playback of audio
during the installation of MechWarrior: Vengeance as well as other anomalies or
even lock-ups in the game. The original manufacturer of the Vortex 2 chipset,
Aureal Semiconductor, has gone out of business. No driver updates are available
for Vortex 2-based sound cards running on Windows 2000, other than the generic
Vortex 2 driver included with Windows 2000. Contact your hardware manufacturer
for updated drivers. For reference drivers, visit http://support.a3d.com/.

Alternatively, try the following solution:

1. Click Start on the Windows taskbar, point to Settings, and then click Control
   Panel.

2. Double-click Multimedia, and then click the Audio tab.

3. Under Playback, click Advanced Properties, and then click the Performance
   tab.

4. Drag the Hardware Acceleration slider to the left by 2 settings, and then
   click OK.

Software:

Software DVD Players: Certain display cards (for example, those in the Maxi Gamer
Xentor family) that come bundled with software DVD players may experience
problems when trying to start MechWarrior: Vengeance due to the opening cinemas
being in the MPEG format. To correct this, contact your hardware manufacturer
for updated software. If problems persist, uninstall the software DVD player,
and the game should start and play normally.

Winsock 2.0 required to play network games: If you receive an error message
referring to Winsock 2.0, manually install it by double-clicking Ws2setup.exe on
CD1 in \Goodies\Wsock2.

NetMeeting disables hardware acceleration: If NetMeeting is running, or Remote
Desktop Sharing is enabled, you will have no hardware acceleration to run
MechWarrior: Vengeance. This also happens when NetMeeting has improperly shut
down. To fix this, properly shut down NetMeeting from within the application, or
disable Remote Desktop Sharing if you have it enabled.

Hardware:

Microsoft Dual Strike Joystick: You need to enable FX Mode in the Dual Strike
software. You also need to enable the mouse in the Options menu in the game to
be able to use the free look ability during game play.

Mitsumi CD-ROM drive: You may experience issues when launching MechWarrior:
Vengeance with this CD-ROM drive. Please contact your hardware manufacturer for
firmware updates.

Creative 48x CD-ROM drive: Trying to launch MechWarrior: Vengeance with this
CD-ROM drive causes an error message to appear. Bypass this by clicking Continue
to play the game.

G. Zone Stats
-------------

Through Zone.com, game statistics and player ranking information is available
(http://stats.zone.com/). Additionally, with the Zone's own ZoneMatch
matchmaking service you can search for, find, and play games over the Internet
from within the game itself.

Use the following procedure to set up statistical tracking for your games.

To track game statistics

1. On the Host Setup screen, select Report Game Stats to stats.Zone.

2. On the Multiplayer Options screen, select the Track Online option to enable
   player ranking.

3. In the ZoneStats Password box, enter your password.

4. In the Scoreboard for MechWarrior: Vengeance, click View ZoneStats to go
   directly to specific player statistics from within the game. This button is
   only active if you've entered a password in the ZoneStats Password box on the
   Multiplayer Options screen.

All game types except Steal the Beacon and Escort can have stats tracked by
MechWarrior: Vengeance on http://stats.zone.com/.

I. 3D Card Drivers and Manufacturers
------------------------------------

Make sure that you have the latest drivers from the manufacturer of your video
card. Many video issues will be resolved if you install your video card's latest
drivers. MechWarrior: Vengeance may not detect some older video cards properly
because their video drivers are not DirectX 8-compliant. Please contact your
video card manufacturer for updated drivers or install the latest reference
drivers for your video board. Note that many reference drivers are not supported
by the chipset manufacturer. Listed below are some common video card
manufacturers' Web sites. MechWarrior: Vengeance may not support some or all of
the cards produced by a particular manufacturer.
