TITLE   :Device Settings in Printer Properties Will Reset to Default
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Device settings in printer properties on the print server will be reset to
default when viewed by the client.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, avoid having different languages on the server and
the clients. If this is not practical, the Rasddui.dll and Rasddui.hlp file from
the server may be used on the client (in the
%systemroot%\system32\spool\drivers\w32x86\2 directory for Windows NT 4.0).
Mixing different language versions is not recommended by Microsoft, but, for
Windows NT 4.0, this may be the only working workaround.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If Windows NT Server and a Windows NT Workstation are used in different
languages, device settings in the printer properties are reset to default only
by opening the printer properties on the client (even without changing any
settings). For this to happen, the user must have the right to change printer
settings, for example to be able to change the needed paper forms.
