SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use the ListNum field anywhere in a Word
paragraph. ListNum fields can be incorporated into numbering from a simple or
outline-numbered list.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Word 97 for Windows provides a new field for numbering items in a
paragraph or for using multiple numbers on the same line of text.

Syntax
------

The syntax of the ListNum field is

   ListNum "Name" [Switches]

where "Name" lets you associate ListNum with a specific multilevel list.

Switches:

   \L  specifies the level in the list.
   \s  specifies the start-at value for the list.

NOTE: There is no way to change the format of the number (or letter) inserted by
the field directly. However you can use the CHARFORMAT switch to change the
format. For more information about Charformat, click Contents And Index on the
Help menu, click the Find tab in Word Help, type the following text:

   Charformat

and then click the Display button. If you are unable to find the information you
need, ask the Office Assistant.

There are three built-in list definitions: NumberDefault, OutlineDefault, and
LegalDefault. Each of these lists has a format automatically applied to each
level. The following table lists the default formats for each list type.

      Level   NumberDefault      OutlineDefault     LegalDefault
---------------------------------------------------------------------

        1         1)                I.                 1.
        2         a)                A.                 1.1.
        3         i)                1.                 1.1.1.
        4        (1)                a)                 1.1.1.1.
        5        (a)               (1)                 1.1.1.1.1.
        6        (i)               (a)                 1.1.1.1.1.1.
        7         1.               (i)                 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.
        8         a.               (a)                 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.
        9         i.               (i)                 1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.

If you don't specify a built-in list, Word 97 either links ListNum to the last
list in the document or defaults to the NumberDefault list.

Changing the Value of the ListNum Result
----------------------------------------

To change the value of the ListNum result, you change the list level. There are
two methods you can use to accomplish this.

Method 1: Use the Increase Indent Button:

After inserting the ListNum field, select the result and click the Increase
Indent or Decrease Indent button to toggle through the list of choices. This
will change the level specified by the \L switch, and will apply the appropriate
format.

Method 2: Edit the ListNum Field:

After you insert the ListNum field, press ALT+F9 to display the field codes.
Change the ListNum field to reflect the desired numbering style.

For example, if you want a number list to have the format of

   (a)
   (b)
   (c)

then each ListNum field in the list would resemble the following:

   {ListNum "NumberDefault" \L 5}

Inserting a ListNum Field
-------------------------

1. On the Insert menu, click Field.

2. In the Field dialog box, under Field Names, select ListNum. To add options
   (switches) to the ListNum field, click the Options button and use the "Add to
   Field" button to add the appropriate options to the ListNum field.

NOTE: A ListNum field that occurs within a paragraph, but not at the start of the
paragraph, is assumed to be one level deeper than the number at the start of the
paragraph.

For more information about the ListNum field, click Contents And Index on the
Help menu, click the Index tab in Help Topics: Microsoft Word, type the
following text

   ListNum

and then double-click the selected text to go to the "LISTNUM field" topic. If
you are unable to find the information you need, ask the Office Assistant.
