MORE INFORMATION
================

One of the most important steps in upgrading any application is to create an
upgrade plan that addresses the issues you will encounter, such as timing the
upgrade, testing the application, and training users. A well thought-out upgrade
plan is key to successful deployment. For information about common
considerations when you install or upgrade a run-time application, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q162584 ADT/ODE: Developing a Plan to Deploy Run-Time Applications


The following sections present suggestions for upgrading and redistributing
run-time applications using the Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools
(ODE).

UPGRADING AN APPLICATION THAT USES SPLIT DATABASE DESIGN
--------------------------------------------------------

This section suggests a method for upgrading your split database application. A
split database is one where you store the data (tables and relationships) in one
database on a file server computer, and the rest of the application (queries,
forms, reports, macros and modules) in another database on each user's hard
disk.

When your application uses split database design, you have the flexibility of
upgrading users over a period of time instead of all at once; you can mix
multiple versions of Microsoft Access in the application database (front end)
without having to convert the data database (back end). Because you can mix
Microsoft Access versions in the application database, this design also lends
itself well to pilot testing and stress testing of your upgrade in a production
environment.

When you are ready to upgrade a split database application, use the steps in the
following sections.

Convert and Distribute the Application Database
-----------------------------------------------

1. Obtain a recent backup copy of both the application and data databases.

   This ensures that the databases you convert will most closely emulate the
   production environment.

2. Convert the application database to Microsoft Access 97 and resolve any
   issues that arise when you convert the database. Make necessary design
   changes to the objects in the database. Leave the data database unconverted
   for now.

3. Test the features of the converted application database, and make necessary
   changes to the database design. Also create and test your Setup program with
   the ODE Setup Wizard to be sure it works correctly; if possible, you should
   run the Setup program on a computer that has your application's earlier
   version already installed.

4. Run the ODE Setup Wizard to create the setup files for your run-time
   application. Add the converted application database to your setup, and set it
   as your application's main file. Add any other support files you need to
   include with your setup. Do not include the data database in these setup
   files.

   When you create your setup with the Setup Wizard, pay careful attention to the
   Overwrite Existing File box in the Add The Files screen of the Setup Wizard.
   Remember that you will run this Setup program on a computer that already has
   an earlier version of your application; set the options in the Overwrite
   Existing File box accordingly.

5. Distribute the upgraded application for pilot testing and stress testing as
   determined by your upgrade plan. You may choose to conduct these tests in a
   production environment.

6. Distribute the upgraded application to your users. You can distribute the
   application to all users at once or you can distribute it to a few people at
   a time.

Convert the Data Database
-------------------------

1. While users are upgrading to the new version of the application database, try
   converting a copy of the data database in Microsoft Access 97. Carefully
   document any changes you make to the design of the tables in your database.

2. After all users have upgraded to the new version of the application database,
   you can convert the data database in the full version of Microsoft Access 97.
   Always create a backup of the database before you convert it. There are
   several ways you can convert the data database:

    - If the data database was converted easily and did not require modification
      when you tested it, you can instruct an administrator or a user to type a
      command line to convert the data database.

      If your application uses security, the user who converts the database must
      have permission in Microsoft Access to open the database exclusively, and
      all users must quit the program before you can convert the data database.
      Also, the user who converts the database must have permission on the
      network to create a new file in the folder on the network server that
      contains the data database.

      Use a command line similar to the following sample to convert a data
      database in Microsoft Access 97. The underscore (_) at the end of the line
      is used as a line-continuation character. Remove the underscore when you
      type the command, and type the entire command on a single line:

   C:\MyApp\Msaccess.exe /runtime \\MyServer\MyFolder\Data.mdb _
             /convert \\MyServer\MyFolder\Data97.mdb

      In this example, Data.mdb is the database you are converting and Data97.mdb
      is the name of the new database after conversion. After the data database
      is successfully converted, rename Data.mdb to Data.old, and then rename
      Data97.mdb to Data.mdb.

    - You can convert a copy of the data database directly in a full version of
      Microsoft Access 97. If you convert the database this way, you must
      prevent users from changing data in your application until you finish
      converting the data database. One way to ensure that users cannot change
      data is to set the read-only attribute of the data database file. Convert
      a copy of the data database and use it to replace the copy on the file
      server. You must remove the read- only attribute on the unconverted
      database before you can replace it.

    - You can convert a copy of the data database and create setup files for it
      using the ODE Setup Wizard. Obtain a copy of the database and ensure that
      users will not change any data in the application while you convert it.
      Then use the Setup Wizard to create setup files for the converted data
      database only, and reinstall it on the network server. Be sure to set the
      Overwrite Existing File box in the Add The Files screen of the Setup
      Wizard to Older or Always for your data database file so it replaces the
      older version when you install it.

UPGRADING AN APPLICATION THAT USES SINGLE DATABASE DESIGN
---------------------------------------------------------

In single database design, all database objects are stored in the same database
file. If your application uses single database design, you may encounter some
challenges timing and delivering the upgrade. In order to preserve the existing
data in the application, you must include a current copy of the database with
your setup files. That means you must establish a cut-off date when users will
stop using the application, arrange to receive a backup copy of the live
database, and then distribute the upgrade to all users before they can begin to
use the application again.

Follow these suggestions to minimize disruption to users when you are ready to
convert a database that contains all of your application's data:

1. Obtain a recent backup copy of the application's database so you can convert
   a database that closely matches the data you will ultimately use.

2. Convert the backup copy of the database in Microsoft Access 97 and resolve
   any issues that arise when you convert the database. Make necessary design
   changes to the query, form report, macro and module objects in the database.
   If you make any changes to the design of your tables, which is rarely
   necessary, be sure to carefully document the changes.

3. Test the features of the converted database and make more changes to the
   design of the database if necessary. Also, create and test your Setup program
   to be sure it works correctly; if possible, you should test the Setup program
   on a computer that has your application's earlier version already installed.

4. When you are ready to distribute the upgrade, arrange for users to stop using
   the application, and then obtain a backup of the most recent copy of the
   production database.

5. Delete the data from all the tables in the database you converted and tested,
   and then append the data from the most recent backup of the unconverted
   database. You can link to the tables in the unconverted database, and then
   use append queries to append the data to the tables in the converted
   database. When you perform this step, consider the following:

    - Referential integrity rules in the database may require you to delete or
      append the table data in a particular order. You may even have to
      temporarily remove some of the table relationships, and then restore them
      after you have appended the data.

    - If you made changes to the design of your tables in the converted
      database, determine if those changes will affect the data you are
      importing and take the necessary steps to import the data correctly.

   When you are finished with this step, the data in the converted database will
   match the data in the most recent backup. The converted database now becomes
   the production database.

6. Create a backup copy of the converted database as soon as you have
   successfully appended all of the data.

7. Run the ODE Setup Wizard to create the setup files for your run-time
   application. Be sure to use the converted database with current data as your
   application's main file. When you create your setup files, pay careful
   attention to the Overwrite Existing File box in the Add The Files screen of
   the Setup Wizard. Remember that you will run this Setup program on a computer
   that already has an earlier version of your application; set the options in
   the Overwrite Existing File box accordingly.

8. Use the Setup program to distribute your upgrade, and then instruct users to
   begin using the application again.

UPGRADING A SECURE APPLICATION
------------------------------

If your run-time application uses Microsoft Access user-level security, you must
decide whether to include an upgraded workgroup information file (System.mdw or
System.mda) when you distribute your upgraded application. The workgroup
information file contains all of the user and group account information that
your application uses to implement security.

As with any Microsoft Access database, after you create the workgroup information
file in Microsoft Access 97 it will be inaccessible to users of earlier
Microsoft Access versions. If your users will be running mixed versions of
Microsoft Access, you must leave the workgroup information file in the earliest
version of Microsoft Access that any user has. For example, as long as one user
of your application is using Microsoft Access 2.0, the workgroup information
file must remain a version 2.0 file.

If all users are upgrading to a Microsoft Access 97 run-time application at the
same time, the decision whether to upgrade the workgroup information file
depends on the Microsoft Access version of that file.

If your workgroup information file is a Microsoft Access 1.x or 2.0 file,
re-create the workgroup information file in Microsoft Access 97 to take
advantage of new security and performance features. For more information about
converting a workgroup information file, search the Microsoft Access 97 Help
Index for "converting workgroup information files."

If your workgroup information file is a Microsoft Access 7.0 file, you do not
need to convert it when you convert your application in Microsoft Access 97.
However, you should compact the workgroup information file in Microsoft Access
97 before you redistribute it. For more information about how to compact the
workgroup information file, search the Microsoft Access 97 Help Index for
"converting databases," and then "Convert a secured database from a previous
version of Microsoft Access." Scroll to the bottom of the topic and click the
link called "Convert a Microsoft Access 95 secured database when all users are
upgrading to Microsoft Access 97."

UPGRADING A REPLICATED APPLICATION
----------------------------------

You must exercise some caution when you upgrade a replicated application. All it
takes to convert a replica database to a Microsoft Access 97 database is to
synchronize with a Microsoft Access 97 Design Master. For this reason, if one
user in a replica set upgrades to Microsoft Access 97, all users in a replica
set must upgrade also.

When you want to test conversion on a replicated application, be sure to make a
copy of the Design Master database and test conversion on the copy. That way you
minimize the risk of accidentally upgrading other members in the replica set by
synchronizing with them.

For more information about a converting a replica set in Microsoft Access 97,
search the Help Index for "converting replicas."

UPGRADING AN APPLICATION IN A MIXED VERSION ENVIRONMENT
-------------------------------------------------------

Often you cannot upgrade all users to the latest version of Microsoft Access at
the same time. Sometimes the issue is timing, and you are unable to upgrade all
users at the same time. Sometimes the issue is hardware or software, and one or
more users do not have the system requirements to run Microsoft Access 97.

Whatever the reason for the mixed environment, your application must use a split
database design if you plan to support multiple users in more than one version
of Microsoft Access at a time. With split database design, the application
database that resides on each user's hard disk can be a Microsoft Access 2.0,
7.0, or 97 database. The data database that resides on the network file server
must remain in the earliest version of Microsoft Access that any user has. For
example, if you have only one user with a Microsoft Access 2.0 application
database, the data database must remain a version 2.0 database.
