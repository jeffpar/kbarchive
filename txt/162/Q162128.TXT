Clip Gallery Cannot Open Previews File
--------------------------------------

You may receive the following error message when a Clip Gallery database (.cag)
file has been moved, deleted, or is no longer accessible:

   Cannot Open Previews File.

   Clip Gallery cannot open the previews file C:\Art Files \Clip Art\My Art.cag.

   That file may have been deleted or moved. If you moved that file choose Import
   Clips, then select the file at its new location. This will re-import the
   clips in that previews file.

NOTE: The dialog box contains a "Don't attempt to open that file in the future"
check box. If you click to select the check box and then click OK, that database
and its associated thumbnail images are permanently removed from Clip Gallery.
The associated picture file is not deleted because the .cag file contains a
pointer to the file and not the actual picture itself.

Clip Gallery may be unable to open the previews file for any of the following
reasons:

 - Office is a shared install running from a NetWare server.

 - The .cag file has been moved or is missing.

 - The .cag file is corrupted.

 - There is a problem with the operating system.

If the following troubleshooting steps do not fix the problem, you may be
experiencing problems with your computer hardware or operating system.

Office Is a Shared Install Running from a NetWare Server:

Scenario: Two people have write privileges on the NewWare Server. Both are
attempting to use the Clip Gallery files at the same time. For Example,
Administrator A opens the Clip Gallery. Before Administrator A has finished,
Administrator B opens the Clip Gallery. Administrator B will receive a series of
error messages for .cag files because Administrator A already has Read/Write
control of them.

To correct this problem, make sure that users have Read Only privileges or that
only one person with Read/Write access is using the Gallery at any one time.

Multiple users with Read-Only privileges do not receive the error.

The .cag File Has Been Moved or Is Missing:

To determine if the .cag file is missing, follow these steps :

1. Look for the .cag file on your computer. Use the Find feature to search for
   the .cag file. To do this, follow these steps:

   
   a. In Windows 95/98 and Windows NT 4, click the Windows Start menu, point to
      Find, and then click Files Or Folders to open the Find All Files dialog
      box.

      In Windows 2000, click the Start menu, point to Search, and then click For
      Files Or Folders to open the Search Results dialog box.

   b. In the Named box on Windows 95/98 and Windows NT 4, type the name of the
      missing .cag file.

      In the Search for files or folders named box on Windows 2000, type the name
      of the missing .cag file.

   c. In Windows 95/98 and Windows NT 4, click Find Now to start the search.

      In Windows 2000, click Search Now to start the search.

2. If you have located the .cag file, verify if its associated image files are
   in the same folder with it. If they are, proceed to step 5.

   If the .cag file is not present on the hard disk and it is one that you
   created, you must recreate it. If it is not one that you created, proceed to
   step 3. For additional information on recreating .cag files, please see the
   following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q161718 CG3: Creating Clip Gallery Packages

3. Copy the .cag file from the compact disc to the appropriate ClipArt folder.
   If the file came from Publisher 97 or from another Microsoft program, the
   location may be the following:

   C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Artgalry\My Art\

4. Check to make sure that the images from the .cag file can be opened in
   WordPad.

   
   a. On the Windows Start menu, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and
      click WordPad.

   b. On the Insert menu, click Object, and then click Microsoft Clip Gallery.
      Click OK.

   If you do not receive an error message and Clip Gallery opens normally,
   confirm whether you can open the images from that .cag file in WordPad. If
   you cannot open them, see the "Clip Gallery Cannot Find A Clip File" section
   of this article.

5. If the .cag file and its associated image files are in the same location and
   that location is not where they were originally installed, you can either
   link to the new location or you can move the files to the original location.
   After you link to the files or move them, follow steps 3 and 4 in this ("Clip
   Gallery Cannot Open Previews File") section as needed. Otherwise, continue
   with step 6.

6. To link to the new location, start Publisher. On the Insert menu, click Clip
   Art.

7. The "Clip Gallery cannot open the Previews file" dialog box is displayed once
   for each missing .cag file.

   Click to select the "Don't attempt to open that file in the future" check box,
   and click OK.

8. Click Import Clips.

9. In the Look In list, click the location of the .cag file and its associated
   image files. Change the file type to Clip Gallery Packages.

10. Click the .cag file that is listed. Click Open. When you are prompted to
   restart Clip Gallery, click OK. If you want to link to other .cag files,
   repeat steps 9 and 10 as needed.

11. After you have linked all the .cag files, close Clip Gallery and restart it.
   Your images should now be available.

The .cag File Is Corrupted:

If the .cag file is not missing and is in the correct location, it may be
corrupted.

1. Locate the .cag file referenced in the error message.

2. After you find the .cag file, rename it.

3. If the .cag file came from Publisher 97, Office 97, or PowerPoint 97, copy
   the original .cag file from the ClipArt folder on the compact disc to the
   folder where the renamed file is located.

4. On the Windows Start menu, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and click
   WordPad.

5. On the Insert menu, click Object, and then click Microsoft Clip Gallery.
   Click OK.

   If the problem was a corrupted .cag file, Clip Gallery will start
   successfully.

   However, if the .cag file in question is supposed to be on the compact disc,
   you may be experiencing a problem with your CD-ROM drive, or the compact disc
   may be dirty or damaged.

   To check for physical damage to the compact disc, follow these steps:

   
   a. Remove the compact disc from the CD-ROM drive, and check the bottom of the
      disc for defects or scratches.

   b. If it is smudged or dirty, clean it with a soft, lint-free cloth.

   c. After you have cleaned the compact disc, put it back in the CD-ROM drive
      and try to run Clip Gallery again. If it runs successfully, then the
      compact disc was merely dirty.

Clip Gallery Cannot Find a Clip File
------------------------------------

If you choose a preview image in Clip Gallery you receive the following error
message:

   Cannot Find "<path>\<Clip filename>".

When you click OK, the Cannot Insert Picture dialog box appears showing the
following message:

   The Clip Gallery cannot find this clip file on your disk. If you've deleted
   this file and you want to remove its preview from the Clip Gallery, choose
   Remove Preview.

   If you've deleted or moved many clip files from your disk, choose Update All
   to have Clip Gallery remove or update the previews of all missing files.

If you click Remove Preview, Clip Gallery simply removes the preview image from
its Clip Art Gallery database. If you click Update All, the Update dialog box
appears showing the following message:

   Click Update All to correct previews for previews for clip files that have
   been deleted, moved, or changed.

   To add previews of other clip files to the Clip Gallery, click Cancel, and
   then click Import Clips.

This dialog box has an "Also correct previews on" check box for network drives
and another check box for removable disks.

If you click Cancel, you are then returned to Clip Gallery.

If you click Update All, follow the instructions to locate the missing images. If
you do not click to select the check box for either Network drives or Removable
disks, Clip Gallery will not check the clip files on either location.

Can't Open Log File:

When you choose to import a clip file in the Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM)
format, you may receive the following error message:

   Can't open log file.

If you click OK, the image is still imported.

You will receive this error message in only two situations:

 - The Cgmerrs.log file is set to read-only.

   -or-

 - The Cgmerrs.log file is corrupted.

If the Cgmerrs.log file is not marked as Read Only, then delete the file. The CGM
import filter will create a new one.

This file, although not a critical one, is used by the CGM import filter to track
errors that occur during a file import. This means that you must be able to
write to the Cgmerrs.log file. The default location is the same folder as the
Cgmimp32.flt file. If the file is on a network server in a shared folder, the
\Msapps\Grphflt folder must have the read/write property set for all users who
install Clip Gallery.
