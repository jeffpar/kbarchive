TITLE   :WD97: Print To File on Windows May Produce Incorrect Output
PRODUCT :Word 97 for Windows
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:97
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint winword word97

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print to a file using the Generic/Text Only printer driver in Microsoft
Windows NT version 4.0 or Microsoft Windows 95, the resulting .prn file will
contain garbled text. When you view the .prn file in a text editor, all of the
characters are formatted incorrectly.


CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the text is formatted at 10 characters per inch, in a
font other than the Generic/Text Only printer font (Roman), and when the default
data type of the printer driver is not text.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods.

Method 1: Change the Printer Metrics to Lay Out the Document
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Start Microsoft Word and open the document that you want to print to a file.

2. On the Tools menu, click Options.

3. On the Compatibility tab, click to select Microsoft Word 97 in the
   Recommended Options For box.

4. On the Compatibility tab, under Options, select the "Use printer metrics to
   lay out document" check box, and then click OK.

NOTE: When you select the "Use printer metrics to lay out document" check box,
the Recommended Options For box changes to Custom. This method applies only to
the current document, because "Use printer metrics to lay out document" is a
document setting only.

Method 2: Set a Printer Driver and Font Selection (Windows NT 4.0 Only)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Click to select the Generic Text only printer driver icon. If this icon does
   not appear, see the "Installing the Generic / Text Only Printer" section
   later in this article.

3. On the File menu, click Properties, and then on the General tab, click Print
   Processor.

4. In the Default Datatype box, click Text, and then click OK.

5. Start Microsoft Word and open the document that you want to print to a file.

6. On the Edit menu, click Select All.

7. On the Format menu, click Font. On the Font tab, click Roman (10 characters
   per inch) in the Font list.

8. In the Size list, click 10, and then click OK.

9. On the File menu, click Print. Under Printer, select the Print To File check
   box, and then click OK.

Installing the Generic / Text Only Printer
------------------------------------------

To install the Generic / Text Only printer for method 2, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Double-click Add Printer, and then click Next.

3. Click Local Printer or Network Printer as appropriate, and then click Next.

   If you click Network Printer, you are prompted for the network path for the
   printer. If you do not know the correct path, click Browse, or check with
   your network administrator. Click either Yes or No in the "Do you print from
   MS-DOS-based programs?" area, and then click Next.

4. Under Manufacturers, click Generic. Under Model, click Generic / Text Only,
   and then click Next.

5. If you chose to install a local printer, click the correct port and then
   click Next.

6. Type a name for the printer (or accept the default name), and then click
   either Yes or No in the "Do you want your Windows-based programs to use this
   printer as the default printer?" area. Click Next.

7. To print a test page, click Yes. Click Finish.
