TITLE   :BUG: All Characters Following CHR(0) are Ignored with MSComm
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER:5.0 5.0a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbcode kbinterop kbvfp kbvfp500

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an instance of the Microsoft Communication Control (MSComm Control)
receives a CHR(0) it ignores that character and all characters that follow.

RESOLUTION
==========

One of the following suggestions should resolve this problem:

 - Set the InputLen property of the Microsoft Communication Control to 1 and
   read one character at a time.

 - If possible, do not send CHR(0) or NULL to the Microsoft Communication
   control.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This has been corrected in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Communication Control truncates all characters following, and
including, a CHR(0) or NULL that is passed to its Input. This occurs when the
"NullDiscard" of the Microsoft Communication control set to ".F."

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Connect two computers via a NULL Modem cable. For example, COM1 port of a
   computer (PC1) connected to the COM1 port of another computer (PC2) via a
   Null Modem Cable.

2. On PC1, place the following commands into a Visual FoxPro program and then
   execute it, to create and run a form that sends serial output using the MS
   Communication Control:

   

          OUTFORM = CreateObject("comtst1")
          OUTFORM.Show
          READ EVENTS

          DEFINE CLASS COMTST1 AS FORM
            Top = 7
            Left = 88
            Height = 239
            Width = 288
            DOCREATE = .T.
            Caption = "Form1"
            Name = "Form1"
            OUTVAL = .F.
            ADD OBJECT TEXT1 AS TEXTBOX WITH ;
               HEIGHT = 37, ;
               LEFT = 29, ;
               TOP = 84, ;
               WIDTH = 229, ;
               Name = "Text1"
            ADD OBJECT Olecontrol1 AS Olecontrol WITH ;
               OLECLASS="MSCOMMLib.MSComm.1",;
               TOP = 12, ;
               LEFT = 0, ;
               HEIGHT = 100, ;
               WIDTH = 100, ;
               NULLDISCARD = .F., ;
               Name = "Olecontrol1"
            ADD OBJECT Command1 AS CommandBUTTON WITH ;
               TOP = 37, ;
               LEFT = 104, ;
               HEIGHT = 27, ;
               WIDTH = 84, ;
               CAPTION = "Open Port", ;
               TABINDEX = 2, ;
               Name = "Command1"
            ADD OBJECT Command2 AS CommandBUTTON WITH ;
               TOP = 133, ;
               LEFT = 104, ;
               HEIGHT = 27, ;
               WIDTH = 84, ;
               CAPTION = "Send", ;
               Name = "Command2"
            ADD OBJECT Command3 AS CommandBUTTON WITH ;
               TOP = 193, ;
               LEFT = 104, ;
               HEIGHT = 27, ;
               WIDTH = 84, ;
               CAPTION = "Exit", ;
               Name = "Command3"

            PROCEDURE Command1.Click
               IF This.CAPTION="Open Port"
                  ThisForm.Olecontrol1.PORTOPEN=.T.
                  This.Caption = "Close Port"
               Else
                  ThisForm.Olecontrol1.PORTOPEN=.F.
                  This.Caption = "Open Port"
               EndIf
            ENDPROC

            PROCEDURE Command2.Click
               *** Send CHR() representation of numbers entered ***
               OVAL1 = ALLTRIM(ThisForm.TEXT1.Value)
               OVAL2 = "chr(" + STRTRAN(OVAL1, " ", ")+chr(") + ")"
               ThisForm.Olecontrol1.OUTPUT=&OVAL2
            ENDPROC

            PROCEDURE Command3.Click
               ThisForm.Release
               CLEAR EVENTS
            ENDPROC

          ENDDEFINE

3. Switch to PC2 and place the following code into a Visual FoxPro program and
   execute it to create and run a form that receives serial input using the MS
   Communication Control:

   

          INFORM = CREATEOBJECT("comtst2")
          INFORM.SHOW
          READ EVENTS

          DEFINE CLASS comtst2 AS FORM
              Top = 5
              Left = 1
              Height = 216
              Width = 410
              DoCreate = .T.
              Caption = "Form1"
              Name = "Form1"
              inval1 = .F.
              inval2 = .F.
              ADD OBJECT Olecontrol1 AS OleCONTROL WITH ;
                  OleCLASS="MSCOMMLib.MSComm.1",;
                  TOP = 12, ;
                  LEFT = 12, ;
                  HEIGHT = 100, ;
                  WIDTH = 100, ;
                  NAME = "Olecontrol1", ;
                  NullDiscard = .F., ;
                  RThreshold = 10
              ADD OBJECT Command1 AS CommandBUTTON WITH ;
                  TOP = 24, ;
                  LEFT = 150, ;
                  HEIGHT = 27, ;
                  WIDTH = 84, ;
                  CAPTION = "Open Port", ;
                  NAME = "Command1"
              ADD OBJECT Edit1 AS EditBOX WITH ;

                  NAME = "Edit1"
              ADD OBJECT Command2 AS CommandBUTTON WITH ;
                  TOP = 108, ;
                  LEFT = 298, ;
                  HEIGHT = 27, ;
                  WIDTH = 84, ;
                  CAPTION = "Clear Text", ;

                  ENABLED = .F., ;
                  NAME = "Command3"
              ADD OBJECT Command4 AS CommandBUTTON WITH ;
                  TOP = 178, ;
                  LEFT = 150, ;
                  HEIGHT = 27, ;
                  WIDTH = 84, ;
                  CAPTION = "Exit", ;
                  NAME = "Command4"

              PROCEDURE Command1.CLICK
                  IF This.CAPTION="Open Port"
                      ThisForm.Olecontrol1.portopen=.T.

              ENDPROC

              PROCEDURE Command2.CLICK
                  ThisForm.Edit1.VALUE = ""
              ENDPROC

              PROCEDURE Command3.CLICK
                  ThisForm.inval1 = ThisForm.Olecontrol1.INPUT
                  FOR i = 1 TO LEN(ThisForm.inval1)

                      ThisForm.Edit1.VALUE=ThisForm.Edit1.VALUE+;
                              " "+ALLTRIM(STR(ThisForm.inval2))+" "
                  ENDFOR
              ENDPROC

              PROCEDURE Command4.CLICK
                  ThisForm.RELEASE
                  CLEAR EVENTS
              ENDPROC

          ENDDEFINE

4. Click Open Port on the InForm form on PC2 to open the communication port on
   that computer.

5. Switch to PC1 and click Open Port on the OutForm form on PC1 to open the
   communication port on that computer.

6. Select the edit box on OutForm and enter the following numbers into the first
   line:

   

         15 255 13 10 25

   NOTE: Ensure that the numbers are entered with a space between them but with
   no space before the first (15) and after the last number (25).

7. Click SEND on OutForm to send the numbers.

8. Switch to PC2 and click View Input on InForm. Look at the contents of the
   edit box.

   NOTE: The characters sent by OutForm are displayed in the edit box of InForm.
   So, the characters are being received and recognized by MS Communication
   Control on the receiving end.

9. Click Clear Text to clear the edit box.

10. Go back to PC1 and insert a "0" between the second and third number in the
   edit box of OutForm so that the entries look like the following:

   

          15 255 0 13 10 25

11. Click SEND on OutForm to send the numbers.

12. Switch to PC1 and click View Input. Look at the contents of the edit box.

   NOTE: Only the first and the second numbers (15 255), sent by OutForm on PC1,
   are displayed in the edit box of InForm. The "0" and the numbers following
   it are not displayed. This illustrates that after a receiving CHR(0) or NULL
   that the MS Communication Control ignores that particular character and all
   characters following it.
