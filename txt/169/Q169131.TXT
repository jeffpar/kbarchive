TITLE   :Print Setup Dialog Box May Take a Long Time to Display
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER::4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbprint kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Applications that use the print setup common dialog take a long time, 40 to 60
seconds, to display the print setup dialog box. This delay only occurs when the
default printer name is longer than 32 characters.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when an application uses the common dialog (Comdlg32.dll)
routine for print setup (PrintDlg) and specifies a truncated default print queue
name. Because the truncated print queue name does not really exist on the target
print server, Windows NT attempts to reach the print queue over every installed
network redirector until they all timeout (usually 40 to 60 seconds). After all
attempts have timed out in the redirectors, Comdlg32.dll assumes the print queue
name was specified incorrectly and substitutes the default print queue port
name, which is never truncated.

MORE INFORMATION
================

PrintDlg can be called in two distinct modes:

 - To retrieve the current default print queue information.

 - To open the print settings dialog optionally specifying the default printer
   name.

If an application uses PrintDlg to retrieve the default print queue name and the
default printer name is longer than 32 characters, the name will be truncated.

For example, a 34 character print queue name such as

   \\Red_dog\pq-mc0838-hplj4sib-3-081

would be truncated to 31 characters such as

   \\Red_dog\pq-mc0838-hplj4sib-3-

Truncation of long print queue names occurs because the print queue name variable
in Comdlg32.dll is limited to 32 characters in length. This limitation has it's
roots in the Windows 3.x products where the maximum length for a device name was
32 characters and is documented in the Win32 SDK (Software Development Kit).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
