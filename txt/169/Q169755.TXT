SUMMARY
=======

To troubleshoot fax problems that occur when you use Microsoft Fax to send a fax
from Word, use the methods described in the "More Information" section of this
article.

NOTE: Third-party faxing software is available for use with Microsoft Word;
however, Microsoft Technical Support can only support faxing from Word when
using Microsoft Fax.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To fully test your system's ability to communicate and function correctly with
your modem and Microsoft Fax, perform the steps in the order in which they are
listed here.

Step 1: Test Windows Communications with Your Modem
---------------------------------------------------

To test whether Windows can communicate with your modem, follow these steps:

   Microsoft Windows 95 and Microsoft Windows 98

1. On the Windows Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Modems icon.

3. Click the Diagnostics tab, click the port at which you have your modem
   installed, and then click More Info. Windows will now attempt to communicate
   with your modem. Windows should display the following message:

   Communicating with modem. This may take a few minutes.

   Windows will send several "AT" commands to your modem. If these tests are
   successful, Windows will display the Port Information and "AT" responses for
   each command.

   Microsoft Windows 2000

1. On the Windows Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Phone and Modem Options icon.

3. Click the Modems tab, click the port at which you have your modem installed,
   and then click Properties.

4. In the Modemname dialog box, click the Diagnostics tab. Click Query Modem.
   Windows now attempts to communicate with your modem. Windows should display
   the following message:

   Communicating with modem. This may take a few minutes.

   Windows sends several "AT" commands to your modem. If these tests are
   successful, Windows displays the Port Information and "AT" responses for each
   command.

If the tests are successful, proceed to step 2.

If any of the following problems occur, you may have either a modem, modem
configuration, or modem connection problem. If this is the case, refer to the
additional information articles at the end of this section.

Problems that may occur when you run the test:

 - The COM port for your modem may not be listed as an available port.

   -or-

 - You receive any of the following error messages:

   The modem failed to respond. Make sure it is properly connected and turned
   on. If it is an internal modem or is connected, verify that the interrupt for
   the port is properly set.

   -or-

   The COM<x> port is currently assigned to an MS-DOS application. Do you
   want to reassign the port to Windows?

   -or-

   Another program is using the selected Telephony device. Try again after the
   other program completes.

   -or-

   You receive a "disk full" error. The hard disk partition containing your
   temporary fax folder is low on storage space. For information on cleaning out
   this folder, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge

Step 2: Test the Send Functionality of Microsoft Fax
----------------------------------------------------

To check the send functionality of Microsoft Fax, use the following steps:

1. On the Windows Start menu, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to
   Fax, and then click Compose New Fax. The Compose New Fax wizard should start.

2. Click Next.

   NOTE: Click Dialing Properties to change dialing information, if needed.

3. Type in the addressee in the To line, and then type in the fax number of a
   fax machine you can send a test fax to. Click Add To List, and then click
   Next.

4. For your test, click No to the question "Do you want a cover page?" Click
   Options. Under the Time To Send section, click "As soon as Possible," click
   OK, and then click Next.

5. Type in a Subject and a short Note, and then click Next.

6. On the Files To Send dialog box, click Next.

7. In the "Your Fax is now ready. To send it, click Finish" dialog box, click
   Finish.

Microsoft Fax will send your test document. A Microsoft Fax dialog box should
appear on your screen. There will be several messages indicating the progress of
the test. The messages you should see are similar to the following:

 - Processing new fax message
 - Preparing email format
 - Email format created
 - Calling <recipient>

If these steps are successful, proceed to step 3.

If either of the following problems occur, see the articles at the end of this
section.

Problems that may occur when you follow the steps:

 - You receive the following error message:

   The following unrecoverable error has occurred: Internal MAPI error: The
   information service cannot be added to the profile using the Inbox Setup
   Wizard. Contact your administrator.

 - The Fax command is not available on the Accessories menu.

You may have either a modem, modem configuration, modem connection, fax service,
or profile problem. In order to correct this problem, repeat step 1 in this
section, remove and reinstall Microsoft Fax, add Microsoft Fax to your profile,
or reinstall Microsoft Windows 95 with Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Fax
selected.

For more information about how to perform this task in Windows 95, see your
Windows 95 printed documentation, online Help, or call Microsoft Windows 95

Step 3: Test the Rendering System of Microsoft Fax from Word
------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Make sure that the Mail As Attachment option is turned off in Word. To turn
the Mail As Attachment option off, click to clear the Mail As Attachment check
box on the General tab. To view the General tab, click Options on the Tools
menu.

To test whether Microsoft Fax can render a Word document for faxing, follow these
steps:

1. Create a document in Word. On the File menu, point to Send, and then click
   Mail Recipient.

   NOTE: If Send is not available on the File menu, you must install Microsoft
   Exchange using Windows 95 Setup.

2. In the New Message dialog box, the Word document will appear as text and the
   insertion point should be blinking in the To line.

   NOTE: To send your Word document as an attachment to the mail message, in
   Word, click Options on the Tools menu. On the General tab, click to select
   the Mail As Attachment check box, and then click OK.

3. In the To line, type "[fax:me]" (without the quotation marks).

4. Use one of the following methods:

Method 1: With Microsoft Outlook Installed
------------------------------------------

   a. On the File menu, click Send Options.

   b. On the Fax tab, under Message Format, click to select the Not Editable
      check box, and then click OK.

Method 2: Without Microsoft Outlook Installed
---------------------------------------------

   a. On the File menu, click Properties.

   b. On the General tab, under Message Format, click to select Not Editable and
      then click OK.

   c. Click OK.

5. On the File menu, click Send.

Word will now send your document. A Microsoft Fax dialog box should appear on
your screen. There will be several messages indicating the progress of the test.
The messages you should see are:

 - Processing new fax message.
 - Preparing fax format.
 - Scheduling fax.
 - Calling:Me.

By using the [fax:me] and the Not Editable format, you force Microsoft Fax to
render and send the fax to your inbox. If these steps are successful, proceed to
step 4 (the cause of the problem is probably an address or fax modem problem).

If any of the following problems are experienced, refer to the additional
information articles at the end of this section.

Problems you may experience when you run this test include:

 - You receive the following error message in Microsoft Exchange:

   The item's properties could not be displayed. No additional send options are
   available for this message.

 - When you click Send Options on the File menu from the test message, nothing
   happens.
 - You cannot close Microsoft Word until the Send Mail command is finished.
   Switch to the New Message first, and either send or close the message.
 - You receive a message stating that no transport provider was available for
   delivery to this recipient.
 - You receive an "Undeliverable" mail message stating "An unknown error has
   occurred. Try to send the fax again."

3. In the Print dialog box, under Printer, in the Name box, select Microsoft
