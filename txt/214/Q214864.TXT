SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4, Microsoft Exchange Internet
Applications and Services may no longer function properly and the following
errors are visible in the Event Viewer:

   EventID: 1309

   EventID: 1194
   Source: MSExchangeIS
   Description:

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 causes NDISWAN Services to return IP addresses in
the order in which they are bound. This change results in IP addresses not
currently bound to the TCP/IP stack being returned when making a call to the
Winsock API function GetHostbyName(). Microsoft Exchange Server fails to
register Internet protocols with these IP addresses.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
the individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
pack, please go to:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.
This problem was first corrected in Windows NT version 4.0 Service Pack 5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NNTP is another protocol that Exchange supports and this error can occur with
this protocol for the same reasons.

This error can also occur when certain applications are installed that overwrite
the files:

 - %windir%\system32\mfc42.dll

 - %windir%\system32\mfc42u.dll

The version stamp on these files will be 6.00.8168.0. To resolve this issue,
install SP5 or higher.
