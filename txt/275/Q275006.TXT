SUMMARY
=======

This article describes some known video-related issues that you may experience
when you play in Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following video adapters and chip sets have known video-related issues in
Combat Flight Simulator 2.

3Dfx - Voodoo and Voodoo II Chip Sets
-------------------------------------

 - When a video adapter that is based on a Voodoo or Voodoo II chip set (Diamond
   Monster I and II, Canopus Pure 3D I and II, and Creative Labs Voodoo Blaster)
   is installed in your computer, you may not be able to select the video
   adapter in Combat Flight Simulator 2.

   To resolve this issue, restart your computer.

 - If a Diamond Monster II video adapter is installed in your computer with the
   retail video driver, Combat Flight Simulator 2 may not recognize the video
   adapter.

   To resolve this issue, download and install the latest video driver for your
   video adapter from the following S3 Web site:

   http://www.s3.com

 - Voodoo I users may see a band of rectangles that briefly appear horizontally
   across the screen. This condition occurs when new textures are downloading
   and audio is playing.

   This is an issue with the video adapter and there is no known fix.

 - The color palette may be distorted or text may be unreadable.

   To resolve this issue, download and install the latest video driver for your
   video adapter.

Voodoo 5
--------

 - If you use the Tool tips feature, the frame rate may slow down by 90%.

nVidia GeForce DDR
------------------

 - Ground textures or aircraft textures may appear black or disappear.

   To attempt to resolve this issue, download and install the latest Detonator 3
   video driver for your video adapter from the following nVidia Web site:

   http://www.nvidia.com

Rush Chip Set (Hercules Stingray 128 /3D)
-----------------------------------------

 - When you quit Combat Flight Simulator 2, your computer may stop responding
   (hang).

   This behavior can occur if you are using version 4.10.1.2059 of the 3Dfx
   Voodoo Rush video driver.

   To resolve this issue, download and install the 3Dfx Voodoo Rush Reference
   Drivers for Windows 95/98 (Single Board) from the following 3Dfx Web site:

   http://www.3dfx.com

ATI Radeon 7200, ATI Radeon 64 MB DDR VIVO
------------------------------------------

Hardware Transform and Lighting (T&L) may exhibit one of the following
symptoms:

   

 - T&L may not remain functioning between CFS2 sessions.
 - T&L may only work if the feature is disabled in CFS2.
 - A change in the video resolution setting in CFS2 may cause the symptoms to
   alternate.

To resolve this behavior:

1. From the main screen, click Settings. From within the game, press and hold
   down ALT, and then from the Options menu, click Settings.

2. Click Advanced Settings.

3. Click to select the T&L option.

4. Click OK twice.

If T&L is not enabled, repeat steps 1-4 and click to clear the option.

NOTE: To ensure T&L is working, switch to the Spot Plane view (from the Views
menu, higlight New View, and then click Spot Plane). With NUM LOCK on, press the
keys on the number pad to switch views. Make sure you are viewing the side of
the aircraft that has sun shining on it. The shady side of the air raft may
appear dark as though T&L is not enabled.

   missing or distorted.

   You may be able to improve the textures by turning off MIP Mapping in Combat
   Flight Simulator 2.

   version 4.10.1637) or the Cirrus Logic video driver (546x.drv version
   4.10.01.1701), textures may be corrupt in different screen resolutions and
   color palette settings.

   To resolve this issue, download and install the latest video driver available
   for your video adapter from the manufacturer of your video adapter.
