SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to start the message transfer agent (MTA) from Control Panel /
Services, you may receive the following error message:

   Could not start the Microsoft Message Transfer Agent service on
   <servername>.
   Error 1058: The specified service is disabled and cannot be started.

You may receive this error starting any service, including the Simple Mail
Transfer Protocol(SMTP) service or any Microsoft Exchange service.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the service is disabled within the current hardware
profile.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, perform the following steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
   the Services icon.

2. Select the Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent service, and then click
   Hardware Profiles.

3. Click the current hardware profile, click Enable, and then click OK.

4. Ensure that the Startup Type for the service is set to Manual or Automatic.

5. Click Start to start the service.

The Hardware Profile Setting is designed to assist computers that have multiple
configurations. Third-party applications often disable this service to ensure
that these services do not disrupt their product. To check and correct Hardware
Profile behaviors:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
   the Services icon.

2. Click the service that is not responding, and then click Hardware Profiles.

3. Verify that the setting for the original configuration is enabled. If the
   setting for the original configuration is not enabled, double-click to change
   the setting.

NOTE: This behavior can occur for any service listed under Services in Control
Panel.
