TITLE   :XADM: How to Compare USNs for Intrasite Replication

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the procedure for determining whether an object is being
properly replicated, based on the object's update sequence number (USN). This
procedure should be used as one of the steps in verifying intrasite directory
replication.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the USN-Changed numbers are being increased above the USN of the modified or
new object, then that directory is capable of verifying changes made to its
directory entries. If you are unable to perform an Update Now, then you will be
unable to perform the USN procedure.

Procedure
---------

SERVER 1 = Problem server
SERVER 2 = A server in the site that successfully replicates

NOTE: This procedure needs to be performed in the Exchange Server Administrator
program in raw mode on any server involved.

WARNING: Using the raw mode of the Exchange Administrator program (admin /r)
incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall
Microsoft Windows NT Server and/or Microsoft Exchange Server. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of raw mode can be
solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.

 - To initialize raw mode, from the command prompt, in the EXCHSRVR\BIN
   directory, type the following:

   admin /r

1. From Server 1 and Server 2, select the configuration object and select File /
   Raw properties.

2. Write down the numbers for the following items on the two servers:

   USN-Changed
   USN-Source
   Reps-From (for the other server involved in the test. For example, if you are
   connected to Server 1, select Reps-From, select Server 2, and double-click.
   When the screen opens, click OK, and then write down the USN.)

3. Make a change to an object or create a new object while connected to Server
   1. Notice the object's USN-Changed by viewing its raw properties. This number
   should be higher than the configuration object's USN-Changed number.

4. Go to Configuration / Servers / Server 1 - Directory Service, and perform an
   Update Now (select Refresh All Items in the Directory).

5. Verify that the USN-Changed on the configuration object is now higher than
   the USN-Changed of the new or modified object mentioned in step 3. If not,
   there's a problem with the directory on Server 1.

6. Connect to Server 2 and perform an Update Now (Refresh All Items in the
   Directory). The USN-Changed on Server 2 should match USN-Source on Server 1
   (if there have been no other updates performed on Server 1).

7. The new or modified object should be viewable from Server 2, and the USN-
   Changed on Server 2 should match the USN-Source on Server 1.

8. Repeat steps 2-7 while connected to Server 2, replacing each entry of Server
   1 with Server 2.
