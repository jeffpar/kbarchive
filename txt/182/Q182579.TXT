SUMMARY
=======

This article demonstrates how to create a simple Active Document application.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "Programmer's Guide" contains good information on the background and
features of Active Documents.

The Microsoft Visual FoxPro "Programmer's Guide" defines Active Documents As
follows:

   "... a Windows-based, non-HTML application embedded in a browser, providing a
   way for the functionality of that application to be accessible from within
   the browser interface. Visual FoxPro Active Document applications are like
   any other Visual FoxPro applications in that you can run forms, reports, and
   labels, instantiate classes, run code, and manipulate data, but they have the
   added advantage of being hostable in an Active Document container, such as
   Internet Explorer."

The following are a series of steps to get a simple Active Document application
up and running in Visual FoxPro.

Steps to Create Active Document Application
-------------------------------------------

1. Create a new project and name it Adtest.pjx.

2. Select the Classes tab and click the New button to add a new class.

3. Name the new class ADTest. Make sure it is based on the ActiveDoc class,
   which should be the default. Store that new class in Adtest.vcx.

4. Once the Class Designer opens, go to the Properties sheet and select the
   Methods tab.

5. In the Run Event method code, type in the following:

         SET TALK OFF
         SET STATUS BAR OFF
         ** DO Adtest.mpr
         DO FORM Adtest.scx
         READ EVENTS

   NOTE: This code sets the Visual FoxPro Status Bar off since Internet Explorer
   already has a status bar. You do not want to have two status bars. TALK is
   set off because when the status bar is off, some FoxPro commands talk to the
   active window instead of the status bar. The command to "DO" a menu program
   is commented out since this article will not cover setting up a menu in the
   Active Document application. Please refer to the article listed in the
   REFERENCES section for information on creating a sample menu program for use
   with this Active Document application.

   Next, a form is opened before the READ EVENTS, which keeps the entire
   application from exiting as soon as the application starts.

6. In the ContainerRelease Event method code, place the CLEAR EVENTS command.

7. Save the Run Event code, the ContainerRelease code, the ADTest class and
   close the Class Designer.

8. Select the ADTest class in the Project Manager, it should have a fox head to
   the left. From the Project menu, point to the Set Main command. The font
   should turn bold.

9. Select the Documents tab and create a new form in the project. Do not use the
   Form Wizard.

10. In the new form, set the following properties:

         BorderStyle  0-No border
         ScrollBars   3-Both
         TitleBar     0-Off
         WindowState  2-Maximized
         Left         0
         Top          0

   The BackColor and Picture properties can also be set to any valid value.

11. Add a command button to the form. Change the Caption property of the Command
   button to "Quit" and place the following two lines of code in the Click
   Event method:

         Thisform.Release
         CLEAR EVENTS

12. Save the form as Adtest.scx and close the Form Designer.

13. The Active Document application is now ready to be built. In the Project
   Manager, select the Build button and make sure Build Application is selected
   in the Action section of the Build Options dialog box. Save the application
   as Adtest.app.

14. To run the Active Document application, Adtest.app, go to the Tools menu in
   Visual FoxPro and point to the Run Active Document... command. In the Run
   Active Document dialog box select Adtest.app for the Active Document combo
   box. In the Hosting combo box, select In Browser.

15. The Active Document application should have appeared in Internet Explorer.
   Note that selecting the Quit button leaves Internet Explorer loaded. Close
   Internet Explorer and run Adtest.app again. This time, close Internet
   Explorer with the Closebox in the upper left corner. Internet Explorer
   should close this time but before the form disappears, it will briefly show
   up in the main Visual FoxPro window. To prevent this, modify the ADTest
   class and change the ContainerReleaseType to:

         1-Don't show the Visual FoxPro main window

   Rebuild the application and test it again. This time, when Internet Explorer
   is closed, the form from the Active Document application will not show
   before closing.

For more information on Active Documents, follow the instructions below to get
into the Active Documents section of the Visual FoxPro "Programmer's Guide."

Steps to Active Documents Topic
-------------------------------

1. In the MSDN Library for Visual Studio 6.0, open the Visual FoxPro
   Documentation book, and go to the What's New in Visual FoxPro page. The
   Active Documents topic from the "Programmer's Guide" should be the second
   item listed.

2. Click Active Documents to open the Active Documents section of Chapter 31,
   "Interoperability and the Internet".

There is also a good sample in the Solutions sample under the New Features for
Visual FoxPro 6.0 category titled, "Create Active Documents for the Web". This
can also be accessed from the MSDN Library. Select Samples, Visual FoxPro
Samples, in the Visual FoxPro Documentation book instead of into Visual FoxPro
Documentation.
