SUMMARY
=======

You can have a Visual Basic application build a SQL query based on choices made
by a person using the application. The application can then use the SQL query
when creating a view into a database.

This article describes methods developers can use to create SQL queries that are
based on control properties or names of variables. The information in this
article applies to the following methods: FindFirst, FindLast, FindNext,
FindPrevious, CreateDynaset, CreateSnapshot, Execute, and ExecuteSQL.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When building a SQL query, do not include the variable or control name inside
the SQL string; instead, you should reference its value. Using the variable or
control name inside the SQL string is a mistake. For example, the following code
is incorrect:

      Dim ds As Recordset
      Set ds = MyDB.OpenRecordset("Employees", dbOpenDynaset)
         ds.FindFirst "NameField = Text1.Text"   ' This code is incorrect.

This code is trying to create a dynaset that finds the first occurrence of the
contents of Text1 in a field called NameField. Although the code does not
produce an error, it does not find the desired value. It searches for the first
occurrence of the string "Text1.Text" not the value of the Text1.Text control
property.

The criteria being sought is a string, so the programmer must use string
concatenation rules to build the criteria string. The following gives the
correct version of the code example:

      Dim ds As Recordset
      Set ds = MyDB.OpenRecordset("Employees", dbOpenDynaset)
         ds.FindFirst "NameField = '" & Text1.Text & "'"

The ampersand (&) operator concatenates the strings together correctly. Also,
in SQL syntax, you need to enclose string data in single quotation marks to
differentiate strings from variables.

If you think the corrected version looks confusing with all the single and double
quotation marks, you can assign the criteria to a string. Then use Debug.Print
to view the contents of the string. The following is the same example enhanced
to take advantage of the debug window:

      Dim ds As Recordset
      Dim SQL$ as String
      Set ds = MyDB.OpenRecordset("Employees", dbOpenDynaset)
         SQL$ = "NameField = '" & Text1.Text & "'"
         Debug.Print SQL$
         ds.FindFirst SQL$

If Text1 contains the string "Wilson," the Debug windows displays:

   NameField = 'Wilson'

If the data type of a field is a number instead of a string, do not enclose the
value being sought in single quotation marks. For example, use the following
code to create a dynaset that finds the first occurrence of a zip code in a
field called ZipCodeField where the ZipCodeField data type is not a string:

      Dim ds As Recordset
      Dim SQL$ as String
      Dim ZipCodeVar as Double
      Set ds = MyDB.OpenRecordset("Employees", dbOpenDynaset)
         ZipCodeVar = 98052
         SQL$ = "ZipCodeField = " & ZipCodeVar  ' This line builds the string.
         Debug.Print SQL$
         ds.FindFirst SQL$
