Path For Chapter Files Is Incorrect
-----------------------------------

Directions in this ALS textbook do not reflect the correct directory path
structure to the chapter and course files on the companion CD (Student CD). The
files for this ALS CD are located in the /textbook directory located at the CD
root. For example, <drive letter>:/textbook/chapter01.

Directions in the ALS text do not reflect the additional /textbook directory in
the path structure. Instead the text indicates that the files are located
directly at the CD root, i.e. <drive letter>:/chapter01.


Pages xliii & 43: Minimum Memory Requirement Is 128 MB
------------------------------------------------------

The minimum memory requirement for Windows 2000 Server is 128 MB.

The Note section on page 45 refers to a 7.8 GB maximum partition size. The 7.8 GB
limit only applies to Windows NT. Windows 2000 does not have this limit. Please
see the following articles for more information:

   Q224526 Windows NT 4.0 Supports Maximum of 7.8-GB System Partition

   Q240672 Setup Does Not Check for INT-13 Extensions Before Creating System
   Partition


Pages 45 & 910: Incorrect Minimum Boot Partition Size
-----------------------------------------------------

Lines 2 and 30 on page 45, and question 5 on page 910, list 671 MB as the minimum
boot partition size for installing Windows 2000 server. This is incorrect. The
minimum boot partition size is 1 GB.


Page 48: "Boot Partition" Should Be "System Partition"
------------------------------------------------------

On page 48, there are three places where "boot partition" should be referred to
as "system partition".

In the first paragraph under File System Considerations, change:
"Use the following guidelines and the table below to help you decide which file
system format to use for your boot partition."

In the table on page 49, Windows NT is incorrectly listed as compatible with the
FAT32 file system. Change:

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Operating system      | FAT16      | FAT32                                                           | NTFS       | 
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Overall compatibility | No changes | Recognized only by Windows 95 OSR2,Windows 98, and Windows 2000 | No changes | 
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


Page 77: Error In "Important" Section
-------------------------------------

Change:

   "ProductID+<your_product_key>"

To:

   "ProductID = "your product ID"


Page 117: Change "Unattend.txt" To "Unattend.bat"
-------------------------------------------------

On page 117, in the "Caution" section in Step 2,

Change:
"Unattend.txt"

To
"Unattend.bat"


Page 117: Incorrect Step 2
--------------------------

On page 117, in step 2,

Change:
"Open a command prompt and type cdh:"

To:
"Open a command prompt, type h: and press Enter."


Page 117: Unable To Connect To Server01
---------------------------------------

Step 1 on page 117 asks you to connect to Server01 from the second computer. You
may not be able to connect to Server01 if there is not a DHCP server available
on the network.

Solution:

If the second computer is running Windows 98, configure it to acquire an IP
address from a DHCP server.

Note: The two computers can communicate with each other this way. This is made
possible by a feature called Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) employed by
Windows 98 and Windows 2000. With this feature, a Windows 98/2000 computer can
assign itself an IP address in the event that a DHCP server is not available or
does not exist on the network. APIPA-enabled computers can only communicate
within the assigned subnet. The APIPA-assigned IP address is a class B address
in the range of 169.254.x.x.

If the second computer is running an operating system other than Windows 98,
please complete the following steps:

1. On Server01, run "ipconfig" at the command prompt to determine what the
   APIPA-assigned IP address is for Server01.

2. On the second computer, manually specify an IP address in the range of
   169.254.x.x other than the one assigned to Server01. Addresses 169.254.0.0
   and 169.254.255.255 are also invalid. Set the subnet mask to 255.255.0.0


Page 122: Incorrect Information About RIS
-----------------------------------------

On page 122, the fifth bulleted item lists "Remote Installation Service (RIS)" as
an automated installation method for Windows 2000 Server. This is incorrect.
Remote Installation Service is an automated installation method for Windows 2000
Professional only.


Page 122: Incorrect Information About Clean Installation With SMS
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The table on page 122 indicates that a clean installation of Windows 2000 can be
performed by SMS. This is incorrect. SMS can be used only for installations to
computers that contain a previously installed operating system and are running
the SMS client agent.

In the "Clean Installation" column for SMS,

Change:
"Yes"

To:
"No"


Page 124: Win32.exe Should Be Winnt32.exe
-----------------------------------------

On page 124, in the first paragraph under Figure 3.3, it incorrectly lists the
setup program name as "Win32.exe".

To:
"Any password supplied here will take effect only if the original source for the
image (master computer) specified a null password."


Page 154: Incorrect Information About Dynamic Disk Limitations
--------------------------------------------------------------

On page 154, remove the following statement under the "Dynamic Disk and Dynamic
Volume Limitations" section:

"Dynamic disks that are less fault tolerant than the simple volume, extended
simple volume, spanned volume, or striped volume cannot contain the boot or
system partition. This feature is built into Windows 2000 to provide a baseline
of fault tolerance for partitions containing operating system files."

You can upgrade a basic disk containing the system or boot partition to a dynamic
disk. For further information on converting a basic disk to a dynamic disk,
please refer to the Disk Management Help in Windows 2000.


Page 164: Delete "Server Operators Group"
-----------------------------------------

On page 164, in the first sentence under "Managing Disks on a Remote Computer",
delete Server Operators group.
