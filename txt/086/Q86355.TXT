The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows 3.1 
 - Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following information was taken from the Windows & MS-DOS 5 Upgrade
SETUP.TXT file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MICROSOFT WINDOWS 3.1 & MS-DOS 5 UPGRADE

SETUP.TXT
===================================================

This file provides important information not included in the
"Microsoft Getting Started" manual, the "Microsoft MS-DOS User's Guide
and Reference," the "Windows User's Guide" or in online Help.

Specifically, this file contains information about problems that might
occur while running the Windows and MS-DOS Setup program and describes
problems that can occur when using terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR)
programs or drivers with Windows or the Windows and MS-DOS Setup
program. If you are using a TSR or if you encounter problems setting
up Windows version 3.1, read this document BEFORE running Setup again.

For information about other files and documentation, see the "Welcome"
section of "Getting Started."

Note: Within this document, "Windows Setup" refers to the Windows part
of the Windows and MS-DOS Setup program.  You can execute the Windows
only part of this program by following the instructions below:

When this file instructs you to run Windows Setup, do the following:

--If this file instructs you to run Setup from the Main Group within
  the Windows Program Manager, carry out the procedure as stated.

--If you have not installed Microsoft Windows and MS-DOS,
  carry out the procedure described in "Getting Started."

--If you have installed Microsoft Windows and MS-DOS, and this
  file does not instruct you to run Setup from the Main Group,
  carry out the following procedure to run Setup for Windows only:

  1. Make drive C your current drive.
  2. Insert Setup Disk #1 into drive A.
  3. Type the following at the command prompt:
        a:setup /w

  This procedure for running a "Windows only" setup after MS-DOS has
  been installed is also described in Appendix A of "Getting Started."

General Setup Notes for the Windows portion of Setup
=====================================================

This section includes notes on specific system configurations that may
prevent Setup from installing Windows successfully. A solution to each
problem is provided.

If you are using a hardware or software product listed here, follow
the proposed recommendations before running Setup.

MS-DOS Screen Savers
---------------------

If you are using an MS-DOS screen saver, you should disable it before
running Setup. These screen savers can cause problems when running
Setup.

AT&T Safari Computer
----------------------
If you have an AT&T Safari computer, you cannot maintain two versions
of Windows (version 3.0 and version 3.1) on your system. You must
upgrade over version 3.0. If you set up Windows 3.1 in its own
directory, Windows will not use the special drivers required for it to
run on the Safari computer.

Using the TIGA Display Driver
-------------------------------
After successfully setting up Windows, you can increase the amount of
conventional memory available to non-Windows applications when Windows
is running in 386 enhanced mode by loading TIGACD.EXE from the
WINSTART.BAT file. The WINSTART.BAT file runs only in 386 enhanced
mode. If you want to run Windows in standard mode, you must load
TIGACD.EXE manually. For more information, see the README.WRI online
document.

Displays That Are Incompatible with Windows Version 3.1
---------------------------------------------------------
Certain display adapters can cause problems with Windows version 3.1.
The most serious problem is a system failure while running the Windows
and MS-DOS Setup program. If you encounter this problem, run Custom
Setup, and then select one of the standard display types, such as VGA,
provided with Windows version 3.1.

With other display drivers, Windows may be set up successfully but
TrueType fonts may not appear correctly on your screen. An updated
driver may be available in the Windows Driver Library or from your
display vendor or manufacturer. For information about obtaining the
Windows Driver Library, see "You have special hardware to set up with
Windows" in Chapter 3, "Troubleshooting During Setup," in "Getting
Started."

The following display adapters may cause problems:

-  ATI Graphics Ultra and Vantage

   Note: These adapters are 8514/a-compatible and run well
         with the 8514/a driver provided with Windows 3.1.

- All DGIS display adapters (Direct Graphics Interface Standard)
  from Graphic Software Systems, including the following:
        NEC MultiSynch Graphics Engine (MGE)
        Zenith Z-649
        HP IGC-10, IGC-20
        GSS 1000 Series

   NOTE: Some DGIS-based adapters are TIGA-compatible and
         run well when used with the appropriate TIGACD.EXE
         MS-DOS driver and with the TIGA driver provided with
         Windows 3.1.

- HP Ultra VGA
- IBM Image Adapter/A
- Matrox MG Series/M-WIN Series
- Palettized VGA 640x480, 16-color (provided with Windows
  Multimedia Extensions version 1.0)
- Radius SVGA MultiView

- All RGDI (Renaissance Graphics Device Interface) display
  adapters from Appian, Inc., including the following:
       Appian Rendition II, IIe, II/XE, and III
       Appian GV1024
       Decpc 433

- All S3 adapters, including the following:
      Orchid Fahrenheit 1280
      STB WIND/X
      Diamond Stealth VRAM

Using Stacker
-------------
If you are using Stacker to compress your hard disk, there are certain
steps you need to take before setting up Windows.
*  Before you run Setup, install MS-DOS 5.0 manually. For
   instructions, see section 2.21 of the README.TXT file.

*  If you have not set up MS-DOS 5.0, and you want to set up
   Windows only on a computer with an older version of Stacker,
   your computer might halt on Setup disk 3 while it is analyzing
   your system software. If this happens, remove the Setup disk,
   restart your computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL, and run
   Setup again by typing the following at the command prompt:

   a:setup /w /c

   Note: Before you run Setup again, make sure all the commands
         that load memory-resident programs have been disabled
         in your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files. To disable
         a command, type "rem" and a space in front of the command
         in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Then save the file,
         and restart your computer.

*  If you want to use a swap file with Windows, you must
   set up the swap file on the uncompressed drive. When
   setting up Stacker, you can leave at least 1 megabyte (MB)
   of disk space uncompressed for storing system files. To
   leave enough space for the swap file, it is recommended
   that the amount of uncompressed disk space equal at least
   twice the amount of system memory. For example, if your
   system has 4 MB of memory, you should leave at least 8 MB
   of disk space uncompressed. For more information about
   swap files, see "Working with Windows Swap Files" in Chapter 14,
   "Optimizing Windows," in the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide."

   If Stacker is already set up on your system and there is not
   enough uncompressed disk space for a swap file, you can run
   the STAC utility provided with Stacker to increase the amount
   of uncompressed disk space. For more information, see your
   Stacker documentation.

*  If you upgraded from an earlier version of Stacker to
   Stacker 2.0 or later, choose the Custom Setup option
   when you run Setup. When Setup prompts you, don't choose to let
   Setup modify your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. Modify
   these files yourself after Setup is complete by carrying out
   the following steps:

   * In your AUTOEXEC.BAT, add Windows to your path.

   * Copy the HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE files to your
     uncompressed drive, unless you use a different memory
     manager, such as QEMM-386.

   * Add DEVICE commands for HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE to
     your CONFIG.SYS file, unless you use a different memory
     manager such as QEMM-386. The command lines that load
     these drivers should appear before the command that loads
     STACKER.COM.

   * Make sure a copy of SMARTDRV.EXE is on the
     uncompressed drive. In your CONFIG.SYS file, the
     SMARTDRV.EXE command line should include the
     "/double_buffer" switch and should be the path
     of the file at boot time. For example, if SMARTDRV.EXE
     is in the root directory at boot time, you would include
     the following command in your CONFIG.SYS:

     DEVICE=C:\SMARTDRV.EXE /DOUBLE_BUFFER

     SMARTDRV.EXE should be loaded before STACKER.COM in the
     CONFIG.SYS file.

   * In the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, the SMARTDRV.EXE command
     line should be the path of the file after disk drives
     are swapped. Also, add the /L switch to the SMARTDRV.EXE
     command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

*  If you are using Stacker version 2.0 or later, but didn't
   upgrade from Stacker version 1.1, choose the Express Setup
   option when you are prompted. Setup will modify your CONFIG.SYS
   and AUTOEXEC.BAT files for you. When Setup is finished making
   the modifications, it displays a message at the end
   of the Windows portion of Setup that notifies you of the
   modifications that have been made. If you have used Stacker to
   swap your startup drive, when you restart your system Stacker will
   ask whether you want to update to the new version of the
   CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Choose Yes.

*  If you are using a version of Stacker earlier than 2.0, you
   need to modify your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files
   yourself, using the CONFIG.WIN and AUTOEXEC.WIN files that
   Setup generates. For information about using these files,
   see "Modifying Your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT Files Yourself,"
   following this topic.

*  After you have set up MS-DOS manually, type the following at
   the command prompt to set up Windows:

   a:setup /w

Modifying Your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT Files Yourself
---------------------------------------------------------
When you set up Windows, Setup usually places the HIMEM.SYS,
SMARTDRV.EXE, and EMM386.EXE files in the Windows directory.
If the Windows directory is on a disk that is not available
when you start your computer, such as a removable or nonlocal
disk, or if Setup detects one of the following conditions,
Setup does not modify the CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

- Your boot drive has been modified by a disk-compression
  utility.

- Your CONFIG.SYS file contains references to block device
  drivers.

- There is not enough available space on your hard disk to
  copy the files.

- The files are already installed on your system and Setup
  cannot overwrite them (they are read-only).

- The path in your AUTOEXEC.BAT is too long.

Instead, Setup writes proposed changes to the CONFIG.WIN and
AUTOEXEC.WIN or the CONFIG.00x and AUTOEXEC.00x files.
In this case, you must either move the HIMEM.SYS, SMARTDRV.EXE,
and EMM386.EXE files to a drive that is available when you start
your computer, or use a text editor to modify your CONFIG.SYS or
AUTOEXEC.BAT file so that any references to HIMEM.SYS,
SMARTDRV.EXE, and EMM386.EXE appear after the DEVICE=
command line used to load the drivers for your disk drives. Refer
to the CONFIG.WIN and AUTOEXEC.WIN or the CONFIG.00x and
AUTOEXEC.00x files for the proposed changes.

Setting Up XGA on a PS/2 Model 75 or 90
----------------------------------------
If you have a PS/2 model 75 or 90 with an XGA, the
Windows and MS-DOS Setup program will configure
the display adapter for 16-color, 640x480 resolution.
Do not change this configuration during Setup.
Specifying a different XGA configuration while setting
up Windows may cause Setup to fail.

After you have successfully installed Windows, you can
configure your XGA to use a different resolution or 256 colors,
if your monitor supports it. For more information on how to do
this, see the topic "IBM XGA" in the README.WRI online
document.

If you are using the plasma screen on the PS/2 model 75, use
ONLY the 640x480, 16-color configuration. If you change this
configuration, you will be returned to the MS-DOS prompt when
you try to start Windows.

Correcting the "Out of Environment Space" Error Message
-------------------------------------------------------
If you receive an "out of environment space" message when
starting Windows, you can either:

*  Increase the size of your environment by adding the SHELL=
   command line to your CONFIG.SYS file. See your MS-DOS
   documentation for more information about the SHELL command
   and modifying your CONFIG.SYS file.

*  Move the SET commands in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file
   to the beginning of the file so that they run before the
   commands that load terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR)
   programs or drivers, such as SMARTDrive.

If Setup Does Not Detect Your Network
--------------------------------------
If you have a network installed, you choose Custom Setup,
and Setup specifies "No Network" in the System-Information
screen, Setup is not able to detect your network. For Setup to
detect certain networks, the directory that contains the
network program files must be included in your path.

This is a known problem with these networks: 3Share, 3Open,
LAN Manager, and MSNet. If your path does not include the
directory where the network files are located, you can either:

*  Add the directory to the PATH line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
   file.

*  Run Custom Setup again and specify the full path for your
   network in the System-Information screen.

Using Terminate-and-Stay-Resident (TSR) Programs and Drivers
with Windows Version 3.1
=============================================================

The Program Listing section of this document lists several
terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs and drivers that
are known to cause problems when running with Windows version
3.1. Some of the problems you may encounter include system
failures or an incorrect display of information on your screen.
In some cases, special steps are provided to solve the problems.

While setting up Windows version 3.1, the Windows portion of
Setup searches the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files
for references to TSR programs and drivers, in addition to
scanning memory for TSRs that are currently running. If Setup
detects a TSR that is known to cause problems when running
with Windows version 3.1, a message appears, asking whether
you want to continue or quit Setup.

If you receive such a message, do the following:

1. Locate your TSR in the Program Listing section of this document
   and use the information to determine if the situation encountered
   prevents Windows Setup from successfully installing Windows 3.1.

2. If the situation does not affect Windows Setup, you can continue
   setting up Windows 3.1 by following the instructions on your
   screen.

   If the situation does affect Windows Setup and prevents it from
   installing Windows on your computer, follow the instructions
   on the screen to quit Setup, and then complete the following
   steps.

3. Quit the TSR and remove all references to it from your
   AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files. For more information,
   see the documentation for your TSR.

4. Restart your computer.

5. Run Windows Setup again.

After Windows is successfully set up, you may want to restore
your TSRs.

Not all TSRs or drivers included in the Program Listing section
are detected by Setup. The TSRs and drivers that Setup detects
are in the SETUP.INF file, listed under the names "incomptsr1"
and "incomptsr2".

Program Listing
===============
This section describes some problems, discovered during testing, that
you might encounter while using a TSR with Windows version 3.1. It
does not include all possible problems that can occur.

386MAX
------
The documentation for 386MAX recommends against setting the EXT
parameter below 64. If you set this parameter to 0, Windows Setup and
Windows running in standard mode will fail.

See the README.WRI online document for more information about running
386MAX with Windows 3.1.

386MAX Disk-Cache Utility (QCACHE.EXE)
--------------------------------------
Do not use this disk-cache utility simultaneously with SMARTDrive.
There is no reason to use two disk-cache utilities with Windows. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, which is installed with Windows
3.1, instead.

All Charge 386 Version 3.1
--------------------------
ALLEMM4.SYS is a memory manager that causes problems with Setup and
Windows 3.1. If you encounter problems running this program with
Windows, it is recommended that you use EMM386.EXE and HIMEM.SYS,
provided with Windows 3.1, to manage memory instead.

Anarkey Version 4.00
--------------------
With some memory configurations, Anarkey version 4.00 running with
Windows 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode may cause unpredictable system
failures. In rare cases, this program can also corrupt hard-disk data.
In addition, Windows 3.1 might not start when this program is running.

Do not run Windows 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode when Anarkey version
4.00 is running. Version 4.01 may correct these problems. Contact
Moderne Software for a free upgrade of Anarkey 4.01.

Anarkey Version 4.01
--------------------
If Anarkey version 4.01 is loaded before starting Windows in standard
mode, it is not available in any MS-DOS Prompt that you start from
Windows. In this case, it is recommended that you load Anarkey from
each MS-DOS Prompt, as needed.

Do not load Anarkey HIGH before starting Windows in 386 enhanced mode.
If you load Anarkey HIGH, your system may fail when you try to start
an application.

APPEND (MS-DOS)
---------------
Do not use the APPEND utility with Windows 3.1. It prevents Windows
and Windows applications from creating valid Well-Formed-Path (WFP)
names for the files they are using. (A WFP is the complete name of a
file, including the drive letter and full path specification, starting
from the root directory.)

ASP Integrity Toolkit Version 3.7
---------------------------------
This product is a virus-protection program that can cause problems
when running Windows Setup, including system failure, automatic
restarting of the system, and the inability to use the keyboard. You
should turn off protection in the toolkit before setting up Windows
3.1. For information about how to do this, see your ASP Integrity
documentation.

Note: Setting up Windows is considered a system-administration
      task. The ASP Integrity Toolkit documentation instructs
      you to turn off protection when performing these types
      of tasks.

ASSIGN.COM
----------
If you are using this MS-DOS utility to reassign a drive letter,
change the drive back to its original letter by typing the following
at the command prompt before you run Setup:

assign

Autocon Version 2.0e
--------------------
Autocon enables you to select up to fifty different configurations
when starting your system. To do this, it modifies the CONFIG.SYS
and AUTOEXEC.BAT files, based on information in its database
(AUTOCON.DAT), when you restart your system from within AUTOCON.

Windows Setup modifies only the first section in the CONFIG.SYS
and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. If you want to use specific configurations
with Windows, you must run Autocon and then manually edit the
configurations in the database that you want to use. You must do
this after setting up Windows. For your changes to take effect,
you must restart your system from within Autocon. For more
information, see your Autocon documentation.

Bootcon Version 1.60
--------------------
Using Bootcon, you can maintain different system-configuration
information in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. You can then
select the configuration you want to use from a menu when starting
your system.

Windows Setup modifies only the first section in the CONFIG.SYS
and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. You must edit the sections of those files
that contain the configurations you want to use after you set up
Windows. For more information, see your Bootcon documentation.

BOOT.SYS
---------
Using BOOT.SYS, you can maintain different system-configuration
information in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. You can then
select the configuration you want to use from a menu when starting
your system.

Windows Setup modifies only the first section in the CONFIG.SYS
and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. You must edit the sections of those files
that contain the configurations you want to use after you set
up Windows. For more information, see your BOOT.SYS documentation.

Bootsafe
--------
If you are running Bootsafe, you may experience problems while
running Setup. Carry out the following procedure:

1    Open your AUTOEXEC.BAT with any text editor.
2    Type "REM" and a space in front of the line that loads
     Bootsafe. For example, the line might look something like this:

     rem c:\cpav\bootsafe

3    Save the file, and restart your computer by pressing
     CTRL+ALT+DEL.
4    Run Setup again.

CACHE.EXE Disk-Cache Utility
----------------------------
Do not use two disk-cache utilities with Windows 3.1. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows 3.1, and
remove all references to other disk-cache utilities from your
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. (If CACHE.EXE is detected, Setup
removes it from the CONFIG.SYS file for you.)

CACHE.SYS Disk-Cache Utility
----------------------------
This disk-cache utility will not work properly with SMARTDrive. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows 3.1, and
remove all references to other disk-cache utilities from your
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. (If CACHE.SYS is detected, Setup
removes it from the CONFIG.SYS file for you.)

CED Version 1.0e
----------------
Using CED with Windows 3.1 may cause problems, including system
failure. It is recommended that you do not use CED with Windows 3.1.

Central Point Anti-Virus Version 1.1 (VSAFE.COM/VSAFE.SYS)
----------------------------------------------------------
VSAFE.COM/VSAFE.SYS should not be loaded when you set up Windows 3.1.
Otherwise, Setup may not run properly. After you set up Windows 3.1,
you can load VSAFE.

Because Windows uses the disk for memory swapping, you should turn off
the VSAFE write-protection option when running Windows. For more
information, see the Central Point Anti-Virus documentation.

CMDEDIT.COM Version 2.0 (Date 12-6-91)
--------------------------------------
If this command-line editor is loaded before starting Windows, it may
cause a General Protection Fault when running multiple MS-DOS Prompts
in 386 enhanced mode. Also, it cannot be loaded from an MS-DOS Prompt
within Windows when Windows is running in standard mode.

Cubit Version 3.01
------------------
When using Cubit with Windows 3.1, do not compress the Windows SYSTEM
directory or any file that is loaded from the CONFIG.SYS file.
Compressing these files could cause problems.

Before upgrading to Windows 3.1, make sure that the earlier version of
Windows is uncompressed on your hard disk. You may recompress the
files after you have successfully set up Windows 3.1.

Data Physician Plus Version 2.0 (VirALERT)
------------------------------------------
It is recommended that you do not set up Windows while VirALERT is
running. If you do, VirALERT will display a warning message every few
seconds while Setup is running.

After you have set up Windows, you can run VirALERT. Press ALT+V to
display the VirALERT menu. You can use the commands on this menu to
disable and enable VirALERT.

DOSCUE.COM Command-Line Editor
------------------------------
The DOSCUE command-line editor produces unexpected results when used
with Windows version 3.1. It is recommended that you do not use this
editor with Windows 3.1.

Doubledisk Version 2.5
----------------------
Windows 3.1 may try to access "phantom" disk drives if you use
Doubledisk with Windows 3.1. Phantom drives occur when you
use Doubledisk to create a compressed drive. For example, if you
have drives A, B, and C on your computer and you use Doubledisk
to create drive F, Windows 3.1 (and MS-DOS) recognize drives D
and E as valid drives, even though they do not actually exist. You
can use the DRVOFF utility to prevent Windows from recognizing
phantom drives. Contact Vertisoft to order a copy of the DRVOFF
utility.

FASTOPEN (MS-DOS)
-----------------
FASTOPEN is a RAM resident utility. Problems involving the file
allocation table (FAT) may occur if FASTOPEN is used together with
disk de-fragmenting utilities. In low-memory situations, you may need
to remove FASTOPEN for Windows 3.1 to run properly.

Flash Disk-Cache Utility (FLASH.EXE)
-------------------------------------
Do not use this disk-cache utility simultaneously with SMARTDrive.
There is no reason to use two disk-cache utilities with Windows. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, which is installed with Windows
3.1, instead.

Graphics (MS-DOS)
-----------------
Loading Graphics from an MS-DOS Prompt within Windows can cause
unexpected results when printing. The active MS-DOS Prompt will send
its output to the printer. Switching between MS-DOS Prompts may result
in mixed printing jobs.

HIMEMSLS.SYS (Software Carousel)

If you use the HIMEMSLS.SYS driver with Software Carousel, open your
CONFIG.SYS with any text editor, and delete the command that loads the
driver. Then save the file, restart your system, and run Setup.

Setup will install the HIMEM.SYS driver when it installs Windows.
Use the HIMEM.SYS driver; do not reinstall the HIMEMSLS.SYS driver.

HPEMM386.SYS and HPEMM486.SYS
-----------------------------
These expanded-memory managers are incompatible with Windows when it
is running in 386 enhanced mode. If you plan on running Windows in 386
enhanced mode, it is recommended that you use EMM386.EXE to manage
memory instead.

HPMM.SYS - HP Memory Manager
----------------------------
When HPMM.SYS is running, you cannot set up Windows 3.1 or run it in
standard mode. You should remove all references to HPMM.SYS from your
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files before setting up Windows 3.1.

Hyperdisk Disk-Cache Utility
----------------------------
Do not use this disk-cache utility simultaneously with SMARTDrive.
There is no reason to use two disk-cache utilities with Windows. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, which is installed with Windows
3.1, instead.

IBM VDISK.SYS (RAM Disk Utility)
--------------------------------
VDISK.SYS is incompatible with Windows because it occupies extended
memory required to run Windows. This utility prevents any XMS-
compatible memory manager from loading.

IEMM.SYS Memory Manager
-----------------------
The IEMM.SYS memory manager is incompatible with Windows. It is
recommended that you remove all references to IEMM.SYS from your
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files and use EMM386.EXE, provided with
Windows 3.1, to manage memory instead.

ICACHE.SYS Disk-Cache Utility
-----------------------------
Do not use two disk-cache utilities with Windows version 3.1. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows 3.1, and
remove all references to other disk-cache utilities from your
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. (If ICACHE.SYS is detected, Setup
removes it from the CONFIG.SYS file for you.)

IBMCACHE.SYS Disk-Cache Utility
-------------------------------
Do not use two disk-cache utilities with Windows version 3.1. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows 3.1, and
remove all references to other disk-cache utilities from your
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. (If IBMCACHE.SYS is detected, Setup
removes it from the CONFIG.SYS file for you.)

Intel Expanded-Memory Emulator (ILIM386.SYS)
--------------------------------------------
The ILIM386.SYS expanded-memory emulator, provided with the Intel
Inboard/386 product, is incompatible with Windows 3.1. It is
recommended that you remove all references to this emulator from your
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files before setting up Windows 3.1.

JOIN (MS-DOS)
-------------
Do not add or remove "joined" drives while running Windows 3.1. If you
use the JOIN command before starting Windows 3.1 and do not change the
state of the joined drives from an MS-DOS Prompt within Windows,
Windows 3.1 will work properly. It is recommended that you do not use
joined drives at all if you plan on running Windows.

KBFLOW TSR by Artisoft
----------------------
If you load the KBFLOW TSR utility provided by Artisoft before
starting Windows 3.1, your system may fail when starting or using an
MS-DOS Prompt from within Windows.

KEYB.COM (MS-DOS)
-----------------
If you use command-line options to load KEYB.COM, it is recommended
that you load it before starting Windows. After it is loaded, you can
change the keyboard configuration from an MS-DOS Prompt within Windows
any time. If you do not load KEYB.COM before starting windows, you may
encounter problems using a KEYB command that includes an option in an
MS-DOS Prompt. However, you can use the KEYB command without options
at any time to display code-page information.

Lansight Version 2.0
--------------------
Lansight is a utility that you can use to control and monitor other
workstations attached to a Novell network. In some cases, version 2.0
of Lansight may cause the workstation running Windows 3.1 to fail.

Lasertool Control Panel Version 2.2
------------------------------------
If you load version 2.2 of the Lasertool Control Panel program
(PCPANEL.EXE) from Windows 3.1, your system may fail. This program
works properly if you load it before starting Windows.

Le Menu Version 1.0
-------------------
When using Le Menu version 1.0 with Windows 3.1, environment
information such as PATH, PROMPT and WINDIR may be lost if you start
an MS-DOS Prompt from within Windows. If you want to start Windows 3.1
by using a Le Menu menu command, it is recommended that you set up
Windows 3.1 as a Batch-File menu command so that COMMAND.COM will load
before starting Windows 3.1. For more information, see your Le Menu
documentation.

LOCKIT Version 3.3 (PC Vault, Secure It)
----------------------------------------
Version 3.3 of these programs strips out spaces from the LOAD= command
line in the WIN.INI file. Later versions may correct this problem.

Logitech Mouse Software Version 5.0/6.0 (CLICK, LOGIMENU)
---------------------------------------------------------
If you want to use CLICK and LOGIMENU from an MS-DOS Prompt within
Windows, you must load the TSRs from that MS-DOS Prompt, even if you
loaded the TSRs before starting Windows. When you quit Windows, you
must reload the TSRs for them to work properly from the MS-DOS prompt
outside of Windows, even if you loaded them from an MS-DOS Prompt
within Windows.

Mace Disk-Cache Utility (MCACHE.SYS)
------------------------------------
This disk-cache utility will not work properly with SMARTDrive. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows 3.1, and
remove all references to other disk-cache utilities from your
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. (If Mace is detected, Setup
removes it from the CONFIG.SYS file for you.)

Maximizer Memory Manager (MAXIMIZE.COM)
---------------------------------------
If you are using the Maximizer memory manager, you may not be able to
set up or start Windows. Make sure that you are using only one memory
manager with Windows 3.1. It is recommended that you use HIMEM.SYS and
EMM386.EXE, which are installed with Windows 3.1, to manage memory
instead.

MIRROR (MS-DOS)
-----------------
If MIRROR is loaded from Windows 3.1 by using the Run command in
standard mode, you cannot remove it from memory by using the MIRROR /U
command. This will cause an error message to appear.

NDOSEDIT.COM (Date 1-1-84)
--------------------------
You may have problems loading this command-line editor. Also, it may
cause unexpected results when running with Windows 3.1.

NetRoom Memory Manager (RM386.SYS)
----------------------------------
With some older versions of NetRoom, you may encounter problems
setting up Windows. In this case, contact Helix Software for a newer
version of NetRoom.

Newspace Version 1.07
---------------------
This disk-compression utility is incompatible with Windows 3.1 and may
cause several problems.

Norton Anti-Virus Version 1.0
-----------------------------
If you load version 1.0 of Anti-Virus before setting up Windows, Setup
may fail. It is recommended that you contact Symantec for the most
current version of this program.

Norton Desktop for Windows (EP.EXE)
-----------------------------------
If the data-recovery program Erase Protect (EP.EXE) is loaded from the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file, you need to disable it when setting up Windows 3.1,
especially if you are upgrading over a previous version of Windows.
Erase Protect tries to save copies of all deleted files, which can
cause you to run out of disk space while running Setup. It is
recommended that you run Erase Protect with a permanent swap file, not
a temporary swap file. If you are using a temporary swap file, you
need to exclude files with a .TMP or .SWP extension from erase
protection.

Norton Utilities Version 5.0 (DISKREET, NCACHE)
-----------------------------------------------
This program is incompatible with Windows 3.1 and may cause your
system to fail. It is recommended that you upgrade to the most recent
version of Norton Utilities to correct problems.

Norton Utilities Version. 6.01 (NCACHE)
---------------------------------------
Some versions of NCACHE may prevent you from setting up or starting
Windows 3.1. When Windows is running in standard mode, your system may
fail, especially if NCACHE is set up as an EMS cache. Setting up
NCACHE as an EMS cache is not recommended. Setting up NCACHE as an XMS
cache may solve the problem.

You may also encounter additional problems using NCACHE. New versions
may correct these problems. For an updated version of NCACHE, contact
Symantec Corporation. In the meantime, you can use SMARTDrive, which
is provided with Windows 3.1.

Norton Utilities Version 6.01 (DISKMON)
--------------------------------------
It is recommended that you do not use DISKMON version 6.01 with
Windows 3.1.

PCED Version 2.00
-----------------
Do not load the PCED command-line editor HIGH. Loading it HIGH may
cause unexpected results, such as system failures, when Windows is
running in 386 enhanced mode. If you load this program before starting
Windows, it may be unavailable when Windows is running in standard
mode.

PCKEY.EXE (MultiSoft Keyboard Enhancer and Command-Line Stack)
--------------------------------------------------------------
PCKEY.EXE may not work properly with Windows 3.1 when you are running
more than one non-Windows application at a time. It is recommended
that you unload PCKEY.EXE before starting Windows.

PC-Kwik Disk Accelerator
------------------------
If you use PC-Kwik when Windows is running in 386 enhanced mode, make
sure that you are using version 3.55 or later and that PC-Kwik is in
extended memory, not expanded memory. To get an upgraded version of
PC-Kwik, contact MultiSoft.

PC-Kwik Disk-Cache Utility (PC-KWIK.EXE)
----------------------------------------
Do not use this disk-cache utility simultaneously with SMARTDrive.
There is no reason to use two disk-cache utilities with Windows. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows 3.1,
instead.

PC-Kwik Version. 1.59 (PCK.EXE, PSKSCRN.EXE, PCKEY.COM)
-------------------------------------------------------
If version 1.59 of PC-KWIK is loaded before setting up Windows,
Setup may fail. PC-KWIK Version 2.0 may correct this problem.

PCSXMAEM.SYS Utility
--------------------
This utility is incompatible with Windows. You should remove all
references to it from your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files before
setting up or starting Windows 3.1. PCSXMAEM.SYS is similar to
XMAEM.SYS. It has been renamed and slightly modified. It is provided
with current versions of the IBM PC/3270 emulator.

PCSX2EMS.SYS
-------------
Windows will run correctly with PCSX2EMS.SYS if it is loaded on a
computer that has an XMA board installed. Otherwise, this program is
incompatible with Windows. PCSX2EMS.SYS is provided with the IBM
PC/3270 emulator.

PC Tools Deluxe Version 7.1 (DATAMON)
------------------------------------
If you load PC Tools DATAMON using the \SENTRY+ option, Setup may fail
if you are low on disk space. Do not use the \SENTRY+ option when
loading DATAMON.

Do not load DATAMON after loading SMARTDrive. If DATAMON is loaded
after SMARTDrive, your system may fail. See the PC Tools documentation
for information about how to unload DATAMON.

PC Tools Deluxe Version 6.0 (DESKTOP)
------------------------------------
If you try to start PC Tools from an MS-DOS Prompt within Windows in
standard mode, your system may fail. In enhanced mode, your system may
restart itself. These problems also occur if you use MS-DOS commands
from an MS-DOS Prompt within Windows.

Version 7.0 of PC Tools may correct these problems.  However, do not
load DESKTOP from an MS-DOS Prompt if it was loaded before starting
Windows 3.1. If you do, your system may fail when you quit Windows. It
is recommended that you run DESKTOP from its PIF, provided with
Windows 3.1.

PC Tools Deluxe Version 7.1 (VDEFEND)
-------------------------------------
Setup may not work properly if VDEFEND is loaded before running Setup.
You may load VDEFEND after setting up Windows 3.1.

PC Tools Disk-Cache Utility (PC-CACHE.COM)
-----------------------------------------
Do not use this disk-cache utility simultaneously with SMARTDrive.
There is no reason to use two disk-cache utilities with Windows. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, which is installed with Windows
3.1, instead.

PRINT (MS-DOS)
--------------
If you are printing several large documents on a network printer and
run Windows Setup from the network, your system may fail while Setup
is creating Program Manager groups.

Printer Assist Version 4.20
---------------------------
Printer Assist is a TSR that you can use to share a workstation
printer with other workstations on Netware 286 and 386 systems. Some
Windows applications (such as Microsoft Word for Windows) print
extended characters, mixed with correct output when this program is
loaded.

PYRO! Version 1.0
-----------------
If this screen saver is loaded before starting Windows 3.1, you may
not be able to restore the Windows 3.1 screen after this screen saver
appears.

QMAPS Memory Manager Version 5.16
---------------------------------
If you are using the QMAPS memory manager, you may not be able to set
up or start Windows. New versions may correct these problems. For an
updated version of QMAPS, contact Quadtel. In the meantime, you may
use HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE, provided with Windows 3.1, to manage
memory instead.

RAMTYPE.SYS - AST RAMpage! Boards
---------------------------------
The RAMTYPE.SYS driver is incompatible with Windows. It is recommended
that you remove this driver before setting up Windows 3.1. If you load
the driver from your CONFIG.SYS file, comment out the command line for
the driver as follows:

   rem RAMTYPE.SYS

Windows 3.1 will run correctly without RAMTYPE.SYS. However, other
drivers that rely on RAMTYPE.SYS will not load and applications will
not be able to use the expanded memory on your system.

After setting up Windows, you can use version 1.2 and later of
RAMTYPE.SYS with Windows. If you are using an earlier version on an
IBM PS/2 or micro-channel architecture computer and your RAMpage!
board is configured for expanded and extended memory, you need to
upgrade your AST RAMTYPE.SYS driver after setting up Windows. You will
also need to remove the "rem" command from your CONFIG.SYS file so
that RAMTYPE.SYS will load properly.

Secretdisk II Disk-Cache Utility (FAST512.SYS)
----------------------------------------------
This disk-cache utility will not work properly with SMARTDrive. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows 3.1, and
remove all references to other disk-cache utilities from your
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. (If this utility is detected, Setup
removes it from the CONFIG.SYS file for you.)

SideKick Versions 1.0 and 2.0 and SideKick Plus
-----------------------------------------------
Miscellaneous problems may occur when running SideKick as a TSR with
Windows 3.1. It is recommended that you use a PIF to run SideKick as a
non-Windows application, instead of loading it as a TSR.

SoftIce Debugger
----------------
If SoftIce is loaded, Setup will fail when starting the Windows
portion of the program. It is recommended that you unload SoftIce
before setting up Windows 3.1.

SpeedFXR
--------
This program is incompatible with Windows 3.1 when running as a TSR.
It tries to increase the speed of the floppy disk drives, but slows
them down instead. To get the best results, use the -X option when
loading SpeedFXR. This will prevent SpeedFXR from remaining in memory
and affecting the speed of the floppy disk drives.

SUBST (MS-DOS)
--------------
Do not add or remove "substituted" drives while running Windows 3.1.
If you use the SUBST command before starting Windows and do not change
the state of the substituted drives from an MS-DOS Prompt within
Windows, Windows 3.1 will work properly.

Super PC-Kwik Disk-Cache Utility (SUPERPCK.EXE)
-----------------------------------------------
Do not use this disk-cache utility simultaneously with SMARTDrive.
There is no reason to use two disk-cache utilities with Windows. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, which is installed with Windows
3.1, instead.

Trantor T100 Host Adapter Driver (TSCSI.SYS)
--------------------------------------------
(For SCSI hard disk drives) - If you use the Trantor T100 driver
(TSCSI.SYS), you must use version 4.33d or higher. Earlier versions
identify the SCSI hard disk drive as a removable drive. This may cause
problems when using File Manager, such as a system failure while
formatting the drive and unexpected results when deleting files. To
get an updated driver, contact Trantor Systems, Ltd.

UMB PRO Version 1.07
--------------------
If you are running UMB PRO, you may experience problems running
Windows in standard mode. In some cases, your system may fail. Make
sure that you are using only one memory manager with Windows 3.1. It
is recommended that you use HIMEM.SYS and EMM386.EXE, which are
installed with Windows 3.1, to manage memory instead.

Vaccine
-------
If Vaccine is loaded, Setup fails when trying to modify the CONFIG.SYS
and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. You should unload Vaccine before setting up
Windows 3.1. You may also encounter problems, such as beeping, while
running Windows when Vaccine is loaded.

VIREX-PC Version 1.11
---------------------
If VIREXPC.COM is loaded, Windows Setup and Windows 3.1 will fail when
KRNL386.EXE performs a write operation. Also, the first time Windows
3.1 is loaded, you may be returned to the MS-DOS prompt.

Virus Prevention Plus Version 5.0
---------------------------------
If Virus Prevention Plus is loaded, you may not be able to
successfully set up Windows 3.1. You may also encounter problems when
running Windows 3.1 in 386 enhanced mode. The Keyboard Lock program
may cause Windows to fail.

Virusafe Version 4.0
--------------------
If this program is loaded as a TSR, Setup may fail while setting
up Windows 3.1. It is recommended that you load Virusafe by using
the /C- option. This option turns off the memory-change detection
provided with Virusafe. Version 4.5 may correct this problem.
For more information, see your Virusafe documentation.

XGAAIDOS.SYS
------------
With XGAAIDOS.SYS loaded, Windows 3.1 will fail at the opening
logo if you use the WIN /s option to start Windows in standard mode.

XMAEM.SYS
---------
XMAEM.SYS is a device which causes extended memory to act like XMA.
This utility is incompatible with Windows 3.1. It is recommended that
you remove all references to it from your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
files before setting up or running Windows 3.1. XMAEM.SYS is provided
with IBM DOS version 4.0.

XMA2EMS.SYS
-----------
Windows will run correctly with XMA2EMS.SYS if it is loaded on a
computer that has an XMA board installed. Otherwise, this program is
incompatible with Windows. XMA2EMS.SYS is provided with IBM DOS
version 4.0.
