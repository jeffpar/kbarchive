MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0
-------------------------------

401.1 - Unauthorized: Logon Failed:

This error may occur for the following reasons:

 - Local security policies. Every OWA user requires access to two local security
   policies:

    - The first local security policy is "Log On Locally." To make sure that
      your users have this setting enabled:

      1. Start User Manager for Domains.

      2. On the Policies menu, click User Rights.

      3. In the User Rights dialog box, click "Log on Locally".

      4. In the Grant To box, add a domain group that your users belong to.
         Typically, this group is the Domain Users group. Adding such a domain
         group ensures that your users have access to log on locally.

    - The second local security policy is "Access This Computer From the
      Network." To make sure that your users have this setting enabled:

      1. Start User Manager for Domains.

      2. On the Policies menu, click User Rights.

      3. In the User Rights dialog box, click "Access This Computer From the
         Network".

      4. In the Grant To box, add a domain group that your users belong to.
         Typically, this group is the Domain Users group. Adding such a domain
         group allows your OWA users access through this policy.

 - Basic authentication and the Windows NT domain name. OWA supports two
   authentication methods. Those methods are "Basic" and "Windows NT Challenge
   Response (NTLM)". If you use the Basic authentication method in OWA and you
   do not supply a default domain name, you may receive this error message
   because the domain is omitted in the credentials dialog box.

   To determine whether or not you are experiencing this issue, after you type
   your mailbox name in OWA, look at the credentials dialog box. If two boxes
   are displayed ("User name" and Password), you are probably using Basic
   authentication. If three boxes are displayed ("User name", Password, and
   Domain), you are probably using NTLM authentication.

   The exception to this rule is Microsoft Internet Explorer 6. If you use
   Internet Explorer 6, only the "User name" and Password boxes are displayed in
   the credentials dialog box, even if you are using NTLM authentication.

   After you determine that you are using Basic authentication, try using the
   following format for your logon information:

    - "User name":

   <Windows_NT_domain_name>\<user_name> (for example,
   microsoft\user1)

    - Password:

   <user's_password>

If you can use the preceding format to log on without receiving the 401.1 error
message, to avoid this issue in the future, either:

    - Instruct your users to log on by using that format.

-or-

    - Add a default domain in the Basic authentication section of Internet
      Information Services (IIS) for OWA:

      1. On the OWA server, start Internet Services Manager.

      2. Expand the Web site in which OWA is installed, right-click the Exchange
         virtual directory, and then click Properties.

      3. Click the Directory Security tab, and then click Edit next to
         "Anonymous access and Authentication Control".

      4. Click Edit next to "Basic authentication".

      5. Use one of the following steps, as appropriate:

          - If all of your user accounts exist in one Windows NT domain, type
            that domain name in the Default Domain box.

-or-

          - If your user accounts are spread among multiple domains, it is
            easier to type "\" (without the quotation marks) in the Default
            Domain box. If you type "\" (without the quotation marks) in the
            Default Domain box, OWA searches all of the trusted domains for the
            user name.

After you add a default domain, the users can gain access to OWA by just
supplying their user name and password, instead of typing
<domain>\<user_name>.

 - File-level antivirus scanning software. A file-level antivirus scanning
   utility that is actively scanning the Exchsrvr folder on the hard disk can
   also cause this error. This issue can also manifest itself as a blank screen
   in the Web browser, instead of as an error message.

   At a minimum, exclude the Exchsrvr\Mdbdata, Exchsrvr\Webdata, and
   Exchsrvr\Webtemp folders from file-level antivirus scans. If you do not
   exclude these folders, issues may occur with both OWA and MAPI clients. Refer
   to your antivirus software's documentation for instructions about how to
   exclude files and folders.

   If you are concerned about mail-related viruses in Microsoft Exchange Server,
   obtain antivirus software which is "Exchange Server-aware". Exchange
   Server-aware antivirus software uses scanning methods for the Exchange Server
   store that are not damaging. Exchange Server-aware antivirus software uses
   the antivirus application programming interface (API) that is built into
   Exchange Server.

401.3 - Unauthorized Due to ACL on Resource:

This error is usually the result of not having the required NTFS security
permissions on a file or registry key. To determine if this error is the result
of not having the required NTFS security permissions:

1. Confirm that the Everyone group has at least the minimum permissions that are
   required on the folders in the following table. To view the permissions on a
   folder, open the properties of the folder, and then click the Security tab.
   If the Security tab is missing, the folder resides on a file allocation table
   (FAT) partition. There are no specific file-level permissions on a FAT
   partition. If the folder is on a FAT partition, skip to step 2 (registry
   permissions).

   +----------------------------------+
   | Folder              | Permission | 
   +----------------------------------+
   | X:\Exchsrvr         | Read       | 
   +----------------------------------+
   | X:\Exchsrvr\Webdata | Change     | 
   +----------------------------------+
   | X:\Exchsrvr\Webtemp | Change     | 
   +----------------------------------+
   | X:\Exchsrvr\Bin     | Read       | 
   +----------------------------------+
   | X:\Exchsrvr\Res     | Read       | 
   +----------------------------------+
   | X:\Winnt            | Read       | 
   +----------------------------------+
   | X:\Winnt\System32   | Read       | 
   +----------------------------------+

2. Confirm that the Everyone group has at least the minimum permissions required
   on the registry keys in the following table. To view security settings on
   registry keys:

   1. Click Start, and then click Run.

   2. In the Run dialog box, type "regedt32.exe" (without the quotation marks).

   3. Click the registry key that you want to view the security settings for,
      and then click Permissions on the Security menu.

Microsoft Windows 2000 Server
-----------------------------

401.1 - Unauthorized: Logon Failed:

This error may occur for the following reasons:

 - Local security policies. Every OWA user requires access to two local security
   policies:

    - The first security policy is "Log On Locally." To make sure that your
      users have this setting turned on:

      1. Start the Local Security Policy snap-in.

         NOTE: If OWA is installed on a Windows 2000-based computer that is a
         domain controller, start the Domain Controller Security Policy snap-in.

      2. Expand Local Policies, and then expand User Rights Assignment.

      3. In the right pane, click "Log on Locally".

      4. In the Assign To box, add a domain group that your users belong to.
         Typically, this group is the Domain Users group. Adding such a domain
         group ensures that your users have access to log on locally.

    - The second Local Security Policy is "Access This Computer From the
      Network." To make sure that your users have this setting turned on:

      1. Start the Local Security Policy snap-in.

         NOTE: If OWA is installed on a Windows 2000-based computer that is a
         domain controller, start the Domain Controller Security Policy snap-in.

      2. Expand Local Policies, and then expand User Rights Assignment.

      3. In the right pane, click "Access This Computer From the Network".

      4. In the Assign To box, add a domain group that your users belong to.
         Typically, this group is the Domain Users group. Adding such a domain
         group allows your OWA users access through this policy.

 - Basic authentication and the Windows NT domain name. OWA supports two
   authentication methods. Those methods are "Basic" and "Windows NT Challenge
   Response (NTLM)." If you use the Basic authentication method in OWA and you
   do not supply a default domain name, you may receive this error message
   because the domain name is omitted in the credentials dialog box.

   To determine whether or not you are experiencing this issue, after you type
   your mailbox name in OWA, view the credentials dialog box. If two boxes are
   displayed ("User name" and Password), you are probably using Basic
   authentication. If three boxes are displayed ("User name", Password, and
   Domain), you are probably using NTLM authentication.

   The exception to this rule is Internet Explorer 6. If you use Internet
   Explorer 6, only the "User name" and Password boxes are displayed in the
   credentials dialog box, even if you are using NTLM authentication.

   After you determine that you are using Basic authentication, try using the
   following format for your logon information:

    - "User name":

   <Windows_NT_domain_name>\<user_name> (for example,
   microsoft\user1)

    - Password:

   <user's_password>

   If you can use the preceding format to log on without receiving the 401.1
   error message, to avoid this issue in the future, either:

    - Instruct your users to log on by using that format.

-or-

    - Add a default domain in the basic authentication section of IIS for OWA:

      1. On the OWA server, start Internet Services Manager.

      2. Expand the Web site in which OWA is installed, right-click the Exchange
         virtual directory, and then click Properties.

      3. Click the Directory Security tab, and then click Edit next to
         "Anonymous access and Authentication Control".

      4. Click Edit next to Basic authentication.

      5. Use one of the following steps, as appropriate:

          - If all your user accounts exist in one Windows NT domain, type that
            domain name in the Default Domain box.

-or-

          - If your user accounts are spread among multiple domains, it is
            easier to type "\" (without the quotation marks) in the Default
            Domain box. If you type "\" (without the quotation marks), OWA
            searches all of the trusted domains for the user name.

After you add a default domain, the users can gain access to OWA by just
supplying their user name and password, instead of typing
<domain>\<user_name>.

 - File-level antivirus scanning software. A file-level antivirus scanning
   utility that is actively scanning the Exchsrvr folder on the hard disk can
   also cause this error. This issue can also manifest itself as a blank screen
   in the Web browser, instead of as an error message.

   At a minimum, exclude the Exchsrvr\Mdbdata, Exchsrvr\Webdata, and
   Exchsrvr\Webtemp folders from file-level antivirus scans. If you do not
   exclude these folders, issues may occur with both OWA and MAPI clients. Refer
   to your antivirus software's documentation for instructions about how to
   exclude files and folders.

   If you are concerned about mail-related viruses in Exchange Server, obtain
   antivirus software that is "Exchange Server-aware." Exchange Server-aware
   software uses scanning methods for the Exchange Server store that are not
   damaging. Exchange Server-aware antivirus software uses the antivirus
   application programming interface (API) that is built into Exchange Server.

 - OWA is installed on Windows 2000. Users who log on to OWA from a computer
   that is running any Microsoft Windows operating system other than Windows
   2000 can gain access to OWA, but users who log on to OWA from a computer that
   is running Windows 2000 may receive a 401.1 error message.

   This issue can occur if OWA is installed on a computer that is running Windows
   2000 Server with Integrated Windows Authentication turned on as one of the
   authentication methods on the Exchange Server virtual directory.

   To resolve this issue, on the server that OWA is installed on, edit the
   Constant.inc file in the Exchsrvr\Webdata\Usa folder:

   1. Use Notepad to open the Constant.inc file.

   2. Under '--Other Strings--', locate the following line:

   bstrAuthTypesAccepted = "_BasicNTLMDPAMBS_BASIC"

   3. Change the line to read:

   bstrAuthTypesAccepted = "_BasicNTLMDPAMBS_BASICNegotiate"

   4. On the File menu, click Save.

   5. On the File menu, click Exit.

   If you use a computer that is running either Microsoft Windows 2000 Server and
   Internet Explorer 5 or Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional and Internet
   Explorer 5 to try to log on to Internet Information Service (IIS) 5.0, and
   Integrated Windows Authentication is enabled, a negotiation is performed to
   determine if the Kerberos protocol or Windows NT Challenge/Response will be
   used for authentication.

   If you use a computer that is running either Windows 2000 Server and Internet
   Explorer 5 or Windows 2000 Professional and Internet Explorer 5, the server
   variable AUTH_TYPE is set to Negotiate. When you use a computer that is
   running any other Windows operating system, the server variable is set to
   NTLM. OWA checks what this variable returns against the bstrAuthTypesAccepted
   value that is modified. This check ensures that the authentication type is
   acceptable before OWA allows a user to log on.

401.3 - Unauthorized Due to ACL on Resource:

This error is usually the result of not having the required NTFS security
permissions on a file or registry key. To determine if this error is the result
of not having the required NTFS security permissions:

1. Confirm that the Everyone group has at least the minimum permissions that are
   required on the folders in the following table. To view the permissions on a
   folder, open the properties of the folder, and then click the Security tab.
   If the Security tab is missing, the folder resides on a FAT partition. There
