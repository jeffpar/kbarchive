TITLE   :XADM: Message Tracking Error 5007 Caused by Missing *.Arc Files
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:winnt:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbusage

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0 System attendant (SA) may rapidly
generate many ASNxxxx.tmp files in the Exchsrvr\Tracking.log directory. At the
same time, it will be reporting numerous events similar to the following in the
Windows NT Event Viewer application log when message tracking has been enabled:

   Event ID: 5007
   Source: MSExchangeSA
   Description: An error occurred during the message tracking decode operation.

The SA processor utilization may be very high while the Microsoft Exchange
Message Transfer Agent (MTA) throughput seems low.

CAUSE
=====

There are several possible reasons for this behavior. The most likely cause is
when one or more of the *.Arc files are missing or corrupt. In Microsoft
Exchange Server version 4.0, the SA uses the *.Arc files to decode the message
tracking log data passed to the SA by the MTA. The *.Arc files are a set of
templates that describe the structure of ASN.1 encoding used in the logging data
passed by the MTA to the SA. Without the *.Arc files, the SA is unable to
proceed with the decoding of message tracking data, and thus logs the 5007
events.

RESOLUTION
==========

Verify that all eleven of the *.Arc files are present in the Exchsrvr\Bin
directory. The file names are:

   Directory of <drive>:\exchsrvr\bin

   07/15/96  12:30a                40,900 ACSE.ARC
   07/15/96  12:30a                 7,560 BIND.ARC
   07/15/96  12:30a                 2,704 COMMON.ARC
   07/15/96  12:30a                91,970 EAI.ARC
   07/15/96  12:30a                17,577 P1.ARC
   07/15/96  12:30a                24,005 P3.ARC
   07/15/96  12:30a                43,795 P7.ARC
   07/15/96  12:30a                20,979 RDI.ARC
   07/15/96  12:30a                11,007 ROSE.ARC
   07/15/96  12:30a                23,790 X400COM.ARC
   07/15/96  12:30a                 1,301 X500DUM.ARC

These files are static and should not change in size or date. If any of the files
are missing, you can replace them by copying the necessary *.Arc files from
another Microsoft Exchange Server. In addition, if any of the file sizes do not
match, or the files appear to have become corrupted, they should be copied from
a Server that is not logging the 5007 events.

Another possible reason for this behavior is heap corruption caused by the SA.
This was a problem in the original release of Microsoft Exchange Server version
4.0 but has been fixed in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
