   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2 introduces a new DLL file (Passfilt.dll)
that lets you enforce stronger password requirements for users. Passfilt.dll
provides enhanced security against "password guessing" or "dictionary attacks"
by outside intruders.

NOTE: While Windows 95 does not support case-sensitivity in its passwords, the
password change request is sent to the Primary Domain Controller (PDC)in such a
way that it can enforce the password filtering rules. For example, if you change
your domain password on a computer running Windows 95 to PassWord1, you can use
password1, PASSWORD1, PassWord1, and so on to log on to the domain from a
computer running Windows 95. However, you must use PassWord1 to log on to a
computer running Windows NT.

NOTE: Passwords changed in Windows 3.x or Windows for Workgroups 3.x cannot be
enforced in this password policy.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The Passfilt.dll file implements the following password policy:

1. Passwords must be at least six (6) characters long.

2. Passwords must contain characters from at least three (3) of the following
   four (4) classes:

      Description                             Examples
      -------------------------------------------------------------------

      English upper case letters              A, B, C, ... Z
      English lower case letters              a, b, c, ... z
      Westernized Arabic numerals             0, 1, 2, ... 9
      Non-alphanumeric ("special characters") such as punctuation symbols

3. Passwords may not contain your user name or any part of your full name.

These requirements are hard-coded in the Passfilt.dll file and cannot be changed
through the user interface or registry. If you wish to raise or lower these
requirements, you must write your own .dll and implement it in the same fashion
as the Microsoft version that is available with Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2.

How to Install Strong Password Filtering
----------------------------------------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To ensure Strong Password functionality occurs throughout your domain structure,
make the following changes on all primary domain controllers (or stand-alone
servers, where needed).

Passfilt.dll is not necessary on backup domain controllers since the PDC is the
only machine where changes to the domain accounts database are made. However, it
should be installed on all BDCs because they can be promoted to PDC. If a BDC
without Passfilt.dll is promoted to PDC, then strong password enforcement will
be lost but there will be no other adverse effects.

1. Install the latest Windows NT 4.0 service pack.

2. Copy Passfilt.dll to the %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32 folder.

3. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

4. Locate and click the following key in the registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa

5. If there is not a value called Notification Packages, then on the Edit menu
   click Add Value, and then add the following Value:

   Notification Packages

   This value should be a data type of REG_MULTI_SZ.

   NOTE: If the Notification Packages value already exists, proceed to the next
   step.

6. Double-lick the Notification Packages value.

7. In the Data section there should be a value of FPNWCLNT. Create a new line,
   and then type "PASSFILT" (without the quotation marks).

8. Quit Registry Editor.

9. Restart the computer.

Microsoft Windows 2000
----------------------

Strong Password Functionality Included with Microsoft Windows 2000:

The functionality described above for the Passfilt.dll file for Windows NT 4.0
has been included in the operating system security components for Windows 2000.
You can enable strong password enforcement in Windows 2000 by starting the Local
Computer Policy snap-in and enabling the "Passwords must meet complexity
requirements" setting in Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security
Settings\AccountPolicies\Password Policy.
