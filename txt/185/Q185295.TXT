SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the output generated from the Microsoft Source Profiler
and specifically focuses on the use of function timing. The sample output comes
from a default MFC AppWizard-based application called ProfTest. Although it is
not a complete listing of the output from this profile, it is sufficient to
demonstrate the output results. A description of each entry presented in the
"Sample Output" section follows in the "Output Description" section of this
article.

Output Description
------------------

Program Statistics:

Command line -

   Time and date the application ran, and the complete command line issued by
   the profiler.

Total time -

   Total application execution time. The time listed in milliseconds might not
   be completely accurate. Use the times as a relative measure.

Time outside of functions -

   Time spent outside of any profiled functions. If a top level profiled
   function is called, no time is added to this value until that function
   returns.

Call depth -

   The deepest level of functions called. For example, if function A calls
   function B which calls function C, the call depth is 3.

Total functions -

   The number of functions listed in the output.

Total hits -

   How many times the functions listed were executed.

Function coverage -

   The percentage of time spent in the listed functions.

Overhead calculated -

   A relative value that represents profiler overhead. This is not a measure of
   time, but a larger value indicates more time spent in overhead.

Overhead average -

   The average overhead required for all profiles. This should be the same as
   the overhead calculated, unless you are merging multiple profiles.

Module Statistics:

These statistics are similar to the Program Statistics. They are useful when
profiling multiple modules, such as an executable and dynamic link library.

Function Time:

In the Function Timing section of the Visual C++ online documentation, there is
one error. The function time is in milliseconds, not seconds as it is stated in
the documentation. The following excerpt is reprinted from the documentation
with the correct measure for function time (milliseconds):

   The Func Time column reports how much time it took for the function to run in
   milliseconds. The next column shows what percent of the total profile time is
   represented by the function time. Func+Child Time refers to the total time
   profiled for the function as well as any functions called by that function.
   The next column shows what percent of the total profile time is represented
   by the Func+Child time. The Hit Count column reports the number of times that
   the function was called. The Function column displays the decorated name of
   the function.

If a called function contains profiler information, then the Func+Child Time is
greater than the Func Time.
