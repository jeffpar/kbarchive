SUMMARY
=======

It is a common practice in high-traffic network environments to replace
traditional Ethernet network hubs with intelligent switches. While this can
improve computer and network performance, it makes tracing network traffic
between computers difficult. An Ethernet switch works by directing packets to a
specific MAC Address associated with the port. Because of this, when you try to
use a network analyzer (such as Microsoft Network Monitor) in this environment,
only packets with the analyzer computer's MAC address or broadcasts appear in
the trace. This article describes two common methods for working around this
behavior.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To work around this behavior, it is necessary to arrange or configure the
network so that the analyzer computer can receive all the necessary network
traffic. There are two common methods for achieving this without re-engineering
the entire network:

Method 1
--------

This method is not available on all switches. Some switches allow for a port to
be "attached" to the internal communications channels in the device. This port
will now receive all traffic passing through the switch. Note that some
manufacturers refer to this configuration as a Mirror Port.

Method 2
--------

You can use a non-switched hub in conjunction with the switch. The hub will
require a "crossover" or "uplink" port (or a suitably wired cable), which will
be used to connect back to the switch.

The target computer and analyzer computer are both connected to the hub, which is
connected back to the switch. Now, the analyzer will receive all traffic for the
target, as well as its own.

NOTE: In making this change, it is also necessary to check data rates (10/100 or
Gigabit networking) to ensure that all devices are compatible and will
communicate successfully.

Method 3
--------

Install Network Monitor on both endpoint systems. Start capturing simultaneously
on both systems, immediately perform the test required, and then stop the
capturing.

Tracing in this manner shows the packets from the sending machine. You can then
compare this trace to the trace of the receiving machines in order to discover
if packets are received, not received or possibly duplicated at the endpoint.
Duplication of packets has been seen in switched environments.
