Manually Assign Actions
-----------------------

To manually assign an action to a button or axis on your game controller:

1. Start a new flight in Flight Simulator 2000.

2. On the Options menu, point to Controls, and then click Assignments.

3. To assign events to the buttons on your game controller, click the
   Buttons/Keys tab.

   To assign events to the axes on your game controller, click the "Joystick
   axes" tab.

4. In the "Joystick type" box, click the game controller you want to use.

5. Under the Event column, click to select the line for an event you want to
   assign to a button or an axis on your game controller, and then click "Change
   assignment."

6. On the game controller, press the button or move the axis you want to use for
   the selected action.

   If you receive a warning message that a different action is already assigned
   to the game controller button or axis, click the green check mark to accept
   the new assignment, or click Clear to select a different button.

7. When you finish manually assigning events to the buttons and axes on your
   game controller, click the green check mark.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Calibrate as a Different Device
-------------------------------

Use the Game Controllers tool in Control Panel to configure your game controller
as a different device.

NOTE: You cannot configure any Microsoft SideWinder gaming device except the
SideWinder Standard or the SideWinder 3D Pro as a different device.

For example, to configure a SideWinder 3D Pro joystick as a 3-axis 4-button
joystick with Rudder/Pedals:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Game Controllers, and then click Microsoft SideWinder 3D Pro.

3. Click Remove, and then click Yes.

4. Click Add, click 3-Axis, 4-Button Joystick, and then click OK.

5. Click Properties.

6. On the Settings tab, click to select the Rudder/Pedals check box.

7. Click Calibrate, and then follow the instructions on the screen to calibrate
   the game controller.

   NOTE: Axis 3 is the throttle control, and axis 4 is the rudder control.

8. Click Test to verify that the game controller functions properly.

9. When you finish calibrating and testing the game controller, click OK, and
   then click OK again.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Reduce Sound Playback Quality
-----------------------------

If your sound card is unable to properly process game port signals and high
quality game sounds at the same time, you may be able to work around the issue
by reducing the sound playback quality in the game. To do this:

1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click "Files or Folders."

2. In the Named box, type "fs2000.cfg" (without the quotation marks).

3. In the "Look in" box, click My Computer, and then click Find Now.

4. In the list of found files, double-click the Fs2000.cfg file.

5. If you are prompted to select the program you want to use to open the file,
   click Notepad in the "Choose the program you want to use" box, and then click
   OK.

6. Scroll to the end of the file, press ENTER twice, and then type the following
   lines, pressing ENTER after you type each line:

   [SOUND]
   Channels=1
   SamplesPerSec=11025

7. On the File menu, click Exit. When you are prompted to save the changes,
   click Yes.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

   Simulator 2000 is installed.

9. Quit all unnecessary programs that are running on your computer. To do this,
   use the appropriate method for your version of Microsoft Windows.

Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft Windows 98, or Microsoft Windows
   Millennium Edition (Me):

Obtain and Install Updated Device Drivers
-----------------------------------------

If you are using version 1.0 of the SideWinder Game Device Software, download and
install the latest version of the SideWinder Game Controller software from the
following Microsoft Web site:

   http://www.microsoft.com/sidewinder

To determine the version of the SideWinder Game Device or SideWinder Game
Controller software installed in your computer:

1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click "Files or Folders."

2. In the Named box, type "sw3dpro.vxd" (without the quotation marks).

3. In the "Look in" box, click My Computer, and then click Find Now.

4. In the list of found files, right-click the Sw3dpro.vxd file, and then click
   Properties.

   NOTE: If the Sw3dpro.vxd file is not in the list of found files, the
   SideWinder software is not installed.

5. On the Version tab, note the value on the File Version line, and then click
   OK.

6. Close the Find: Files Named Sw3dpro.vxd window.

In addition, if your game controller is connected to the game port in your sound
card, contact the manufacturer of your sound card to inquire about how to obtain
and install the latest version of the sound driver for your sound card.

For information about how to contact the manufacturer of your sound card, click
the appropriate article number in the following list to view the article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q65416 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, A-K

   Q60782 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, Q-Z

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Configure the Sound Card to Use Only One DMA Channel
----------------------------------------------------

If your game controller is connected to the game port in your sound card, your
game controller may perform better if you configure the sound card to use only
one DMA channel.

NOTE: Some programs are unable to run with only one DMA channel. If you
experience this issue, restore your original sound card settings.

To configure a legacy sound card driver on a Microsoft Windows 95/98-based
computer or a native sound card driver on a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0-based
computer to use single-mode DMA:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Multimedia.

3. On the Devices or Advanced tab, click the PLUS SIGN (+) next to Audio Devices
   to expand the branch.

4. Click the sound card, and then click Properties.

5. Click Settings.

6. To configure the sound card to use single-mode DMA, see your sound card
   documentation, or use one of the following procedures:

    - Click to select the Use Single-Mode DMA check box, click OK until you
      return to Control Panel, and then restart the computer.

    - In the DMA Channel (16-bit) box, click Disable, click OK until you return
      to Control Panel, and then restart the computer.

    - In the High DMA box, click Use DMA, click OK until you return to Control
      Panel, and then restart the computer.

   If you cannot use the sound card driver to configure single-mode DMA, click
   Cancel until you return to Control Panel, and then proceed to the "Disable
   Force-Feedback Effects" method in this article.

To configure a native sound card driver on a Windows 95/98-based computer to use
single-mode DMA:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. Click the Device Manager tab.

4. Click the PLUS SIGN (+) next to "Sound, video and game controllers" to expand
   the branch.

5. Click the sound card, and then click Properties.

6. Click the Resources tab.

7. Under Resource Type, locate the Direct Memory Access (DMA) lines. If you see
   more than one Direct Memory Access (DMA) line, configure the sound card for
   single-mode DMA. To do this:

   a. Click to clear the Use Automatic Settings check box.

   b. In the Settings Based On box, click a Basic Configuration that uses only
      one DMA channel setting.

      If you see a conflict message in the Conflicting Device List box, repeat
      this step to select another basic configuration that uses only one DMA
      channel and does not conflict with any other devices.

      If you do not see a conflict message in the Conflicting Device List box,
      click OK, and then click Yes.

   c. Click Close, and then restart the computer.

   If you see only one Direct Memory Access (DMA) line, or if you cannot find a
   basic configuration that uses only one DMA channel, click Cancel, click
   Cancel again, and then proceed to the next method.

Disable Force-Feedback Effects
------------------------------

If you use a SideWinder Force Feedback Pro joystick or SideWinder Force Feedback
Wheel, disable the force-feedback effects. To do this:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Game Controllers.

3. Click to select Microsoft SideWinder Force Feedback Pro or Microsoft
   SideWinder Force Feedback Wheel.

4. Click Properties.

5. On the Settings tab, drag the Force Feedback slider to the Off position.

6. Click OK, and then click OK again.
