SUMMARY
=======

The Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit is available through a fulfillment
coupon included with the retail version of Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows,
version 2.0. This starter kit installs fonts for Windows-based applications
only; however, it can be merged with other starter kits to provide support for
multiple applications.

This article discusses problems and error messages you may encounter when using
the Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Common Problems
---------------

1. When trying to make fonts for Windows- and non-Windows-based applications,
   you may receive an error message stating that Windows fonts are not the same
   as non-Windows fonts made for the same printer.

   In some cases, fonts for Microsoft Windows and non-Windows applications cannot
   be made simultaneously, even though the fonts are for the same laser printer.
   This is because non-Windows-based applications require fonts in a different
   form for that printer. Make the fonts for Microsoft Windows, then make the
   fonts for non-Windows-based applications.

2. When you make fonts with the Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit, not all the
   phases can be completed.

   The system may be out of memory. Check the Fontware error log for this "make
   fonts" session to see if this is the case. If it is, there may be
   memory-resident programs or device drivers loaded in the system that you can
   remove temporarily. Make backup copies of the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
   files, edit the original files to increase the amount of free memory, then
   reboot the computer under this new configuration.

3. The Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit never asks for disk 2 of the
   Bitstream Scalable Typeface Package.

   Some files in the Bitstream Scalable Typeface Package may not be needed,
   depending on the devices selected when Fontware was set up. If the kit
   doesn't need disk 2 of the Bitstream Scalable Typeface Package, it won't ask
   for it.

4. The Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit cannot be used to install Bitstream
   SoftFonts.

   Although SoftFonts and Fontware are both made by Bitstream, they are separate
   products. SoftFonts should be installed using the SoftFont Installer provided
   with the Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet printer driver.

Error Messages
--------------

1. After you press F10 to make fonts, the following error may occur:

   Time and Space Estimates. Not enough disk space available

   Delete some font requests and check the estimates again. The Bitstream
   Fontware Installation Kit (FIK) has checked the available disk space against
   its space estimates and determined that there is not enough room on the disk.

2. When you are making fonts, the following error may occur:

   Some typeface information missing. Go to Add/Delete Bitstream Fontware
   Typefaces

   You selected a typeface that the Bitstream Fontware Installation Kit does not
   find on the system, even though the name is listed in the Make Fonts Windows.
   This may happen if both a PostScript PDL and a non-PostScript PDL printer are
   installed and the typeface was added before setting up Fontware support for
   the PostScript PDL printer. Choose Add/Delete Bitstream Fontware Typefaces,
   and add the typeface again. Then make the fonts.

   If you are attempting to make PostScript PDL fonts from the free Dutch and
   Swiss typefaces, the same error message may occur. Times Roman and Helvetica
   are resident on most PostScript PDL printers; the files needed for Dutch and
   Swiss PostScript PDL fonts are not shipped with the starter kit. Either
   purchase Bitstream Scalable Typeface Packages for Dutch and Swiss, or select
   Times Roman and Helvetica in the Windows application.

3. If you request point sizes for a Symbol typeface, the following message may
   occur:

   This typeface requires a different character set. Go to the Control Panel and
   select a different character set

   Go to the Fontware Control Panel and select one of the symbol character sets
   available to make fonts for the device(s). Symbol typefaces require special
   symbol character sets.

4. When adding typefaces in Fontware the following message may occur:

   Warning: Those typefaces that were copied may not be usable for making
   PostScript PDL Printer fonts

   This means that ESC was pressed before adding the second typeface disk that
   contains information Fontware needs to make fonts for PostScript PDL
   printers. Try adding the typeface again.

5. When setting up Fontware and adding a typeface, the following message may
   occur:

   Unable to copy all typeface information. Errors occurred while copying
   typefaces.

   This message is generated when the Fontware kit is unable to read from the
   disk it is trying to copy. If using a backup of a Fontware Installation Kit
   disk or a Bitstream Scalable Typeface disk, exit the kit, make a new backup
   copy, and try again. If the disk is an original typeface disk, obtain a
   replacement disk.

6. The following message may occur when you enter the Fontware directory name
   while running the Fontware Setup program.

   Unable to make this directory. Choose a different directory

   You have entered a directory name that the kit cannot create on the hard disk.
   Press ESC and enter a different directory name. This may indicate a general
   problem with writing to the hard disk, or may be the name of a file that
   already exists. (Note that Fontware will not accept any directory name that
   MS-DOS does not accept as a directory name.)

7. When exiting Fontware during setup, the following message may occur:

   Warning: Aborting the setup process at this stage may leave your Fontware
   directory in an unusable state, requiring a complete reinstallation of
   Fontware. Do you want to abort setup?

   This message occurs only after Fontware has begun copying files. The Fontware
   Setup program is not completed at the time of exiting Fontware because some
   files may be in an unusable state on the hard disk. Fontware for Microsoft
   Windows may need to be reinstalled. If Fontware for non-Windows-based
   applications is set up in the same Fontware directory, Fontware for those
   applications may also need to be set up.
