SUMMARY
=======

This article demonstrates how to:

 - Export an instantiation of a Standard Template Library (STL) class.

 - Export a class that contains a data member that is an STL object.

Note that you may not export a generalized template. The template must be
instantiated; that is, all of the template parameters must be supplied and must
be completely defined types at the point of instantiation. For instance
"stack<int>;" instantiates the STL stack class. The instantiation forces
all members of class stack<int> to be generated.

Also note that some STL containers (map, set, queue, list, deque) cannot be
exported. Please refer to the More Information section to follow for a detailed
explanation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Beginning with Visual C++ 5.0, it is possible to force an instantiation of a
template class and export the instantiation. To export a template class
instantiation, use the following syntax:

To Export an STL Class
----------------------

1. In both the DLL and the .exe file, link with the same DLL version of the C
   run time. Either link both with Msvcrt.lib (release build) or link both with
   Msvcrtd.lib (debug build).

2. In the DLL, provide the __declspec specifier in the template instantiation
   declaration to export the STL class instantiation from the DLL.

3. In the .exe file, provide the extern and __declspec specifiers in the
   template instantiation declaration to import the class from the DLL. This
   results in a warning C4231 "nonstandard extension used : 'extern' before
   template explicit instantiation." You can ignore this warning.

To Export a Class Containing a Data Member that Is an STL Object
----------------------------------------------------------------

1. In both the DLL and the .exe file, link with the same DLL version of the C
   run time. Either link both with Msvcrt.lib (release build) or link both with
   Msvcrtd.lib (debug build).

2. In the DLL, provide the __declspec specifier in the template instantiation
   declaration to export the STL class instantiation from the DLL.

   NOTE: You cannot skip step 2. You must export the instantiation of the STL
   class that you use to create the data member.

3. In the DLL, provide the __declspec specifier in the declaration of the class
   to export the class from the DLL.

4. In the .exe file, provide the __declspec specifier in the declaration of the
   class to import the class from the DLL.

   If the class you are exporting has one or more base classes, then you must
   export the base classes as well. If the class you are exporting contains data
   members that are of class type, then you must export the classes of the data
   members as well.

NOTE: Some STL classes use other STL classes. These other classes must also be
exported. The classes that must be exported are listed in compiler warnings if
you compile with a warning level lower than 1; that is, /W2, /W3, or /W4.
Warning level 4 generates a lot of warning messages for STL headers and is not
currently recommended for that reason.

Some STL classes contain nested classes. These classes can not be exported. For
instance, deque contains a nested class deque::iterator. If you export deque,
you will get a warning that you must export deque::iterator. If you export
deque::iterator, you get a warning that you must export deque. This is caused by
a designed limitation that once a template class is instantiated, it can not be
re-instantiated and exported. The only STL container that can currently be
exported is vector. The other containers (that is, map, set, queue, list, deque)
all contain nested classes and cannot be exported.

When you export an STL container parameterized with a user-defined type (UDT),
you must define the operators < and == for your UDT. For example, if you
export vector<MyClass>, you must define MyClass::operator < and MyClass
operator ==. This is because all STL container classes have member comparison
operators that require the existence of the operators < and == for the
contained type. Normally, these are not instantiated because they are not used.
When you instantiate an instance of a template class, all member functions are
generated. Because the STL container classes have member functions that use the
operators < and == for the contained type, you must implement them. If
comparing objects of your UDT does not make sense, you can define the comparison
operators to simply return "true."

When the symbol _DLL is defined during compiling (this symbol is implicitly
defined when compiling with /MD or /MDd to link with the DLL version of the C
Runtime), the following STL classes, and various global operators and functions
that operate on these classes, are already exported by the C Runtime DLL.
Therefore, you cannot export them from your DLL. This should not cause a problem
for the executable program that imports your class as long as it also uses the
DLL version of the C run time:

Header      STL template class
------------------------------
<IOSFWD>    basic_ios
<IOSFWD>    <IOSFWD>
<IOSFWD>    basic_istream
<IOSFWD>    basic_string (also typedef'd as string and wstring)
<IOSFWD>    complex
<LOCALE>    messages
<XLOCALE>   codecvt
<XLOCALE>   ctype
<XLOCMON>   moneypunct
<XLOCMON>   money_get
<XLOCMON>   money_put
<XLOCNUM>   numpunct
<XLOCTIME>  time_get
<XLOCTIME>  time_put
<XSTRING>   basic_string (also typedef'd as string and wstring)

For specific details on which template parameters are used and which global
functions and operators are declared, please see the relevant header file.

       #include <vector>

       // Provide the storage class specifier (extern for an .exe file, null
       // for DLL) and the __declspec specifier (dllimport for .an .exe file,
       // dllexport for DLL).
       // You must define EXP_STL when compiling the DLL.
       // You can now use this header file in both the .exe file and DLL - a
       // much safer means of using common declarations than two different
       // header files.
       #ifdef EXP_STL

       // Instantiate classes vector<int> and vector<char>
       // This does not create an object. It only forces the generation of all
       // of the members of classes vector<int> and vector<char>. It exports

       // data member of an STL object.
       // Note that the two template instantiations above are required for
       // the data members to be accessible. If the instantiations above are
       // omitted, you may experience an access violation.
       // Note that since you are exporting a vector of MyClass, you must
       // provide implementations for the operator < and the operator ==.
