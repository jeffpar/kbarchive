lists new features added in the service pack and articles describing the
symptoms and causes for problems fixed in the service pack.

NOTE 1: The SNA Server 4.0 SP1 includes updates to the SNA Server, Print
Service, COM Transaction Integrator, SNA OLE/DB Interface, TN3270 Service,
TN5250 Service, ODBC drivers, AFTP, and Shared Folders Gateway.

NOTE 2: The SNA Windows 95 and Windows NT client refresh setup programs
will attempt to invoke the MMC and/or MSDAC installation programs if the
SNA MMC Snap-In, ODBC-DRDA Driver, COM Transaction Integrator or OLE DB
Provider are chosen. While these separate installation programs exist on
the SNA Server 4.0 SP1 CD, they are not included in the electronic download
images and must be downloaded separately. For instructions, see the
"Instructions for Decompressing the Client Refresh Files" below.

Instructions for Decompressing the Client Update Files
------------------------------------------------------

All of the above files are Win32 self-extracting executables.  The SNA
Server and client update programs automatically extract and run the Update
program. For these Update programs to run automatically, the server or
client machine must have the following free disk space:

  Server Update (Intel) - 40SP1IS.EXE:  67 MB
  Server Update (Alpha) - 40SP1AS.EXE:  84 MB
  Windows NT Client Update (Intel) - 40SP1ICU.EXE: 50 MB
  Windows NT Client Update (Alpha) - 40SP1ACU.EXE: 63 MB
  Windows 95 Client Update         - 40SP195U.EXE: 15 MB

When running Update automatically, please note the following:

- before update is run, all files are automatically extracted to the
  directory where the TMP, TEMP, or WINROOT environment variable is
  pointing (trying in that order). So, if the SET command shows that
  TMP=C:\TMP , and C: does not have sufficient storage to extract the
  files, change TMP to point to a drive which has sufficient space.
  For example:

    SET TMP=D:\TEMP

- to extract the files into a separate directory without running update
  automatically, run the service pack update file using the /x option.
  For example:

    40SP1IS /x

The SNA Server Windows 3.x client files (40SP1CLU.EXE, 40SP1CLR.EXE) are
Win32 self extracting executables that cannot be run directly from a
Windows 3.x machine. The administrator must first run the refresh file and
choose a directory to place the extracted files. Windows 3.x clients may
then connect across the network and run the Update program to apply the
service pack files.

Instructions for Decompressing the Client Refresh Files
-------------------------------------------------------

The SNA Server client refresh files (40SP1ICR.EXE, 40SP1ACR.EXE,
40SP195R.EXE, 40SP1CLR.EXE) include the SNA Server client code, which
already includes all 4.0 SP1 files. These refresh files each extract into a
user-defined directory, though the setup program is not run automatically.
If the SNA Windows 95 or Windows NT client setup programs are run and one
of the following options are chosen:

- SNA MMC Snap-In
- ODBC-DRDA Driver
- COM Transaction Integrator
- OLE DB Provider

then the MMC_MDAC.EXE file must also be downloaded and extracted, since the
SNA client setup program will attempt to launch external installation
programs for MMC and MSDAC. While the MMC and MSDAC files are included on
the SNA 4.0 SP1 CD, they are not included in the SNA client refresh
electronic download images.

Follow these instructions if one or more of the above features are to be
chosen within the SNA client setup program:

1) Extract MMC_MDAC.EXE to a user-defined directory. For example:

     D:\REFRESH

   This will create the following subdirectories:

     D:\REFRESH\MMC
     D:\REFRESH\MSDAC

2) Extract the SNA Windows 95 client refresh (40SP195R.EXE) to
   a directory which is 2 directories below the MMC_MSDAC
   subdirectory location. For example, if the MMC and MDAC files
   were extracted to D:\REFRESH, then the Windows 95 client files
   should be extracted to:

     D:\REFRESH\WIN95\RETAIL

   The Windows 95 setup program may then be run from the
   D:\REFRESH\WIN95\RETAIL directory.

3) Extract the SNA Windows NT client refresh (40SP1ACR.EXE or
   40SP1ICR.EXE) to a directory which is 3 directories below the
   MMC_MSDAC location.  For example, if the MMC and MDAC files
   were extracted to D:\REFRESH, then the Windows NT client files
   should be extracted to:

     D:\REFRESH\WINNT\I386\RETAIL

   * or *

     D:\REFRESH\WINNT\ALPHA\RETAIL

   The Windows NT client setup program may then be run from the
   appropriate D:\REFRESH\WINNT\<platform>\RETAIL directory

In step #2 and #3 above, the MMC and MSDAC directories must exist at the
relative subdirectory levels mentioned above. The directory names are not
relevant.

SNA Server 4.0 SP1 includes the Microsoft Data Access Components for
Windows 95 and Windows NT, version 1.5c. For more information about the
Microsoft Data Access Components, see the README.TXT file within the
<extraction-dir>\MSDAC directory.

Installing the Service Pack Files
---------------------------------
Both the SNA Server and SNA client files have been updated in 4.0 SP1.
Updates may be applied in any order -- to the server and/or to the clients.
It is recommended that all systems running SNA Server 4.0 (that is, SNA
Servers and client computers) are updated to 4.0 SP1. It may not be
necessary to update the client computers to SP1 unless you are experiencing
a client problem that has been fixed in SP1.

WARNING: This service pack update is intended to be applied on systems
currently running SNA Server 4.0 server or client software.  These updates
should NOT be applied over systems running SNA Server 3.x or 2.x releases.

** TO BE APPLIED TO SNA SERVER 4.0 SYSTEMS ONLY!! **
