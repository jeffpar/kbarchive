Changes to the Documentation
This section updates the Index Server documentation for the following topics:

Indexing a Newly Created Web Site 
Running Webhits Out of the IIS Process 
Indexing a Newly Created Web Site
When you create a new Web site through Internet Information Server (IIS), the site is not indexed by default, and therefore you cannot search documents on that site with Index Server.

To index a new Web site

In left pane of Microsoft Management Console (MMC), right-click the newly created Web site. 
Click Properties on the menu. 
On the Home Directory property sheet, select Index this directory. 
Click OK. 
Next, you must add a catalog for the new site. To learn how to add a catalog, see Creating Catalogs in the main documentation.

Running Webhits Out of the IIS Process
The Index Server sample query forms configure the Webhits ISAPI application to run out of the IIS process, because ISAPI applications are generally configured to run out of process when they are untrusted. It's better to run untrusted applications out of process so that IIS is not affected if the application crashes. Webhits is configured in the Index Server samples to run out of process because it uses text filters (IFilter) to display query hits in files. Because text filters come from many companies, it's hard to guarantee they are all robust.

The filters that ship with Index Server have been thoroughly tested. These include the HTML, Microsoft Office, and text filters. If you haven't installed any third party filters, it's safe (and more efficient) to run Webhits in the IIS process on your Web server.

Internet Service Manager can configure virtual directories for running in or out of the IIS process. To configure Webhits to run in or out of process, edit the properties of the virtual directory in which the .htw files reside. Then, in the Directory property sheet, set the Run in separate memory space (isolated process) check box appropriately. By default, Index Server installs .htw file samples in the /IISsamples/ISsamples/Oop virtual directory.

If you cannot run Webhits in the IIS process, limitations in IIS impose restrictions on Webhits. For example, files in virtual directories on computers other than the Web server cannot be displayed using Webhits when Webhits is running out of the IIS process. Also, files with extensions not associated with an IFilter cannot be displayed with Webhits when Webhits is running out of the IIS process and when the registry parameter WebhitsDisplayScript is not set to 2.

You can work around these limitations, but the workaround compromises security for the Web server. Use this workaround only if security is not a significant concern for your installation. The workaround requires the administrator to do the following:

Enable anonymous access to the directory through Internet Service Manager. 
Configure an account that has administrative access as the default user for the directory. 
To configure a user account

Click Start, point to Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack, point to Microsoft Transaction Server, and click Transaction Server Explorer. 
In MMC, double-click the Microsoft Transaction Server folder. 
Open the Computers folder. 
Open My Computer (or the folder representing your Web server). 
Open Packages Installed. 
Right-click the package representing Iissamples/Issamples/Oop and click Properties on the menu to open the property sheet. 
On the Identity property sheet, type a user name and password in the User and Password boxes, and click OK. 
This account must have administrative privileges on the local computer.
