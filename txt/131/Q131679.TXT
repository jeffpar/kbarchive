SUMMARY
=======

Lack of memory is the most common cause of performance problems in computer
systems. When the memory requirements of the active processes exceed the
physical memory available on the system, the system starts paging (moving
portions of active processes to disk in order to reclaim physical memory). At
this point, performance decreases dramatically.

This article discusses memory usage and which Performance Monitor counters are
effective in detecting memory bottlenecks.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The single resource that consumes the most time during a task's execution is
that task's bottleneck. Bottlenecks can occur because resources are not being
used efficiently, resources are not being used fairly, or a resource is too slow
or too small.

A quick way to tell if a system is struggling for memory is to call up WINMSD.EXE
(located in %System Root%\system32) and look at the Memory dialog. This utility
details the total memory in the system, the current available memory ready for
allocation to applications started, available space within the page file, and
the Memory Load Index. The Memory Load Index specifies a number between 0 and
100 that gives a general idea of current memory utilization, in which 0
indicates no memory use and 100 indicates full memory use.

Using Performance Monitor
-------------------------

Performance Monitor is a graphical tool for measuring the performance of a
Windows NT based computer or other Windows NT based computers on a network.

It is located in the Administrative Tools group of both the Windows NT
Workstation and Windows NT Server products. On each computer, the behavior of
objects such as processors, memory, cache, threads, and processes can be viewed.
Each of these objects has an associated set of counters that provide information
on such things as device usage, queue lengths, and delays, as well as
information used for throughput and internal congestion measurements. It
provides charting, alerting, and reporting capabilities that reflect current
activity along with ongoing logging. Log files can be opened later for browsing
and charting to reflect current activity.

Before spending money to add more hardware or replace existing hardware, it i s
best to use Performance Monitor to first tune the system to make the most
efficient use of existing resources.

Memory - Pages/sec
------------------

Pages/sec is the number of pages read from the disk or written to the disk to
resolve memory references to pages that were not in memory at the time of the
reference. As a rule, assume that if the average of this counter is consistently
greater than five, then memory is probably becoming a bottleneck in the system.
Once this counter starts to average consistently at 10 or above, performance is
significantly degraded and disk thrashing is probably occurring.

Memory - Available Bytes
------------------------

Available Bytes displays the amount of free physical memory. If this counter
stays consistently below 1 MB on servers and 4 MB on workstations, paging is
occurring and performance is less than optimal.

Memory - Committed Bytes
------------------------

Committed Bytes displays the size of virtual memory (in bytes) that have been
committed (as opposed to simply reserved). If this counter is greater than the
amount of main memory, it indicates that main memory may not be large enough to
accommodate all functions of all currently active processes and some paging may
be inevitable. However, before making such an assumption, check Memory -
Pages/sec and Memory - Page Faults/sec. If the Memory - Pages/sec is greater
than 10 (10 is a reasonable guideline, but varies with disk hardware) and Memory
- Page Faults/sec is greater than Memory - Cache Faults/sec then there is too
much paging.

When Memory - Committed bytes approaches the Memory - Commit Limit and the page
file has already reached maximum page file size, there are simply no more pages
available, in main memory or in the page file. The Memory - Commit Limit is the
amount of virtual memory that can be committed without extending the page file.
If this occurs on a server running Windows NT Server, three errors in the Event
Log may show up. (EVENTVWR.EXE is located in the Administrative Tools group).
They are from the source:

2020: The server was unable to allocate from the system paged pool because the
pool was empty.

2001: The server was unable to perform an operation due to a shortage of
available resources.

2016: The server was unable to allocate virtual memory.

NOTE: If this occurs, it is generally related to a memory leak in another
process. To determine the process at fault, monitor each process's Page File
bytes or Working Set.

Another condition to be aware of is the following nonpaged pool error in the
server's Event Log:

2019: The server was unable to allocate from the system nonpaged pool because the
pool was empty.

Nonpaged pool pages cannot be paged out to the paging file, but instead remain in
main memory as long as they are allocated. By default, NonPagedPoolSize is
dynamically calculated as follows:

The system's nonpaged pool allocation can be monitored with the Memory Pool Non
Paged Bytes counter. If there is a shortage of nonpaged pool, the following
error may occur on a remote system or even the local system:

   Not enough storage available to process this command.

If this error occurs, start looking at each process's nonpaged pool allocation.
This is generally caused by an application incorrectly making system calls and
using up all allocated nonpaged pool.

Adding More Memory
------------------

To determine about how much memory to add, use the following formula:

   Paging File - % Usage - MAX * Page file size = number of bytes used.
   Add together the bytes used for all page files.

This is the amount of memory that would need to be added to allow all of the
applications to perform their operations with minimum paging. For example, if a
page file is 100 MB and the % Usage MAX is 20%, then add 20 MB additional

RAM to have a system that does minimal paging. The reason this formula only gives
an idea about how much memory to add is that a) not all page file "in use" code
is accessed all the time; and b) the formula ignores the requirements for code
and mapped files not backed by the paging file. Therefore this estimate is
neither an upper bound, nor a lower bound, it is only an "indication." The truth
is that there is no good way to know how much memory to add at this time. A more
accurate way to measure the amount of memory an application would require is to
run the application on a very large machine and measure the needs under some
slight memory pressure. (There is a tool in the Windows NT Resource Kit volume 3
utilities called Response Probe that can aid in this area.)

Adding memory without upgrading the secondary cache size sometimes degrades
processor performance. This is because the secondary cache now has to map the
larger memory space, usually resulting in lowered hit rates in the cache. This
slows down processor-bound programs because they are scattered more widely in
memory after memory has been added. (Secondary cache refers to the physical
cache memory chip(s) usually located on the motherboard, as opposed to within
the processor itself. In the future, processors will be built with secondary
cache on the same substrate as the processor chip, or even within the processor
chip itself.)
