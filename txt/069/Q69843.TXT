SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses error messages that may be returned when you run Lotus
1-2-3 version 3.1 from Microsoft Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following error messages may be returned when you run Lotus 1-2-3 version
3.1 from Windows 3.0 or 3.0a in real or standard mode or from later versions of
Windows in standard mode:

VM error[27]
------------

   VM error[27]: Not enough disk space for swap file
   "d:\XXXXXXXXX'" (where XXXXXXXXX is a file name)

This indicates that Lotus 1-2-3 has its swap file path set to a directory that
does not have sufficient space to create the swap file.

To work around the problem, try the following:

1. Specify the SET 123SWAPPATH statement (located in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file) to
   point to another drive that has sufficient space.

2. Reduce the amount of memory allocated for Lotus 1-2-3 by adjusting the SET
   123MEMSIZE statement to a lower value.

3. Back up and erase all nonessential files from the hard drive to provide more
   disk space for the swap file.

VM error[26]
------------

   VM error[26]: Cannot create swap file. Make sure the 123SWAPPATH statement in
   your AUTOEXEC.BAT file contains only existing directories and no diskette
   drives. "name= g:\XXXXXXXXX"

(where XXXXXXXXX is a filename)

This indicates that Lotus has its swap file path set to a directory that does not
exist.

To work around the problem, set the SET 123SWAPPATH statement (located in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file) to point to another drive that exists and has sufficient disk
space.

ENHANCED MODE
-------------

The following error message may be returned when Lotus 1-2-3 version 3.1 is run
from Windows in enhanced mode:

   Cannot load driver file xxxx
   Cannot initialize resident segments
   (where xxxx refers to the driver filename)

This indicates a low-memory situation and frequently occurs on computers
configured with two megabytes (MB) of RAM. Under these circumstances, the
following changes are recommended to ensure that there is ample available memory
to run Lotus 1-2-3.

To work around the problem:

1. Remove or reduce the size of SMARTDrive. Normally, 2 MBs is not enough memory
   to load program code in physical memory if SMARTDrive consumes too much RAM.
   If there is insufficient physical RAM and/or insufficient swap file space,
   MS-DOS applications (that is, non-DPMI applications) will not be able to load
   into memory. It's better to run a program slower (that is, without caching
   support) rather than not having enough memory to run it at all.

2. Ensure that there is sufficient swap file space. For more information about
   swap file, query on:

   enhanced and mode and 2 mb

3. Use the standard PIF settings from either the 123.PIF, supplied with Lotus,
   or the _DEFAULT.PIF, supplied with Windows. Lotus 1-2-3 must have at least
   64K of XMS memory available to run.

4. Verify that the SET statements included in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file are correct.
   Because Lotus 1-2-3 3.1 has both DPMI and virtual memory support, optional
   SET statements can be added to adjust the program's memory usage. The SET
   123MEMSIZE= statement (in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file) controls the total memory
   consumption (physical and virtual memory) by Lotus 1-2-3. This should not
   exceed the amount of memory available in Windows.

Please refer to the "Setting Up 1-2-3" section in the "Lotus User Manual" for
more information on configuration, syntax on SET statements, and Windows-related
issues.
