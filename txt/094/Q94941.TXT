TITLE   :BUG: EXTERNDEF ABS Fails with Span Dependent Value
PRODUCT :Microsoft Macro Assembler
PROD/VER::6.0,6.0a,6.0b,6.1,6.11,6.1a
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b, 6.1, 6.1a, 6.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In an application developed with the Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), an
attempt to export a constant value with the EXTERNDEF directive fails.

CAUSE
=====

The exported value is defined in a macro as the difference between the values of
two labels (a span-dependent value).

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, perform one of the following two steps:

 - Modify the source code to specify the PUBLIC directive instead of the
   EXTERNDEF directive

 - Modify the source code of the macro to place a label before the value
   definition

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MASM versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b,
6.1, 6.1a, and 6.11. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following information is part of the README.TXT file distributed with MASM
version 6.1.

   Span-Dependent Equates in Macros and EXTERNDEF ABS
   --------------------------------------------------

   The ABS operator causes an identifier to be exported as a relocatable
   unsized constant (see Programmer's Guide page 220). If ABS is used with
   EXTERNDEF within a macro, and the constant being exported depends on the
   difference between two addresses, the constant may not be exported
   correctly. In some cases, the listing file will show the correct value,
   but the value in the resulting .OBJ will be incorrect. For example, the
   following code will not evaluate correctly:

      EXTERNDEF TableSize:ABS  ; Will not be exported correctly

      MAKETABLE MACRO
      Table1 LABEL BYTE
         DB 0, 1, 2
      TableSize EQU $-Table1
      ENDM

      SEG1 SEGMENT
      MAKETABLE
      SEG1 ENDS

   To avoid this problem, either use the 'PUBLIC' directive in place of
   'EXTERNDEF', or put a label before the equate, within the macro.

The code example below demonstrates this behavior. To see the problem,
build both modules with CodeView information and link them together.
Stepping through the program in the debugger to see the incorrect
TableSize value.

Sample Code Part 1
------------------

   ; Assemble options needed: /Zi
   ; link part 1 and part 2 together with /CO link option

   EXTERNDEF TableSize:ABS

   _text SEGMENT para public 'CODE'
   ASSUME cs:_text
   start:
      mov ax, TableSize
      mov ax, 4C00h
      int 21h
   _text ENDS

   END start

Sample Code Part 2
------------------

   ; Assemble options needed: /Zi

   EXTERNDEF TableSize:ABS ; Will not export correctly

   MakeTable MACRO
      Table1 LABEL BYTE
         DB 0, 1
      ;Table2 LABEL BYTE  ; Remove comment character to work around problem
      TableSize EQU $-Table1
   ENDM

   _data SEGMENT para public 'DATA'
      MakeTable
   _data ENDS

   END
