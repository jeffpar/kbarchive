SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Word provides a Calendar Wizard for creating calendars. The wizard
does not prompt you to modify character formatting such as font, point size, and
so forth. This article describes how you can use the Calendar Wizard to create
your own custom wizard.

NOTE: Microsoft does not support the modification of its wizards or templates.
Modifications done by the user are at the user's risk and constitute no
obligations or warranties, either written or expressed, by Microsoft.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create a new, modified calendar wizard, follow these steps.

NOTE: The Calendar Wizard is not installed when you do a complete installation of
Office or Word. It is available on the Office or Word CD-ROM in the
"\Valupack\Template\Word" folder. Copy the template from the CD-ROM to the
following folder on your hard disk drive: C:\Program Files\Microsoft
Office\Templates\Other Documents.

1. On the File menu, click Open. Change to the "\Program Files\Microsoft
   Office\Templates\Other Documents" folder or to the folder that contains the
   Calendar Wizard.

   In the Files Of Type list, select All Files. In the File Name list, select the
   Calendar Wizard and then click Open. On the File menu, click Save As and type
   a new name for the wizard. Any formatting changes you make will now be stored
   in your new wizard.

2. On the View menu, click Page Layout.

3. NOTE: The Calendar Wizard is composed of AutoText entries which correspond to
   the styles listed in the following table. Before you insert and modify an
   AutoText entry, change the page orientation to either portrait or landscape
   to correspond with the calendar style.

   To modify the page orientation, click Page Setup on the File menu, then select
   the Paper Size tab. Select Portrait or Landscape based on one of the
   following calendar styles:

   NOTE: The names of the AutoText Entries are listed in the columns labeled
   Portrait and Landscape.

4. On the Insert menu, point to AutoText, and then click AutoText. Select the
   AutoText tab. Choose the AutoText entry that corresponds to the calendar
   style you are creating, and then click the Insert button.

   NOTE: Each AutoText entry contains both drawing objects and text boxes. These
   drawing objects are visible only in page layout view or print preview. (You
   will see a blank page after you insert the AutoText entry if you are working
   in normal view.)

5. Click the Show/Hide button so that it is enabled, display table gridlines (on
   the Table menu, click Show Gridlines), and turn on Bookmarks (click Options
   on the Tools menu, select the View tab, click to select the Bookmarks check
   box, and then click OK).

   NOTE: Do not delete any of the bookmarks. If these are deleted, the wizard may
   not function properly.

6. Select the text or table cell in which you want to make changes (be sure the
   end-of-cell marker or paragraph mark is also selected). Make your formatting
   changes, such as changing the font or point size, adding bold or italics, and
   so forth. When finished, cancel the selection by clicking in the margin of
   the document.

7. On the Insert menu, point to AutoText, and then click AutoText. Select the
   AutoText tab. Select the AutoText entry that you previously selected in step
   4. Click Delete to delete the old AutoText entry. Click Close to return to
   the document.

8. Click the Drawing button on the Standard Toolbar to open the Drawing toolbar.

9. Click the Select Drawing Objects button on the Drawing Toolbar. Starting in
   the upper-left corner of the template, click and drag down and to the
   lower-right corner to enclose the entire document area. A dashed line appears
   as you are dragging to enclose the objects.

10. On the Insert menu, point to AutoText and then click AutoText. Select the
   AutoText tab. In the Enter AutoText Entries Here box, type the AutoText name
   using the same name as the AutoText entry you deleted in step 7 and click
   OK. In the "Look In" list, select the template you saved in step 1. Click
   Add and then click OK.

11. With the document still selected, click Cut on the Edit menu. You should now
   have a blank page with a single paragraph mark at the upper left of the
   page. If you have any text or more than a single paragraph mark, delete
   these items. Click Save on the File menu, and then close the template.

NOTE: The diskette version of Word does not contain the ValuPack folder. This
wizard, and many more for Word, may be downloaded from Microsoft's World Wide
Web site for free.
