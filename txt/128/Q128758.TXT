SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses how to play the games included with Magic School Bus
Explores the Solar System for Windows.

GAME DESCRIPTIONS
-----------------

The Planets Game (in the Classroom)
-----------------------------------

The Planets Game is activated by clicking the Globe on the table in the
classroom. Choose a fun planet by clicking it, then explore this fun planet by
clicking the objects on the screen. These planets are not real solar system
planets but are intended for fun exploration. To return to the main screen,
click the Earth in the lower-right corner of the screen. To return to the
classroom, click the Earth again.

The Science Experiment (on the Planet Surfaces)
-----------------------------------------------

On each planet surface, a small notepad (with or without a pencil on the cover)
appears near the kids. Clicking the notepad takes you to the science experiment
for that planet. Each experiment interactively explores topics that are related
to this planet and/or all the planets. Listen to Liz's explanation of the
experiment and click around.

NOTE: To get to the planet surface from the classroom:

1. Click the Bus.

2. Click the Planet Selector in front of the steering column.

3. Click the planet you want to visit.

4. The planet name appears in the planet selector. Click the planet name.

5. Click the Door.

The WhatsIt Game (on the Planet Surfaces)
-----------------------------------------

The WhatsIt game is located on each planet surface. A small satellite (the
WhatsIt) appears in the upper left or right corner of the screen. Clicking
WhatsIt takes you to the game for that planet. Press the SPACEBAR key to jump.
Run left or right by pressing the LEFT and RIGHT ARROW keys. Click the WhatsIt
while playing the game to quit the game and return to the planet surface.
Collect Jump Boots (marked "J") and Traction Boots (marked "T") to help you jump
and land on moving platforms. Collect Rocket Packs to defy gravity (press up
arrow button to fly) and Air Packs to extend your oxygen supply.

Object of WhatsIt Game
----------------------

The object of the WhatsIt Game is to collect the token (located in the last
screen of each WhatsIt game), return to the bus, and use the mouse to place the
token in the Token Slot to gain clues. These clues allow you to guess which
planet to go to in order to find Ms. Frizzle. You can collect the stars to
increase your score, although the scores are reset each time you win or quit the
WhatsIt game.

PLANET-SPECIFIC INFORMATION
---------------------------

Mercury
-------

Revolving Planets Science Experiment:

Planets revolve around the Sun at different speeds. This experiment compares the
difference in revolutions between Earth and Mercury. Each full revolution around
the Sun is symbolized by candles on a birthday cake. Click either planet to
begin. When you see the birthday cake, click it to see how many birthdays you
would have had on that planet (compare with the number you would have had on the
other planet).

Mercury's WhatsIt Game (Medium Gravity):

You must use the moving platforms to move two screens to the right. If you fall
in a hole or run out of air, you automatically restart. The lava does not hurt
you. TIP: The Jump Boots in the second screen are of great benefit on this
planet.

Venus
-----

Venus Blanket Science Experiment:

The carbon dioxide and other gases in Venus' atmosphere act like a blanket that
keep the Sun's heat from escaping. This experiment lets you try to keep the
Sun's heat from escaping the surface of Venus. Change the size of the carbon
dioxide (CO2) cloud by clicking it (three sizes). Change the size of the Sun by
clicking it (three sizes). Then click the Thermometer to test the CO2 blanket
you have created. For some fun, click the pizza paddle to fling the piece of
pizza onto the surface of Venus to test the temperature.

Venus' WhatsIt Game (Heavy Gravity):

You need the Jump Boots in the first screen. The token is two screens to the
right. The lava does not hurt you, but you automatically start over if you fall
in the holes. Use the platforms when they are available. TIP: On the small
platforms, it is easier to jump up and then use the arrow keys to move either to
the left or right.

Moon
----

Crater Creator Science Project:

This experiment allows you to make craters on the surface of the moon. Click the
Yellow Slingshot, Green Band, or Blue Hand to load a meteor. Click the Meteor to
change the size. Click the Yellow Slingshot to change the angle. Click the Green
Band to change the tension, then click the Blue Hand to shoot the meteor with
the slingshot.

Moon's WhatsIt Game (Light Gravity):

Follow the arrows. It is easiest to jump and then use the arrow keys to move in a
direction. You must use the stationary platforms to get up to the second level
and find the token. TIP: This one's easy!

Mars
----

Mars Match Science Challenge:

In this experiment you match the background picture (from Earth or Mars) to the
planet (Earth or Mars) that would be associated with that environment. Click
either planet to switch them and when you believe that the match is correct
choose OK. If you choose correctly, the pictures are colored. If you have chosen
incorrectly, you will receive an "X" and Liz gives you hints on how to make a
better choice next time. If you receive three Xs you must click Reset to
continue.

Mars' WhatsIt Game (Medium Gravity):

On the first screen you must push the single block toward the three stacked
blocks. Then jump on the single block and jump over the stacked blocks. Pick up
the Jump Boots and use the platforms to go up and onto the surface of Mars. Or
pick up the Rocket Pack and press the UP ARROW key (plus the LEFT and RIGHT
ARROW keys) to jet to the surface. Follow the arrows. TIP: Avoid the weight on
the surface.

Jupiter
-------

Pack and Fill Science Experiment:

Jupiter is the largest planet. This experiment lets you try to fill Jupiter up
using the other planets. Click the planet you want to use, then click the Red
Fill Handle. To pause or stop the filling, click the Handle again. The object is
to perfectly fill Jupiter with another planet. When you achieve the object, you
are rewarded with celebratory fanfare. To start over, click Jupiter or the Red
Dispenser.

Jupiter's WhatsIt Game (Heavy Gravity):

The lava does not hurt you but if you fall in the holes, you have to start over.
You should pick up the Jump Boots on the first screen. Your goal is three
screens to the right. TIP: You can walk up to the edge of the volcanoes and then
jump over them.

Saturn
------

Design O' Ring Science Experiment:

Saturn is easy to recognize because of its rings. This experiment lets you design
rings for Saturn. The Red Handle extends or retracts the arm. Click the bin
(rock, dust or ice) to dispense them around Saturn. Dispense unwanted or extra
material in the Recycler. When you have dispensed all your materials, Saturn
rotates with the ring(s) you have created. To start again, click Saturn.

Saturn's WhatsIt Game (Heavy Gravity):

BEWARE: The rocks are ice and therefore slippery. Time your jumps from floating
rock to floating rock. Pick up the Rocket Pack on the second screen and use the
UP ARROW key (plus LEFT and RIGHT ARROW keys) to operate. Follow the arrows.
TIP: The Rocket Pack uses oxygen at a faster rate.

Uranus
------

Tilt and Match Science Experiment:

Planets rotate at different speeds and angles. In this experiment, you try to
guess the angle at which different planets rotate. Click the Ball to start it
rotating. Click the Boot to change the angle of rotation. Then click the
planet(s) that you believe match the Ball's angle of rotation (HINT: Start the
ball spinning before you click on a planet). If you are correct, tinkly bells
herald your success. If you are incorrect, a horn sounds and you can try again.
When all the planets are spinning, you are finished.

Uranus' WhatsIt Game (Light Gravity):

Avoid the weights at the top of the first screen. Pick up the Jump Boots on the
second screen. Use the moving platforms to follow the arrows. TIP: The token is
actually one screen above your starting point. See if you can shortcut two
screens.

Neptune
-------

Planet Cut and Slice Science Experiment:

This experiment allows you to see what materials the planets are made of. Click
the planet you want to examine, then click the Green Scissors to cut the planet
in half. Now click the layers to see what they are made of. After you have cut
all the planets, you can click the scissors to start again.

Neptune's WhatsIt Game (Medium Gravity):

This game probably requires several tries; it looks easy, but is one of the
tougher levels. To win, you want to descend to the bottom screen -- let yourself
fall. Make a mental note as you drop as to where and on which screen the Air
Packs are located. At the platform, jump across to the Jet Pack. Use the UP
ARROW key (plus LEFT and RIGHT ARROW keys) to operate. Pick up all the Air Packs
as you ascend. Do not forget the Air Pack on the lowest level. The Rocket Pack
uses oxygen at a very fast rate. TIP: Collect all the stars for a personal high
score!

Pluto
-----

Pluto Loop Science Experiment:

An object, for example, the moon, a satellite and, in this case, the Magic School
Bus, has to be at the right speed and angle to stay in orbit. In this experiment
you try to put the bus in orbit around Pluto. Click the Flame to increase or
decrease the speed. Click the Green Ramp to choose the angle, then click the Bus
to send it into (and perhaps out of) orbit. Click Pluto to start again.

Pluto's WhatsIt Game (Light Gravity):

You need to get the Jump Boots that are two screens to the right. Use the moving
platform at the top of the first screen. Jump over the stack of blocks in the
second screen. Pick up the Jump Boots and follow the arrows. Careful timing is
needed to navigate on the small, moving platforms. After you've traveled all the
small moving platforms, do not be disheartened to find yourself falling back
into the first screen without having reached the token. Get back onto the moving
platform and use it to jump up into the screen above you. Timing is important on
this jump so be ready to try it again if you miss the token the first time. TIP:
Once you have the Jump Boots you can leap back over the stack of blocks and into
the first screen (shortcut to the token).
