 - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Print service (Snaprint.exe) may fail unexpectedly with an access
violation, causing all print sessions to end abnormally when the Request
Definite Response option is enabled for 3270 print sessions. When this problem
occurs, SNA Server may log the following event:

   Event ID: 624
   Source: SNA Server
   Description: Creating dump file SNADUMP.LOG for snaprint.exe

If Drwtsn32.exe is configured as the default debugger on the system, the
Drwtsn32.log file will indicate an access violation fault in function
MonitorThread. The log entry will appear similar to the following:

Application exception occurred:
        App: exe\snaprint.dbg (pid=546)
        When: 9/18/2001 @ 8:44:29.876
        Exception number: c0000005 (access violation)

NOTE: This problem does not occur in Host Integration Server 2000.

CAUSE
=====

A small timing window exists in the print server when the Request Definite
Response option is enabled for 3270 print sessions that results in the deletion
of an internal print job control block. This in turn results in an access
violation that terminates the print server service.

Due to the nature of the small timing window, the access violation is more likely
to occur on multiprocessor systems.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0 service pack that contains this
fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

   http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

+----------------------------------+
| File name   | Date       | Time  | 
+----------------------------------+
| Winvprt.dll | 11/02/2001 | 07:45 | 
+----------------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version
4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Request Definite Response option is selected in SNA Manager on the
Transparency/GDI tab of the 3270 Print Session's Properties dialog box. This is
an advanced option that should be enabled for applications that require a high
level of assurance that the print job completed. This feature allows the print
server to send a message to the host system to indicate that the print job
completed.
