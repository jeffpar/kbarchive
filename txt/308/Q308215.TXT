TITLE   :PRB: VFP ODBC Driver Causes Various Errors in Microsoft Products
PRODUCT :Microsoft FoxPro
PROD/VER::1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0,6.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbGrpDSFox kbDSupport

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft ODBC Driver for Visual FoxPro, versions 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 
 - Microsoft ODBC Driver for Visual FoxPro (Build 6.00.8281.00), versions 1.0, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft ODBC Driver for Visual FoxPro (Build 6.01.8629.01), version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Visual FoxPro ODBC driver to retrieve data, the following errors
may occur in various Microsoft products:

 - If using Visual FoxPro to retrieve data from a FoxPro table using the Remote
   View Designer, the following error occurs:

   Connectivity Error: [Microsoft] [ODBC Visual FoxPro Driver] Invalid cursor
   state.

 - If using Microsoft Access to link or import to the FoxPro table, the
   following error occurs:

   ODBC--Call Failed.

 - If accessing the FoxPro table using Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel, the
   following error occurs:

   General ODBC Error.

Followed by:

   Couldn't read this file.

This error assumes that Word and Excel are using the Microsoft Query interface to
retrieve the data.

CAUSE
=====

These errors occur because the System attribute is set at the computer's TEMP
folder. This error seems to occur only on Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, Microsoft
Windows 2000, and Microsoft Windows XP operating systems.

RESOLUTION
==========

From an MS-DOS prompt, issue the ATTRIB -S C:\WINNT\TEMP command to remove the
System attribute from the TEMP folder. This assumes that the C:\WINNT\TEMP
folder is the default for the TEMP and TMP environment variables. To determine
this, right-click the My Computer icon on the desktop, click Properties, click
Advanced, and then click Environment Variables. Look at the TEMP and TMP
variables in the System Variables list box to determine which folder the
variables are pointing to and then issue the ATTRIB command on this folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Using the MS-DOS ATTRIB command, set the System attribute for the TEMP
   folder. For example, the syntax for a folder called "temp" on drive C would
   be as follows:

   ATTRIB +S c:\temp

2. Create a data source name (DSN) in the ODBC Administrator using the Visual
   FoxPro ODBC driver and point it to a Visual FoxPro table or a database
   container.

3. Use the visual interface of any of the Microsoft products listed above to
   access the DSN that is pointing to the FoxPro table or database container.

4. After choosing the DSN, the error appears, and the data will not be
   retrieved.
