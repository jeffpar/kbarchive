SUMMARY
=======

This article demonstrates how to resize the Microsoft Rich Textbox control to
the size of its contents. For instance, it may be desirable to add a Rich
Textbox control to a Web page and have the control display its entire contents.
Another scenario would be to resize the control to either the height of the
contents or the height of a form.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This sample demonstrates how to intercept windows messages and check for a
specific message, EN_REQUESTRESIZE. This is accomplished by creating a message
handler (hook) and sending an event mask to the parent window. The event mask
tells the form what type of messages the control is sending. If you are
unfamiliar with message handlers, please see the "References" section of this
article.

WARNING: Failure to unhook a window before its imminent destruction results in
application errors, Invalid Page Faults, and data loss. This is due the fact
that the new WindowProc function being pointed to no longer exists, but the
window has not been notified of the change. Always unhook the sub-classed window
upon unloading the sub-classed form or exiting the application. This is
especially important while debugging an application that uses this technique
within the Microsoft Visual Basic Development Environment. Pressing the End
button or selecting End from the Run menu without unhooking causes an Invalid
Page Fault and closes Microsoft Visual Basic.

Sample Code
-----------

1. Start a new Visual Basic Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. On the Project menu, select Components. Check the Rich Textbox and Common
   Dialog controls, and then click OK.

3. Add a CommandButton, a CommonDialog, and a RichTextBox control to Form1.

4. In the Properties window, set the ScrollBars property of RichTextBox1 to
   "2-rtfVertical" (without the quotation marks).

5. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Form1:

   Option Explicit

   Private Sub Form_Load()
   ' Create a Hook and populate a global variable with the Richtextbox hwnd.
      Call NewWindowProc(Me.hWnd)
      RichWnd = RichTextBox1.hWnd
   End Sub

   Private Sub Command1_Click()
   ' Load a file into the richtextbox control
      With CommonDialog1
         .Filter = "All Files|*.*|Text Files|*.txt|RTF Files|*.rtf"
         .ShowOpen
         RichTextBox1.FileName = .FileName
      End With
   End Sub

   Private Sub Form_Resize()
   ' 1.)Populate global variables with the Height and Width of the 
   '   Richtextbox control.
   ' 2.)Set an event mask for the Richtextbox control.
   ' 3.)Send an EM_REQUESTRESIZE Message to the Form.

      gblWidth = RichTextBox1.Width / Screen.TwipsPerPixelX
      gblHeight = ((Form1.Height - RichTextBox1.Top) - 450) / _
                  Screen.TwipsPerPixelY
      Call SetMask(RichWnd)
      Call SendMessage(RichWnd, EM_REQUESTRESIZE, 0, 0)
   End Sub

   Private Sub Form_Unload(Cancel As Integer)
      Call ResetWindProc(Me.hWnd) ' Remove the Windows Hook
   End Sub

6. On the Project menu, select Add Module to add a BAS module to the project.
   Module1 is created by default.

7. Add the following code to General Declarations section of Module1:

   Option Explicit

               End If
   ' By modifying 2 of the above parameters you can create an endless bottom

      Call SendMessage(fhWnd, EM_SETEVENTMASK, 0, ENM_REQUESTRESIZE)
   End Sub

8. Save and run the project. Note that the control is now being displayed using
   the height of the contents or the height of the form.

9. Comment out the If statement described in the comments in Module1 of the code
   sample, and uncomment the SetWindowPos function call following it.

10. Save the project and run it. The RichTextBox control now resizes itself to
   the height of its contents regardless of the size of the contents.
