HTML-Based Internet Service Manager:

If Internet Explorer 2.0 is running on your desktop, you will be unable to
activate the HTML-based Internet Service Manager. Close all sessions of Internet
Explorer 2.0 and rerun HTML Internet Service Manager.

Using Internet Explorer 2.0 for MSN Authentication:

To access a site that requires MSN authentication, an administrator on the local
machine must have connected to any Web site using IE 2.0 at least once
previously. Otherwise, the error "Internet Explorer: This page cannot be opened
without authentication. Internet Explorer is not set up to use the required
method of authentication." will be displayed. If you receive this error, contact
your network administrator to do one of the following:

 - Obtain administrative rights to your local machine. Log on as an
   administrator and then use IE 2.0 to access any Web site.

   -or-

 - Ask the administrator of the local machine to run IE 2.0 once to connect to a
   Web site.

Microsoft Peer Web Services
---------------------------

Installing Peer Web Services on Windows NT Workstation Version 4.0:

Microsoft Peer Web services is a personal Web server that has been optimized to
run on Windows NT Workstation version 4.0. With Peer Web Services, you can
create a personal Internet server, which is ideal for development, testing, and
peer-to-peer publishing. As with Internet Information Server, Peer Web Services
supports all ISAPI extensions and filters. For more information about Internet
Information Server, see "Microsoft Internet Information Server" later in this
document.

After you have you installed Windows NT Workstation, you can install Peer Web
Services using the Network icon in Control Panel. If you already have the
necessary Internet or intranet connection, you can accept all of the default
settings during Setup and then add your Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) content
files to the \Wwwroot directory. Your files will be immediately available to
users. The default Setup configurations are suitable for many publishing
scenarios without further modifications.

To install Peer Web Services:

1. Insert the Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 compact disc into the CD- ROM
   drive.

2. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

3. Double-click the Network icon and then click the Services tab.

4. Click Add.

5. From the list of services, select Microsoft Peer Web Services, and then click
   OK.

6. Type the drive letter for the compact disc.

7. Follow the instructions on the screen.

For help with any Setup dialog box, click the Help button.

For more information about installation, see the Start Here book provided with
Windows NT Workstation version 4.0.

Where Is the Product Documentation?:

Documentation for Microsoft Peer Web Services is installed with the product and
is available online. After installing the product, you can open its Installation
And Administration Guide by clicking the Product Documentation icon in the
Microsoft Internet Server program group, or by running Internet Service Manager
and clicking Topics on the Help menu. You can also review the product
documentation before you install Peer Web Services by using a Web browser (such
as Microsoft Internet Explorer) to open the files directly from the Windows NT
Workstation compact disc.

To read the documentation, open the following file on the compact disc:

   \<platform>\Inetsrv\Htmldocs\Inetdocs.htm

where <platform> is Alpha, I386, Mips, or Ppc.

You must have a Web browser (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer) to view this
documentation. You can print chapters by using your Internet browser's Print
command. You will obtain the best printing results by using your browser's
default font size for text; for example, Medium in Internet Explorer and 12
points in Netscape Navigator.

Information about Peer Web Services is included in the Start Here book provided
with Windows NT Workstation version 4.0.

Removing TCP/IP:

If you remove the TCP/IP protocol, Peer Web Services cannot be removed by using
the Peer Web Services Setup icon To work around the problem and remove Peer Web
services, reinstall the TCP/IP protocol, and then remove Peer Web Services.

Support for Private Communication Technology (PCT):

Peer Web Services supports the PCT 2.0 specification, which is designed to secure
general-purpose business and personal communications on the Internet and
includes features such as privacy, authentication, and mutual identification.
PCT enhances Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) with technology developed for Secure
Transaction Technology (STT), particularly in authentication and protocol
efficiency. By separating authentication from encryption, PCT enables
applications to use authentication that is significantly stronger than the
40-bit key limit for encryption allowed by the U.S. government for export.
Microsoft's implementation of PCT is backward compatible with SSL.

Changes to User Configuration:

If changes to user configurations (such as adding or removing users from a group,
changing passwords, or changing NTFS permissions) do not take affect
immediately, try stopping and restarting the Internet services (WWW, FTP, and
gopher). Peer Web Services caches security tokens for all users. Changes to user
configurations will not appear until the security-token cache is cleared and the
new tokens are cached. The default caching interval is 15 minutes.

Product Home Page:

The HTML samples include a product home page (Default.htm) for Peer Web Services
that contains links to the product documentation, the Web-based server
administration tool, and to the Microsoft Web site.

If you already have a file named Default.htm in the Wwwroot directory, the setup
program will not replace your file with the product's default home page. You can
view the product home page by typing the following URL:

   http://<computername>/Samples/Default.htm

If you do not have a file named Default.htm in the Wwwroot directory, Setup
copies the file to the Wwwroot directory.

Publishing from Network Drives:

The FTP, gopher, and WWW services cannot publish from redirected network drives
(that is, from drive letters assigned to network shared folders).

To use network drives, you must use the server and share name (for example,
\\<Computername>\<Sharename>\Wwwfiles). If you require a user name
and password to connect to a network drive, all requests from remote users to
access that drive must be made with the user name and password you specified,
not the anonymous IUSR_<computername> account or another account you may
have specified.

Choosing a Logon Method:

This release of Peer Web Services provides three logon methods for the WWW, FTP,
and gopher services.

 - "Local" means that the user is logged on as though he or she had actually
   walked up to the computer and logged on interactively. The user must have the
   Log On Locally access right set in User Manager.

 - "Batch" means the user is logged on locally (as with the Local logon method)
   but must have the Log On As A Batch Job access right set in User Manager.
   This logon method enables the user to access the server from a Web browser
   but does not give the user the right to log on locally.

 - "Network" means the user is logged on as a remote network user. The user must
   have the Access This Computer From Network access right set in User Manager.
   This logon method enables the user to access the server from a Web browser
   but does not give the user the right to log on locally. Users logged on with
   this logon method cannot access remote, authenticated resources, such as a
   SQL server using integrated security.

Generally, you should configure the default logon method for FTP and gopher users
as Network. You should configure the default logon for WWW service users as
Network unless users need to access remote, authenticated resources.

The default logon method is Local. To change the logon method, set the registry
entry LogonMethod as described in Chapter 10, "Configuring Registry Entries," in
"Internet Information Server Installation and Administration Guide".

For the WWW service, if the user's browser supports Basic authentication, the
user is logged on using the logon method set in the LogonMethod registry entry.
If the user's browser supports Windows NT Challenge/Response authentication, the
user is always logged on using the Network logon method.

Note that Basic authentication sends user names and passwords over the network in
clear text (unencrypted text). Challenge/Response authentication is more secure
because it sends passwords in encrypted text. Currently, only Internet Explorer
2.0 or later supports Windows NT Challenge/Response authentication. For more
information on security, see Chapter 5, "Securing Your Site Against Intruders,"
in the "Peer Web Services Installation and Administration Guide".

Setting the Log File Size:

You cannot set the maximum size of the logging file by using the Web-based
version of Internet Service Manager. You must use Internet Service Manager to
set this option, which is located in the Logging Properties panel.

Internet Information Server Setup May Be Disabled After Installing ODBC 3.0:

If you installed Internet Information Server 2.0 and start the Internet
Information Server 2.0 setup program from the start menu item, it may display a
message which says that the SqlInstallODBC entry point is missing. To work
around this problem, run the IIS setup program again. The program must be run
from platform\inetsrv\inetstp.exe on the Windows NT compact disc.

To run inetstp.exe for Peer Web Services:

1. Insert the Windows NT Workstation compact disc in the drive.

2. Type d: and then press ENTER.

3. Type cd \<platform>\inetsrv and then press ENTER.

4. Type inetstp.exe and then press ENTER.

Peer Web Services Default File is Changed to Default.htm:

Upon installation of Peer Web Services, the Default Document for the WWW Service
will be set to Default.htm. If you previously had a different default document,
you need to change it in the Microsoft Internet Service Manager. Go to the start
menu and click on Programs/Peer Web Services/Internet Service Manager. This will
start the Microsoft Internet Service Manager. Double click on the WWW line in
the display. Click on the Directories tab and edit the Default Document edit
box. Click OK.

FAQ and Mailing List for IIS Developers:

Stephen Genusa's IIS FAQ answers questions about Internet Information Server and
is a good source of additional information about developing applications for
IIS. To read the FAQ, visit http://rampages.onramp.net/~steveg/iis.html.

There are many mailing lists and newsgroups that cover the broad range of
Microsoft Internet technologies and related tools. Being a member of these lists
will allow you to tap into the latest information about these tools and
technologies, and will provide you with an open forum for asking questions and
exchanging ideas with other developers. The ISAPI-L mailing list covers
information on developing Internet Information Server API applications. For
information on subscribing to the ISAPI-L mailing list and for information on
other mailing lists, visit http://www.microsoft.com/workshop/resource/mail.htm.

Windows Messaging
-----------------

Windows Messaging is installed during Windows NT Setup. You can choose Internet
Mail, Microsoft Mail, or both.

When you install Windows NT or use Windows Messaging for the first time by
double-clicking the Inbox icon on the desktop, the Windows Messaging Setup
Wizard will be run. You can then select the information services that you would
like to use with Windows Messaging. The Wizard is also run each time you add a
new profile by using the Mail option in Control Panel.

Upgrading from Windows NT 4.0 Beta 1 or Beta 2:

Note: The following information does not apply if you are running the Exchange
Client for Microsoft Exchange Server.

If you are currently running Windows NT version 4.0 Beta 1 or Beta 2 and using
the Exchange Client, use the following procedure to remove Microsoft Exchange
before upgrading to Windows NT version 4.0.

To remove Microsoft Exchange and then install Windows NT version 4.0:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

Using Windows Messaging with Microsoft Schedule+ 1.0:

Windows Messaging is designed to work with Microsoft Schedule+ version 7.0. When
Windows Messaging is installed, you can still use Schedule+ 1.0 in standalone
mode, but you will not be able to send or receive meeting requests. You will see
an error message when starting Schedule+ 1.0 that notifies you the mail spooler
cannot be started. Click Yes to continue. You are eligible for a free upgrade to
Schedule+ 7.0. In the U.S., call 1- 800-360-7561; in Canada call,
1-800-933-4750. Outside the U.S. and Canada, contact your local dealer.

Using Windows Messaging with Microsoft Schedule+ 7.0:

Schedule+ 7.0 may not run properly after you upgrade to Windows NT version 4.0.
You can work around this problem by prepending the Schedule+ 7.0 directory to
your system path. For example, if Schedule+ 7.0 is installed in c:\exchange, and
your current system path is:

   %SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%

change the path to

   c:\exchange;%SystemRoot%\system32;%SystemRoot%

To edit your path:

1. Run Control Panel and double-click System.

2. On the Environment page, click Path in System Variables.

3. Add the Schedule+ path to the front of the directories listed in Value.

4. Click Set.

Using Windows Messaging with Microsoft Mail:

Windows Messaging is designed to replace the Microsoft Mail program that comes
with Windows NT and Microsoft Mail version 3.x. After installing Windows
Messaging, you will no longer be able to run the older Microsoft mail program,
but you will be able to use Windows Messaging to send and receive messages.

Using Windows Messaging with Microsoft Mail and Remote Access Service (RAS):

Before configuring the Microsoft Mail Service for remote usage, you need to
install the Remote Access Service (RAS) and create a RAS phonebook entry by
using the Dial-Up Networking icon. If a RAS phonebook entry has not been
created, the remote configuration tabs (Remote Configuration, Remote Session,
& Dial-Up Networking) will not be available when configuring the Microsoft
Mail Service in Windows Messaging.

RAS can be installed during Windows NT Setup or from the Services tab in the
Network icon in Control Panel. The Dial-Up Networking icon is found either on
the desktop in My Computer or on the Start menu under Programs/Accesories.

Internet Mail & MIME Handling:

This version of Windows NT does not support MIME mappings to filename extensions
if Internet Explorer is not installed. Messages (containing attachments) sent in
MIME format will be sent as application/octet-stream rather than specific MIME
types. A filename will be included on outbound messages.

Printers Folder
---------------

Printers are now set up and accessed from the new Printers folder.

To view the Printers folder, click Start, point to Settings, then click
Printers.

To add a new printer, in the Printers folder, click the Add Printer wizard.

Finding Files
-------------

With Windows NT version 4.0, you have easy access to programs and files:

 - To find files on your computer, open the My Computer icon on your desktop.

 - To find a specific file, click the Start menu, point to Find, then click
   Files or Folders.

 - On the Start menu, point to Programs, then click Windows NT Explorer.

3D Pinball
----------

3D Pinball for Windows NT, a high-tech version of the classic arcade game,
provides state-of-the-art graphics and sound. For information about how to use
this game, click the Help menu in 3D Pinball. 3D Pinball is automatically

are inserted in the drive.

For this release, AutoRun is enabled by default. To disable AutoRun, set the
following key in the registry:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\CdRom\Autorun,<BR/>
REG_DWORD == 0x0

When the CD Player accessory is running, other files on the compact disc cannot
be accessed. CD Player will return the message "Device Busy".

NOTE: If you disabled AutoRun under Windows NT version 4.0 Beta 1 or Beta 2 and
upgrade to the final version of Windows NT version 4.0, it will remain
disabled.

Windows NT version 4.0 NTFS Compatibility with Windows NT version 3.51 NTFS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Windows NT File System (NTFS) file system supports clusters up to 64K.
However, the file record size is always 1K regardless of the cluster size. The
File Allocation Table (FAT) file system supports clusters up to 256K.

Due to the cluster size change, formatting a volume with 2K or larger clusters
with NTFS can generate a volume that is not usable by Windows NT version 3.51.
File record sizes that are smaller than the cluster size is not supported by
Windows NT version 3.51. However, you can ensure backwards compatibility by
running format from the command line and specifying the /a parameter. This
parameter is used to override the default disk allocation unit size.

Default settings are strongly recommended for general use.
NTFS supports 512 bytes, 1K, 2K, 4K, 8K, 16K, 32K, 64K.
FAT supports 8K, 16K, 32K, 64K, 128K, 256K.
NTFS compression is not supported for allocation unit sizes above 4K.

486 Emulator
------------

The 486 emulator allows RISC-based systems to run Windows-based and MS-DOS[ASCII
174] applications that require 386 enhanced mode support or look for a 486
processor. For example, the 486 Emulator allows you to now use Visual Basic 4.0
on RISC-based hardware platforms, such as the Digital Alpha.

Hardware Profiles
-----------------

Before you can work with a hardware profile, you must set it up and activate it.

Setting Up a Hardware Profile:

There are two ways to access the Hardware Profiles icon. You can use either My
Computer or the Control Panel.

Using My Computer:
Using the right mouse button, click My Computer, then select Properties.

Using Control Panel:

1. On the Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the System icon.

3. Click the Hardware Profiles tab.

4. The Available Hardware Profiles box displays existing hardware profiles.

One hardware profile is listed. This profile was created automatically when you
installed Windows NT.

To create a new profile, click Copy and type a new hardware profile name.

The order of your hardware profiles in the listbox is important because it
determines a default order at startup. You can use the up and down arrow buttons
to place the hardware profile that you would like as a default at the top of the
list.

Activating a Hardware Profile:

Select a configuration from a list that appears at startup. Startup will not
continue until you have selected a hardware profile.

You can have your computer activate one hardware profile by default when you
start your computer. From the Hardware Profiles box, enter 0 as the timeout
value. If you decide later to select a different hardware profile, press the
spacebar at startup and choose a hardware profile from your list.

You can specify an amount of time that you would like your computer to wait
before defaulting to the first selection on your highest-order preference.
During the waiting period, you can use the cursor keys to select an alternate
profile.

Hardware Profiles and Boot Devices:

When using hardware profiles, be careful not to disable one of your boot devices.
If you disable a required boot device, Windows NT might not start. Microsoft
recommends that you make a copy of your default profile and then make changes to
the new profile so you can restore the default profile if something unexpected
occurs.

NDS-Aware Client/Gateway Services for NetWare
---------------------------------------------

The Windows NT version 4.0 includes an NDS-aware version of the Microsoft Windows
NT Client/Gateway Services for NetWare (CSNW/GSNW).

This version enables users running the Windows NT platform to access Novell[ASCII
174] NetWare[ASCII 174] 4.x servers running NetWare Directory Services (NDS).
With NDS, shared objects on participating NetWare servers are organized into a
hierarchical tree.

This updated version of Client/Gateway Services for NetWare includes all the
functionality of previous versions, in addition to NDS compatibility.

Creating Print Gateways to Print Queues on NDS Servers:

When you create a print gateway to a print queue on an NDS-authenticated server,
you must also create a file gateway from the gateway server to a file share on
the same NDS-authenticated server for the print gateway to work.

Using the Dir Command on NDS Trees:

To use the dir command to see the directory contents of a remote NDS directory,
put the directory path in quote marks. For example, the following command works
successfully:

dir "\\nds-tree\cn=volume.ou=unit.o=group"

Creating a Gateway to an NDS Volume:

To create a gateway to an NDS volume, type the complete NDS volume name (such as
cn=volume.ou=unit.o=group) in Network Path in the New Share dialog box after
clicking the Gateway button. For this to work, the NTGATEWAY group must exist in
the organizational unit (ou) where the volume is created, and the gateway
account must be a member of the NTGATEWAY group on that ou.

Client Licenses
---------------

Occasionally, client licenses are held after a user logs off. The problem can
appear on the client workstation from one of the following areas that may cause
this problem on the client workstation:

 - Print event logging. The license can be held between print messages that are
   logged in Event Viewer. To resolve this problem, disable logging on the
   client workstation.

To disable print event logging:

   1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

   2. On the File menu, click Server Properties.

   3. Click the Advanced tab and then clear the Log spooler error events, Log
      spooler warning events, and Log spooler information events check boxes.

   4. Shutdown and restart your computer.

 - RAS Service. The license may be held by the RAS service when no one is logged
   in. As soon as someone (either the same or different user) logs into the
   client workstation, the license will be released.

Dynamic Display Properties
--------------------------

Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server version 4.0 allow you to change your
display properties without rebooting your computer. To change display
properties, right click on the desktop and choose Properties.

Some applications may freeze or close abruptly if you change display properties
while the program is running, resulting in the loss of unsaved data. You should
close terminal emulators, remote control hosts and clients, and other similar
applications before changing anything on the Appearance, Plus!, or Settings tabs
of the Display Properties dialog box.
