MORE INFORMATION
================

The SHAPES32 sample illustrates deriving an OLE control from a base control,
thus allowing the derived control to take advantage of the base control's
methods, properties, and events.

The SHAPES32 sample implements a base control class called CBaseShapeCtrl, and
two derived control classes called CCircleCtrl and CRectangleCtrl. CCircleCtrl
and CRectangleCtrl draw themselves using the properties provided by the base
CBaseShapeCtrl class. CCircleCtrl and CRectangleCtrl also allow access to the
methods and events implemented in the base CBaseShapeCtrl class.

Properties, Methods, and Events
-------------------------------

The CBaseShapeCtrl class provides the base functionality of a simple shape
control. It implements the following properties, events, and methods:

Name          Type       Use
------------  ---------  ---------------------------------------------------
FillColor     Property   An OLE_COLOR value which represents the color
used
                         to fill the shape.

LineColor     Property   An OLE_COLOR value which represents the color
used
                         for the shape's outline.

LineWidth     Property   A short value which represents the line width in
                         pixels of the shape's outline.

BaseMethod1   Method     A test method which, when invoked, fires the
                         BaseEvent1 event. Takes a single parameter of type
                         long.

BaseMethod2   Method     A test method which, when invoked, fires the
                         BaseEvent2 event. Takes a single parameter of type
                         BSTR.

BaseEvent1    Event      A test event. Returns a long.

BaseEvent2    Event      A test event. Returns a BSTR.

The CCircleCtrl class provides the functionality of a simple circle control.

It implements the following properties, events, and methods:

Name           Type       Use
-------------  ---------  ---------------------------------------------------
CircleShape    Property   A boolean value. If TRUE the control draws
itself
                          as a circle, if FALSE it draws itself as an
                          ellipse.

CircleOffset   Property   A short value which represents the number of
                          pixels offset from the center of the bounding
                          rectangle at which the control will draw itself.

CircleMethod1  Method     A test method which, when invoked, fires the
                          CircleEvent1 event. Takes a single parameter of
                          type long.

CircleMethod2  Method     A test method which, when invoked, fires the
                          CircleEvent2 event. Takes a single parameter of
                          type long.

CircleEvent1   Event      A test event. Returns a long.

CircleEvent2   Event      A test event. Returns a long.

The CRectangleCtrl class provides the functionality of a simple rectangle
control. It implements the following properties, events, and methods:

Name            Type       Use
--------------  ---------  ---------------------------------------------------
RoundedCorners  Property   A boolean value. If TRUE the control draws
                           itself with rounded corners, if FALSE it draws
                           itself with square corners.

RectangleInset  Property   A short value which represents the number of
                           pixels inside the control's bounding rectangle
                           by which the control will inset itself.

RectMethod1     Method     A test method which, when invoked, fires the
                           RectEvent1 event. Takes no parameters.

RectMethod2     Method     A test method which, when invoked, fires the
                           RectEvent2 event. Takes no parameters.

RectEvent1      Event      A test event. Returns void.

RectEvent2      Event      A test event. Returns void.

Modifying the Base Control Class
--------------------------------

Several changes need be made to the code generated by ControlWizard to allow a
derived control to cleanly inherit the functionality provided by a base control.
The following changes were made to the files generated by ClassWizard:

1. The ON_OLEVERB entry for AFX_IDS_VERB_PROPERTIES in the CBaseShapeCtrl
   message map was removed:

         BEGIN_MESSAGE_MAP(CBaseShapeCtrl, COleControl)
           //{{AFX_MSG_MAP(CBaseShapeCtrl)
           //}}AFX_MSG_MAP
           //ON_OLEVERB(AFX_IDS_VERB_PROPERTIES, OnProperties)
         END_MESSAGE_MAP()

   If this isn't done, control containers will list the Properties... verb twice
   when the Edit | Control Object menu is selected.

2. The CBaseShapeCtrl::CBaseShapeCtrlFactory::UpdateRegistry function was
   changed to simply return TRUE:

         BOOL CBaseShapeCtrl::CBaseShapeCtrlFactory::UpdateRegistry(BOOL
           bRegister)
         {
           return TRUE;
         }

   If this isn't done the base control will get registered and containers will
   list it along with the derived controls when the user attempts to insert a
   new control.

3. The CBaseShapePropPage::CBaseShapePropPageFactory::UpdateRegistry function
   was changed to simply return TRUE:

         BOOL CBaseShapePropPage::CBaseShapePropPageFactory::UpdateRegistry(
            BOOL bRegister)
          {
            return TRUE;
          }

   If this isn't done the base class control's property page will get registered
   and will appear in the registry.

4. The call to InitializeIIDs in the base control class' constructor was
   removed:

         CBaseShapeCtrl::CBaseShapeCtrl()
         {
           //InitializeIIDs(&IID_DBaseShape, &IID_DBaseShapeEvents);

           // TODO: Initialize your control's instance data here.
         }

   If this isn't done there will be a memory leak upon termination when the
   cached type information for the base class does not get freed.

5. The base control's section of the project's .ODL file was commented out.

   If this isn't done, some containers, for example, Visual Basic 4.0, will fail
   to load the control.

6. The CBaseShapeCtrl::DoPropExchange method was modified to not call the
   COleControl::ExchangeVersion function:

         void CBaseShapeCtrl::DoPropExchange(CPropExchange* pPX)
         {
           // ExchangeVersion(pPX, MAKELONG(_wVerMinor, _wVerMajor));
           COleControl::DoPropExchange(pPX);

           ...
         }

   The _Version property is serialized via a call to the ExchangeVersion method
   in the DoPropExchange method of the derived control.

7. The DoPropExchange method of the derived OLE controls were changed to make a
   call to CBaseShapeCtrl::DoPropExchange instead of
   COleControl::DoPropExchange:

         void CCircleCtrl::DoPropExchange(CPropExchange* pPX)
         {
           ExchangeVersion(pPX, MAKELONG(_wVerMinor, _wVerMajor));
           CBaseShapeCtrl::DoPropExchange(pPX);

           ...
         }

Manually Updating the Project's ODL File
----------------------------------------

ClassWizard does not provide any support for developing OLE controls which are
derived from another control. As a result, the property, method, and event
dispatch ID's used by a derived control class need to be manually updated. MFC
Technical Note #39 discusses the dispatch ID numbering scheme used by MFC.

Basically, MFC divides a 32-bit dispatch ID (DISPID) into two parts. The LOWORD
of the DISPID contains the distance from the top of the dispatch map (1
relative). The HIWORD contains the distance of the dispatch map from the most
derived class (0 relative).

The CCircleCtrl and CRectangleControl classes use this technique with their
DISPIDs. For example, the CCircleCtrl derived control inherits the
FillColor,LineColor, and LineWidth properties from CBaseShapeCtrl. The DISPID's
for these properties need to be manually added to the CCircleCtrl properties
section of the project's .ODL file and the HIWORD of the DISPID's needs to be
adjusted:

      //  Primary dispatch interface for CCircleCtrl
      [ uuid(A7EC6760-BFED-11CE-8250-524153480001),
        helpstring("Dispatch interface for sample Circle Control"), hidden ]
      dispinterface _DCircle
      {
        properties:
          // NOTE - ClassWizard will maintain property information here.
          //    Use extreme caution when editing this section.
          //{{AFX_ODL_PROP(CCircleCtrl)
          [id(65537)] OLE_COLOR FillColor;
          [id(65538)] OLE_COLOR LineColor;
          [id(65539)] short LineWidth;
          [id(1)] boolean CircleShape;
          [id(2)] short CircleOffset;
          //}}AFX_ODL_PROP
          ...

The FillColor, LineColor, and LineWidth properties implemented in the base class
have DISPID's of 1, 2, and 3 respectively. Once the HIWORD portion of these
DISPID's has been adjusted they become 65537, 65538, and 65539.

The DISPID's for events are handled differently than for properties and methods.
Event DISPID's do not have their HIWORD portion adjusted. Instead, they are
sequential. For example, CCircleCtrl inherits the BaseEvent1 and BaseEvent2
events from the base control. The DISPID's for the base events need to be
manually added to the CCircleCtrl events section of the project's .ODL file.
Also, the DISPID's assigned by ClassWizard for the events provided by
CCircleCtrl (CircleEvent1 and CircleEvent2) need to have their DISPIDs manually
updated:

      [ uuid(A7EC6761-BFED-11CE-8250-524153480001),
        helpstring("Event interface for sample Circle Control") ]
      dispinterface _DCircleEvents
      {
        properties:
          //  Event interface has no properties

        methods:
          // NOTE - ClassWizard will maintain event information here.
          //    Use extreme caution when editing this section.
          //{{AFX_ODL_EVENT(CCircleCtrl)
          [id(1)] void BaseEvent1(long lParam);
          [id(2)] void BaseEvent2(BSTR pszString);
          [id(3)] void CircleEvent1(long lParam);
          [id(4)] void CircleEvent2(long lParam);
          //}}AFX_ODL_EVENT
      };

Manually updating the DISPIDs can be problematic because ClassWizard may get
confused when it sees the entries for the events in the base class. It's
possible that more than one event may be assigned the same DISPID. After adding
new events to a derived class, inspect the project's .ODL file and fix any
conflicts.

ClassWizard also maintains DISPID values for properties, methods, and events, in
an enum member of the COleControl derived class. Again, because ClassWizard does
not support deriving an OLE control from another control, it may generate
conflicting values for the different DISPIDs. If this happens, manually edit the
values so that they are correct and match the values as specified in the .ODL
file. Following is the portion of the CCircleCtrl class that shows the DISPIDs
used for both the base class and derived class properties, events, and methods:

      class CCircleCtrl : public CBaseShapeCtrl
      {
      ...

      // Dispatch and event IDs
      public:
        enum {
        //{{AFX_DISP_ID(CCircleCtrl)
        //dispidFillColor   = 65537L,
        //dispidLineColor   = 65538L,
        //dispidLineWidth   = 65539L,
        //dispidBaseMethod1 = 65540L,
        //dispidBaseMethod2 = 65541L,

        dispidCircleShape   = 1L,
        dispidCircleOffset  = 2L,
        dispidCircleMethod1 = 3L,
        dispidCircleMethod2 = 4L,

        //eventidBaseEvent1 = 1L,
        //eventidBaseEvent2 = 2L,
        eventidCircleEvent1 = 3L,
        eventidCircleEvent2 = 4L,
        //}}AFX_DISP_ID
      };
