usually in your system directory. This directory should also be on your search
path (specified by the PATH command). If you cannot find the Help file on your
computer, contact your network administrator. Your administrator should copy the
Help file from the Windows NT distribution disks to your computer.

Error 3711
----------

   The Help file is empty.

Explanation: Help file, Net.hlp, is damaged. The file is usually in your system
directory.

Error 3712
----------

   The Help file is corrupted.

Explanation: Help file, Net.hlp, is damaged. The file is usually in your system

administrator if the domain controller is running.
