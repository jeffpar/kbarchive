SUMMARY
=======

The following information was taken from the Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11 NETWORKS.WRI file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

3.0  Using Banyan VINES

Windows for Workgroups 3.11 works with Banyan VINES network versions
4.11(5), 5.00(5), and 5.52(5). It can work with both the Microsoft
Windows Network and the Banyan VINES network. Before you install your
specific version of VINES, see "Special Information about Specific
Versions of VINES," later in this document.

Before you set up Windows for Workgroups 3.11 to work with VINES, set
up VINES on your computer according to the directions in your VINES
documentation. Then run PCCONFIG to choose the appropriate drivers
for your network, and make sure you can connect to a VINES server
from MS-DOS. For more information on installing VINES support in
Windows for Workgroups, see Chapter 9, "Using Other Networks," in the
Microsoft Workgroup Add-On "User's Guide."

3.1 Changes to System Files when You Install Support for Banyan VINES

When you install Banyan VINES support in Windows for Workgroups, the
following lines are added to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

C:\<Windows directory>\NET INITIALIZE
CD <VINES directory>
BAN /NC
NDISBAN
REDIRALL
C:\<Windows directory>\NET START
ARSWAIT
Z:LOGIN

The following line is added to your CONFIG.SYS file:

LASTDRIVE=Y

The following lines are added to the PROTOCOL.INI file:

[network.setup]
   transport=ban$vines,BAN$VINES
   lana0=<network adapter>,1,ban$vines
[Ban$Vines]
   drivername=NDISBAN$
   bindings=<network adapter>

The following lines are added to the SYSTEM.INI file:

[boot]
   secondnet.drv=vines.drv       <- z:vines.drv for VINES 4.11
                              and VINES 5.00;
vines.drv for
VINES 5.52

[386Enh]
   secondnet=vvinesd.386      <- z:vvines.386 for VINES 4.11
                              and VINES 5.00;
vvines.386 for
VINES 5.52

[network]
   multinet=vines500          <- vines411 or vines550 for
                              different VINES versions

3.2 Special Information about Specific Versions of VINES

Vines 4.10
If your network runs VINES 4.10, you must upgrade to VINES 4.11 (5)
before you install support for Windows for Workgroups.

Vines 4.11
If your network runs VINES 4.11 (5), your network administrator must
apply the (5)-FW-1 and (5)-GN-1 software patches before you install
support for Windows for Workgroups.

Vines 5.00
If your network runs VINES 5.00 (5), your network administrator must
apply the (5)-EA-1 and (5)-ER-1 software patches before you install
support for Windows for Workgroups.

If your network runs VINES 5.00 (6), install VINES support for 5.00
(5) according to the installation instructions.  When you are
prompted to restart your workstation at the end of the installation
procedure, do so.

After you restart your workstation:

1. Back up the PROTMAN.DOS and NDISBAN.COM files to another directory
   before you run NEWREV.

2. From the MS-DOS prompt, run the NEWREV command to upgrade to VINES
   5.00 (6).

Note: Make sure you back up the PROTMAN.DOS and NDISBAN.COM files,
because as the NEWREV program overwrites the PROTMAN.DOS and
NDISBAN.COM files located in the Windows for Workgroups directory.

3. Copy the PROTMAN.DOS and NDISBAN.COM files back to the Windows for
   Workgroups directory.

4. Restart your workstation.

This procedure ensures that you are using the correct versions of
these two files.

VINES 5.52 (5) Networks
If your network runs VINES 5.52 (5), you must copy NDISBAN.COM to
your local VINES directory that contains your VINES network software.
 Use the PCCOPY command to copy this file from your VINES 5.52 (5)
server to your workstation.

3.3 Banyan VINES Troubleshooting Tips

This section provides solutions to some common problems you might
encounter when you run Windows for Workgroups on a Banyan VINES
network.

Cannot run VINES commands from AUTOEXEC.BAT
You may already have a line that says CD \<Banyan directory>, but it
may not be in the correct place in the file. Open the AUTOEXEC.BAT
file using a text editor and move the command to the line above the
BAN /NC command.

Environment Variables Overwritten
When you install VINES support for Windows for Workgroups, the VINES LOGIN
command is placed near the beginning of your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. PATH (and
other environment variables) in your VINES user profile are overwritten by
the environment variables in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

To work around this problem, carry out one of the following steps:

 - Place all the environment variables, including PATH, only in your
   user profile

   -or-

 - Place all environment variables after the LOGIN command in your
   AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

If you want to add the user profile PATH environment variable to the
PATH environment variable in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, type %path%
after the LOGIN command at the end of your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

For example, the following statement appends the user profile PATH
values (%path%) to the existing PATH values (C:\C:\WINWG) in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

   PATH=c:\;c:\winwg;%path%

Cannot Access the VINES Network
If you cannot access the VINES network, make sure the SYSTEM.INI file
includes these lines:

    network.drv=wfwnet.drv
    secondnet.drv=VINES.DRV   <-  z:vines.drv for VINES
                                   4.11 and
VINES 5.00; vines.drv
     for VINES 5.52

In a Windows for Workgroups environment, the NETWORK.DRV statement
specifies the Windows for Workgroups network driver (WFWNET.DRV). The
SECONDNET.DRV statement specifies the VINES network driver
(VINES.DRV).

4.0 Using Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with DEC PATHWORKS

If you want to use the DEC PATHWORKS network with Windows for Workgroups,
you can use it instead of the Microsoft Windows Network. You cannot use the
two networks together unless you manually edit your files.

Before you begin, install the DEC PATHWORKS network software on your
computer according to the directions in your PATHWORKS documentation.
Then make sure you can connect to a PATHWORKS server from MS-DOS. For
more information on installing PATHWORKS support in Windows for
Workgroups, see Chapter 9, "Using Other Networks," in the Microsoft
Workgroup Add-On "User's Guide."

Once you have installed PATHWORKS support, Windows for Workgroups can
be used to connect to PATHWORKS servers, but you will not be able to
use Windows for Workgroups to share resources on your local machine.

4.1 Changes to System Files When You Install Support for DEC
    PATHWORKS Instead of the Microsoft Windows Network

When you install DEC PATHWORKS support in Windows for Workgroups, the
following lines are added to your SYSTEM.INI file.

[boot]
network.drv=pcsa.drv

[boot.description]
network.drv=DEC PATHWORKS

[386Enh]
network=*dosnet, decnet.386, decnb.386
TimerCriticalSection=10000

4.2  DEC PATHWORKS Support to Work With the Microsoft Windows Network

Windows Setup does not set up DEC PATHWORKS to work along with the
Microsoft Windows Network. If you want to use both networks together,
you must edit your SYSTEM.INI, PROTOCOL.INI, STARTNET.BAT, and
AUTOEXEC.BAT files by hand.

For information on setting up both networks to work together, see the
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Resource Kit.

5.0 Using Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with Artisoft LANtastic

You can use Windows for Workgroups with Artisoft LANtastic instead of
the Microsoft Windows Network. However, you cannot use the two
networks together.

5.1 Changes to System Files When You Install Artisoft LANtastic Drivers

Before you install LANtastic 5.0 for Windows, install the LANtastic
MS-DOS-level drivers. Make sure that all connections between the
machines are correctly set up.

The MS-DOS-level drivers will install into the following directory:

   c:\lantasti

The installation will make the following changes to your CONFIG.SYS file:

   files=75
   buffers=32
   lastdrive=z
   fcbs=32,8

No changes will be made to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

The LANtastic network will be started by a file called STARTNET.BAT,
which looks similar to the following:

   @echo off
   Set LAN_DIR=C:\LANTASTI.NET
   SET LAN_CFG=C:\LANTASTI
   PATH C:\LANTASTI;%PATH%
   SHARE /L:200

   3C503MM IRQ=3 IOBASE=300 TRANSCEIVER_TYPE=ON-BORAD VERBOSE
   AILANBIO
   REDIR MACHINENAME LOGINS=3
   SERVER

   NET LOGIN/WAIT
   NET LPT TIMEOUT 10
   NET POSTBOX

5.2 Changes to System Files When You Install Support for Artisoft LANtastic

After you have installed the correct net card driver and can
communicate with other LANtastic machines, you can install LANtastic
for Windows.

To install LANtastic for Windows, go to Networks Setup and choose to
install support for LANtastic 5x. Setup will prompt you for the
following drivers:

   LANTASTI.386
   LANTNET.DRV

These drivers are provided by LANtastic and will either be in the
LANTASTI subdirectory or on the vendor-provided disks.

The PROTOCOL.INI file will include the following changes:

   [network.setup]
   version=0x3110

The SYSTEM.INI file will include the following changes:

   [boot]
   network.drv=lantnet.drv

   [boot description]
   network.drv=Artisoft LANtastic (version 5.X)

   [386Enh]
   network=*vnetbios,lantasti.386
   netmisc=
   netcard=
   transport=

   [network]
  =LANtastic/xx050000

   [LANtastic]
   Network_IRQ=XX

After you have finished installing support for LANtastic 5x, run the
LANtastic 5x installation program. The program will install in a
directory named C:\LANI. The installation program will also create a
LANtastic group in Program Manager and add the following line to the
WIN.INI file:

load=C:\LANI\WNET.EXE

5.3 More Information about Using Artisoft LANtastic with Windows for
Workgroups 3.11

Do not use the net use command to redirect the name of the drive
where Windows for Workgroups is installed. If you do, Windows for
Workgroups will not be able to run.

6.0 Using Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with SunSelect  PC-NFS

Windows for Workgroups 3.11 works with SunSelect PC-NFS version 5.00.

If you are installing PC-NFS for use with Windows for Workgroups for the
first time, you should run both the installation and configuration programs
according to the directions in your PC-NFS documentation. Then install
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 without support for a secondary network
operating system.

Once Windows for Workgroups is installed, you will need to run the
WINSTALL.EXE program from the PC-NFS disk number 3. Insert disk number 3
into a diskette drive and then from inside Windows for Workgroups select
the File menu choose Run, and type A:WINSTALL.EXE (substitute B: if that is
the drive being used). This will install the PC-NFS utilities for Windows
as well as several Windows support files which are required for proper
functionality.

Once you have finished this procedure you can set up Windows for Workgroups
3.11 to work with both the Microsoft Windows Network and PC-NFS. In the
Network group, choose Network Setup. Choose the Networks button and then
select "SunSelect PC-NFS (version 5.0)" from the list of Other additional
Networks. Click on OK. Changes will be made to the PROTOCOL.INI and
SYSTEM.INI files. Changes will also be required to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
These changes should have been performed during the installation and
configuration of the PC-NFS software. Restart the computer for these
changes to take effect.

If you are upgrading Windows for Workgroups 3.11 over an existing Windows
for Workgroups 3.1 you can select PC-NFS as the secondary network during
the initial setup procedure.

For more information on installing PC-NFS support in Windows for
Workgroups, see Chapter 9, "Using Other Networks," in the Microsoft
Workgroup Add-On User's Guide.

6.1 Changes to System Files When You Install Support for PC-NFS

Once Windows for Workgroups is installed, you will need to run the
WINSTALL.EXE program from the PC-NFS disks to install the PC-NFS utilities
for Windows.

The PC-NFS installation process makes the following changes to your
AUTOEXEC.BAT, PROTOCOL.INI, and SYSTEM.INI files:

It adds the following lines to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

   Set TZ=EST5EDT
   Set NFSDRIVE=C
   Set NFSPATH=C:\NFS
   NET INIT
   Set TN_DIR=C:\NFS\TELNET
   C:\NFS\PRT *
   C:\NFS\NET INIT
   C:\NFS\RTM

Note: The SET statements vary with each installation.

It adds the following line to your CONFIG.SYS file:

   Device=C:\WINDOWS\IFSHLP.SYS

It removes the following line from your CONFIG.SYS file:

   Device=C:\NFS\SOCKDRV.SYS

PROTOCOL.INI File

   [network.setup]
