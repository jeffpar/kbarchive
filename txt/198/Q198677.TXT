The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article contains suggestions to help you troubleshoot the most common
problems that can occur with the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Initial Installation and Configuration
--------------------------------------

 - Make sure that the customer has installed the Exchange Notes Connector and
   configured it. The initial installation of the Exchange Notes Connector only
   copies the files to the correct locations on the hard disk. You need to
   configure the Exchange Notes Connector after you install it. Depending on the
   version of the Exchange Notes Connector (version 3.2 or 5.5), you either run
   the Setup program from the Linkage folder or the Notes Configuration utility
   from the Exchange Connectivity folder.

 - Make sure that if you are running the Exchange Notes Connector version 3.2,
   that you have the latest patch installed. The latest patch can be found at
   the following location:

   ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/exchange/exchange-public/fixes/Eng/Linkage/Patch827/

   You can download the Lspatch.exe file, which is simply a compressed executable
   file. Copy and run the lspatch -o -d command in the Linkage folder.

 - There is a known problem that can occur if you run more than seven Exchange
   Server-related services. The following error message is displayed:

   Initialization of the dynamic link library D:\WINNT\system32\USER32.dll has
   failed. The process is terminating abnormally.

For additional information about the workaround for this problem, click the
article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q158308 XFOR: Err Msg: Initialization of Dynamic Link Library Failed

 - The default location for the Notes.ini file is in the Winnt folder. This file
   is most likely used by the Exchange Notes Connector, barring any changes to
   the system path or manual modifications of the Notes Client INI file
   location. You can check this in the Linkage.ini or Exchconn.ini files, or in
   the properties for the Exchange Notes Connector.

 - Ensure that the Notes folder is in the Windows NT System path, or the
   Exchange Notes Connector will not work. However, if the Exchange Notes
   Connector seems to start even though the Notes folder is not specified, there
   may be multiple copies of the Nnotes.dll file on your disk. Remove all copies
   of this file, except the copy that is in your Notes folder. You must restart
   the computer for this change to take effect.

 - Ensure that the Notes Client can make a successful connection to the target
   Notes server. Open up the Mail.box (Notes Mail Router) file on the Notes
   server. Check to make sure that you do not open databases on Local.

 - Make sure that the Notes Client 4.52 or later is installed properly with the
   correct Notes ID assigned to that client. To check this; start the Notes
   Client, and check in the menu "File" [ASCII 150] "Tools" [ASCII 150] "User
   Id". When you start the Notes Client and open any Notes database, you should
   not be presented with the option to specify a password. Note that although
   other 4.x version Notes Clients might work, they are not supported.

 - The permissions on the Mail.box file should theoretically be set to
   Depositor. However, there may be cases where you need to set the permissions
   to Manager level, with Delete permissions. The most common way to set the
   permissions on the Mail.box file is to start the Notes Client on the Notes
   server with the Notes Server ID or as the administrator, and open the
   Mail.box file locally. The Remote.exe utility can also simulate a Notes open
   session that can determine if those databases are accessible from the
   Exchange Notes Connector server.

 - If the Notes Client is unable to make a connection to the Notes server, check
   the following:

    - Make sure that other Notes users are able to connect.

    - Check the Location document, which is located on the bottom right corner
      in the Notes Client. It should say "Office," as opposed to "Home." There
      are also other names possible, edit the Location document to confirm the
      names.

    - If the Notes server name is different than its Microsoft Windows NT server
      name, the problem is very likely a name resolution problem. Check all the
      usual host and network basic input/output system (NetBIOS) name resolution
      mechanisms.

    - Check the Person document for the Exchange Notes Connector ID as well.
      Make sure that the mail or home server actually points to the correct
      Notes server. In some cases, during the creation of the Exchange Notes
      Connector ID, the mail or home server may be incorrect.

 - After you start the Exchange Notes Connector, start the LinkAge Administrator
   (version 3.2) or Connectivity Administrator (version 5.5). Check the
   processes to make sure that they are all idle. Check the log browser for
   information and possible error messages that may be logged by the Exchange
   Notes Connector.

 - Another common problem occurs because of the name of the Notes server that is
   specified in the Exchange Notes Connector configuration. In Notes, all
   configuration assumes a fully qualified Notes address, for example,
   <Notes_server>/<Notes_domain>. A common symptom of this problem
   is the logging of the following entries in the Browse log:

   1998/03/02 05:23:28-LME-NOTES-NTSMEX(0157) 1 41217:Error opening Notes Mail
   Box: notessna/Dns!!exchange.box

   To try to resolve this problem, simply specify the Notes server name without
   the Notes domain in the Exchange Notes Connector property [ASCII 150]
   options. However, use this method with caution. This method is not guaranteed
   to resolve the problem; there may be other issues occurring concurrently, and
   this method may cause the resolution of Notes doclinks to Uniform Resource
   Locator (URL) links to stop working.

 - When the Exchange Notes Connector starts, two mail files are created, the
   Exchange.box and Exchange.bad files (if the Notes server and the Exchange
   Notes Connector use the default configuration). If the files were created
   manually, check to make sure that the Exchange Notes Connector ID has Manager
   level access. Microsoft strongly recommends that you let the Exchange Notes
   Connector create these files during startup; this eliminates any possible
   permission or access control list (ACL) errors.

 - When a message is sent from Notes to the Exchange Server domain, you may
   receive an error message that states that a route could not be found for a
   domain. Check the Foreign Domain document and ensure that the Notes server
   has been recycled as well.

 - There is a small possibility that the Notes domain may actually be the same
   as the Exchange Server foreign domain. This can only occur with a first time
   Notes server installation in which the Notes domain is given as "Exchange."
   Obviously this would conflict with the "Exchange" Foreign Domain. This
   results in very strange behavior between Exchange Server and Notes,
   especially with directory synchronization (dirsync).

 - If you have checked all of the items above and the Exchange Notes Connector
   processes are not all "Idle," reset the Notes.ini file. The Notes.ini file is
   generally located in the Winnt folder. To reset the Notes.ini file, locate
   the following lines in the file, and delete all the lines in the Notes.ini
   file except these lines (note that you can also reset the Notes server by
   changing the KitType to 2):

   [Notes]

   KitType=1 Directory=d:\notes\data WinNTIconPath=d:\notes\data\W32

   Then start the Notes Client again; it prompts you to supply the usual initial
   Notes Client configuration information.

 - Make sure that if there are other Exchange Server sites that are connected by
   using an Exchange connector (an X.400 Connector, a Site Connector, and so
   on), those sites have the Notes Proxy Address Generator installed. In
   general, you need to do this for all of the users in downstream sites who
   want to communicate to Notes users. There are currently two ways to do this:

    - Run the Exchange Connectivity (version 5.5) or Linkage (version 3.2) Setup
      program that is installed on the Exchange Server with the Exchange Notes
      Connector, and select the option to install a downstream Notes proxy
      address. You are prompted for a server in that particular site.

      -or-

    - Manually run the executables in either the Exchconn\Install or
      Linkage\Install folders.

   Some users, generally custom recipients, may be missing the Notes proxy
   address in their list of e-mail addresses. You can force the Notes proxy
   address for all of the users in the site by issuing the following command
   from either the C:\Linkage\Install or C:\Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn\Install
   folder, as applicable:

   MEXUPADD /Server= MEXServerName /Org= MEXOrganization /Site= MEXSite
   /Machine=<i386 or alpha> /Addrtype=NOTES /UPDATE /SF

   NOTE: The above command is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

Mail Flow Problems
------------------

 - The two most important files in Notes are the Exchange.box and Mail.box
   files. Most mail flow problems are related to these two files. The most
   common problems are permissions or ACL settings problems. Select the Notes
   database, then from the Notes menu, select, "File" [ASCII 150] "Database"
   [ASCII 150] "Access Control." Make sure that the Exchange Notes Connector ID
   has been granted Manager access with Delete Documents selected.

 - There is also a small possibility that either or both of the Exchange.box and
   Mail.box files are corrupted. To correct these mail files, run "Database
   Tools" from "File" [ASCII 150] "Tools" [ASCII 150] "Server Administration."
   You can select the database and "Tool." Select "DB Fixup." Consult the Notes
   administrator for further details before you start this tool. You can start
   the DB Fixup tool by issuing a command on the Notes server console as well,
   for example:

   LOAD FIXUP EXCHANGE.BOX

 - The easiest way to test mail flow is to send e-mail to an Exchange Server
   user from another Notes client, and have the Exchange Server user reply to
   the e-mail. Check the Notes proxy address in the Site Addressing properties
   in Exchange Server to determine the default naming convention that is used
   for Exchange Server mailboxes. The default naming convention is the
   following:

   &d/"<Exchange_Server_site>"/"<Exchange_Server_
   organization>"@"<foreign_domain_for_Exchange_Server_in_Notes>"

   NOTE: The above naming convention is one path; it has been wrapped for
   readability.

   This may be changed to simply &d@"<foreign_domain_for
   Exchange_Server_in_Notes>", for example, &d@exchange.

 - The Exchange Notes Connector can send Notes doclinks from Notes to Exchange
   Server as OLE objects, as well as in a Rich Text Format RTF attachment.
   However, for this to work the Notes Client must also be installed and work
   properly on the workstation of the target Exchange Server user. The Exchange
   Notes Connector simply passes OLE links along to the recipient, because there
   is no mechanism for the Exchange Notes Connector to verify whether the
   recipient has the capability to access the OLE link.

 - However, the Exchange Notes Connector checks RTF links for validity on each
   message that is processed. If the Exchange Notes Connector is not able to
   access this RTF link, it sends an error message in the message. This can
   occur if you send a "Database or View Link" that is not a doclink from Notes
   to Exchange Server with the RTF setting selected. The Exchange Notes
   Connector does not convert "Database or View Link" objects to any type of RTF
   attachment.

 - There is a third option in the Exchange Server 5.5 Exchange Notes Connector
   that converts the Notes doclink to a URL shortcut (this option is only
   applicable for a Notes Domino server). If the Notes server name (the Domain
   Name System (DNS) entry defined in the Notes server document) cannot be
   properly resolved, then an RTF link is issued. The rules for problems with
   RTF links apply as usual.

   The following error message may be logged when you attempt to send a Notes
   doclink from Notes to Exchange Server with the Exchange Notes Connector
   configured to convert Notes doclinks to URLs:

   1998/08/25 14:30:08- LME-NOTES-NTSMEX(0202) 3 41419:Cannot locate HTTP Server
   name for CN=snanotes/O=XFOR in HTTP Server section of Notes Address Book,
   searching Notes Server Network Configuration for enabled TCPIP port

   Note that by default, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) task for the
   Notes Domino server is not properly configured to allow the Exchange Notes
   Connector to resolve and convert doclinks to URLs. Open the server document
   in Notes. Under Network Configuration, there should be an entry for port
   Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) enabled, if not, add
   or enable the port with the correct Net address. Next check the HTTP Server
   section; under the Basics section, "Bind to host name" is disabled by
   default. Change "Bind to host name" to enabled. Save the server document. You
   do not need to restart the task. Also check the Exchange Notes Connector
   properties to make sure that the Notes server name is the fully qualified
   name.


 - You may experience problems when you send OLE links across the Exchange Notes
   Connector. In general, these problems occur when a Notes user sends a Notes
   doclink to an Exchange Server user, and when the Exchange Server user opens
   the doclink, either the window does not open properly or the window is not
   displayed properly.

   The Exchange Notes Connector does not do anything to doclinks that are sent
   from Notes, except put a "wrapper" (moniker) around the DOC or OLE object.
   The Exchange Notes Connector then passes the doclink to Exchange Server. To
   find out whether problems originate in the Exchange Notes Connector, copy
   this doclink to the clipboard, and then paste it to your desktop. This forces
   Notes to generate the first layer of the wrapper, which is what the Exchange
   Notes Connector passes. Close the Notes Client, and then double-click the
   link shortcut, which starts Notes and opens the Notes database. If this link
   shortcut works, but the message link does not work when you send it to
   Exchange Server, the Exchange Notes Connector may be processing the link
   incorrectly. However, that is unlikely.

 - In some cases, the From header may appear strange, for example:

   From: Ward, Bryan On Behalf Of Bryan Ward/DISA/REGIONB@REGION_B

   This is the result of a problem in the Notes Client configuration of the
   mailbox. The Notes Client should not send a message on behalf of itself. Open
   the Notes Client, and open the mail database. Click Calendar to open the
   calendar. Click Actions, click Calendar Tools, and then click Calendar
   Profile to find the mail file owner. Make sure that the mail file owner is
   the fully qualified Notes address of the actual user, and not the user's
   alias or some other name. It is best to select the mail file owner from the
   primary name and address book. After you correct the Notes Client
   configuration, the From header will appear as it usually does.

 - The Exchange Notes Connector has built-in message loop detection that is
   enabled by default. There may be cases where the message looping is
   intentional, and in these cases you should disable this feature. Under the
   LME-NOTES section of the .ini file, add the following:

   DISABLETRACECHECKEX = YES | NO

Miscellaneous
-------------

 - When the Exchange Notes Connector starts, a dialog box is displayed that
   indicates that the Exchange Notes Connector cannot find the Rpcdce4.dll file.
   Make sure that the file is in the System path. By default, the LinkAge Setup
   program installs this .dll file in the Microsoft Windows system folder.

 - When the Exchange Notes Connector starts, the following error message may be
   logged in the Browse log:

   Warning {Not found} - Could not obtain the value of the <INI PARAMETER>
   keyword in the <LME PROCESS> section. Using the default value
   '<DEFAULT>'

   You can safely ignore this error message, it simply states that the default
   values will be used for common settings for the Exchange Notes Connector.

 - Sometimes you may be unable to see error messages in the Browse logs. Open
   "Browse Log," then go to "Options" [ASCII 150] "Set Message Level." Make sure
   that the "4 Trouble Shooting Messages" option is set.

 - The Notes Client version 4.6 has not been fully tested with the Exchange
   Notes Connector. There may be compatibility issues between the Exchange Notes
   Connector and the Notes Client and its application programming interface
   (API). If you use the Notes Client 4.6 and you still experience problems
   after you have performed the checks in this article, use the Notes Client
   version 4.52 instead, which has been certified to work with the Exchange
   Notes Connector.

 - Messages that contain graphics that are defined as Notes inline bitmaps are
   sometimes converted to Monochrome. This is a limitation of the Notes RTF
   conversion.

 - Incoming SMTP mail that is addressed to the SMTP proxy address of a Notes
   recipient may return an NDR, and the following entries may be logged:

   1998/04/06 13:20:33- LME-NOTES-MEXOUT(01ec) 3 31500:Sender: ed@dd.com, Size:
   605, Message ID: c=US;a= ;p=Microsoft;l=LME-OSMIUM98040620202NR1B1YB

   mexe(3539) 1998/04/06 13:20:36- LME-NOTES-MEXIN(0241) 3 31500:Sender: System

   Exchange >> mexe(3247)

   This issue is the result of a missing P2 or 822 header. Although most mail
   systems do not require the 822 header in an SMTP message, all of the LinkAge
   (SNADS, Profs, and Notes) connectors expect both a P1 and P2 header.

 - After you install the Notes Client, you may receive the following error
   message:

   DDE server window: NLNOTES.EXE - Application Error
   The instruction at "0x00e3e268" referenced memory at "0xfffffff8". The memory
   could not be "read".
   Click on OK to terminate the application
   Click on CANCEL to debug the application

   The Notes Client reads the registry for Internet settings. Look for the
   following registry key:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet
   Settings\ProxyOverride

   NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
   readability.

   If there is a semicolon (;) along with other information in this value, delete
   the semicolon from this value, and restart the Notes Client.
