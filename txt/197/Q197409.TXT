======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta 98 Encyclopedia for Windows 
 - Microsoft Encarta 98 DVD-ROM Reference Suite for Windows 
 - Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia 99 
 - Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia Deluxe 99 
 - Microsoft Encarta Reference Suite 99 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you remove and reinstall Encarta 98 Encyclopedia or Encarta Encyclopedia
99, you may not see all of the yearbook update files that you downloaded before
you removed the program.

You may also receive one of the following error messages:

Encarta Encyclopedia 99:

   A file is missing and you may have lost some monthly updates. Encarta now
   only knows about the first July Yearbook update

Encarta 98 Encyclopedia:

   A file is missing and you may have lost some monthly updates. Encarta now
   only knows about the first July Yearbook update included with your CD.

NOTE: When you remove Encarta 98, the program prompts you to remove or keep the
yearbook files. If you choose to keep the files, they remain on your hard disk.
When you remove Encarta 99, the program leaves the yearbook files on your hard
disk by default.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because Encarta Encyclopedia is unable to integrate
yearbook update files that have already been integrated.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Verify that your integrated yearbook update (.ybk) files are located in the
   Encarta updates folder on your hard disk.

   By default, Encarta Encyclopedia 99 stores the .ybk files in the following
   folder:

   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Reference\Encarta Encyclopedia 99\Update99

   By default, Encarta 98 Encyclopedia stores the .ybk files in the following
   folder:

   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Reference\Encarta Encyclopedia\Update98

   For information about copying files in Microsoft Windows, please see your
   Windows printed documentation or online Help file.

2. Download a new yearbook update file for your version of Encarta Encyclopedia
   from the following MSN Web site:

   http://encarta.msn.com/downloads

When you are prompted to open the file or save the file to disk, save the
yearbook update file in the appropriate folder on your hard disk for your
version of Encarta Encyclopedia:

Encarta Encyclopedia 99:

   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Reference\Encarta Encyclopedia 99\Update99

Encarta 98 Encyclopedia:

   C:\Program Files\Microsoft Reference\Encarta Encyclopedia\Update98

3. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

4. If you are using Encarta 99, type "ybbst99a.dat" (without the quotation
   marks) in the Named box, and then click Find Now.

   If you are using Encarta 99, type "ybbst98a.dat" (without the quotation marks)
   in the Named box, and then click Find Now.

5. In the list of found files, right-click the Ybbst99a.dat or Ybbst98a.dat
   file, and then click Delete.

6. Close the Find: Files Named <filename> window.

7. Start Encarta Encyclopedia.

8. If you are using Encarta Encyclopedia 99, click Tools, and then click
   Downloads.

   If you are using Encarta 98 Encyclopedia, click Online Features, click
   Yearbook, then click Downloads.

9. Click Troubleshoot, and then click Integrate.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When Encarta 98 Encyclopedia searches for files to integrate, it scans the hard
disk for files that are not integrated. Because the integration process changes
the contents and structure of the file as well as the file name extension, you
cannot make Encarta integrate a file that is already integrated by changing the
file name extension from .ybk to .eyb.
