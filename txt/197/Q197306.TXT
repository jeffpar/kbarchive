SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to troubleshoot Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
functionality in Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0. It is divided into
the following sections:

 - Key Manager

 - Microsoft Management Console (MMC)

 - Standard SSL connectivity

 - SSL with Client Certificates

MORE INFORMATION
================

Key Manager
-----------

Key Manager is an application that allows for the installation of Server
Certificates for the SMTP and WWW services. The following points are important
to remember when you use this application:

 - After you perform any operations in Key Manager, commit the changes. This can
   be done through the Computers menu option or when exiting. If Key Manager is
   closed without saving changes or if the application is left open, then the
   creation, deletion, or changes made to a key will not be implemented.

 - Unless an installed key is associated with an IP Address and Port (this
   includes "Any Unassigned"), the key will not be available to the appropriate
   service.

 - After a change is committed in Key Manager, it is necessary to restart the
   Inetinfo process for proper functionality. To do this, Stop the IIS Admin
   Service in Control Panel Services, and then restart all appropriate
   subordinate services, such as the World Wide Web Publishing service.

Microsoft Management Console (MMC)
----------------------------------

The properties for a Web site include the following important configuration
options:

1. On the Master Properties sheet of Internet Information Server, click the
   ISAPI Filters tab. There should be a listing for "sspifilt" with the Status
   showing a green, upward-pointing arrow and a Priority of "HIGH."

2. On the Web site Properties tab, the SSL Port should be set to 443.

3. On the Secure Communications area of the Directory security tab, click to
   select the "Require secure channel when accessing this resource" check box.

NOTE: If instead of an Edit button being displayed on the Directory Security tab,
the button displays "Key Manager," the WWW Service is unaware of a key for SSL.
If a key is installed already in Key Manager, see the "Key Manager" section of
this document.

Standard SSL Connectivity
-------------------------

If you follow the "Key Manager" and "Microsoft Management Console" sections
above, and SSL is not fully functional, see the following:

 - If a Web browser displays no error and simply times out, the cause may be one
   of the following:

    - A router or firewall on the network is blocking TCP port 443.

    - The Sspifilt.dll ISAPI filter is not loaded properly. See step 1 in the
      Microsoft Management Console section above.

 - If you use Internet Explorer 3.02 and the error "A connection with the server
   could not be established" occurs, the Root Certificate (signer) of your SSL
   key in not installed in the browser.

 - If Microsoft Proxy Server 2.0 is installed on the Internet Information Server
   computer, Web Publishing must be enabled. In addition, if Packet Filtering is
   being used, a packet filter for TCP Port 443 must be added.

 - Secure Sockets Layer does not function properly when you implement HOST
   Headers on a Web site.

The HOST header is packaged in the HTTP request, which is in-turn encrypted in
the TCP packet. The TCP packet is sent to a specific IP address and the HTTP
request is opened by the first Web site bound to that IP. Because many HOST
header Web sites may bound to an IP address, unexpected results may occur.

SSL with Client Certificates
----------------------------

If client authentication is enabled, but not fully functional, see the
following:

 - The Web server returns a 403.7 Client Certificate required message. This
   message is a generic error from the Web server; it can indicate several
   conditions:

    - There is no Client Certificate installed in the browser.

    - The Client Certificate supplied is not yet valid or is corrupt.

 - An empty Client Certificate dialog appears when you access a client
   authentication Web site, which may indicate one of the following conditions:

    - There is no Client Certificate installed in the browser.

    - Service Pack 4 is installed. See the following Knowledge Base article for
      more information:

   Q194788 : Windows NT Service Pack 4 and Client Certificates

NOTE: Due to known issues with the Service Pack 3 version of the Schannel.dll
file, it is highly recommended that you apply Service Pack 4 to any server
relying on SSL functionality.
