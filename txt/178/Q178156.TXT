   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses how to change the default location to which attachments
within a message will be saved.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

The location that attachments are saved to is not a function of the Exchange or
Outlook client. It is a function of the operating system's Program Manager
shell. In the case of Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0, this shell is Explorer.

To change this location requires editing the Registry.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedit.exe for Windows 95/98, Regedt32.exe for
   Windows NT).

2. Select the following Registry key:

   HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ Explorer\User
   Shell Folders

3. Modify the following value by replacing the default directory path with the
   path for the location you want to save attachments in:

   Personal

4. Quit Registry Editor.

5. Restart the Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft Outlook client.
