If you want to delete files that you created in Fine Artist and/or Creative
Writer, there are two possible ways to remove them.

Method 1
--------

Delete the files from within Creative Writer or Fine Artist:

1. Go to the Library (Creative Writer) or Gallery (Fine Artist).

2. Click Get Rid Of Something from McZee's list of options. If the thumbnail
   image of the picture is on the wall, drag the thumbnail to the recycle bin.
   Otherwise, click the Portfolio.

3. Click the file in the Portfolio to select it.

4. Click and drag the thumbnail sketch of the file from the right side of the
   Porfolio to the Recycle Bin and release the sketch.

NOTE: Method 1 works only for your own files, in your own Portfolio. You cannot
recycle/delete other users' files.
