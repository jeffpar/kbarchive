SUMMARY
=======

The unattended setup mode of Windows NT 4.0 does not offer a way to run a
program once the setup is complete. Nevertheless, this functionality may be very
useful if you want to set up other components on your system after the
completion of the unattended setup (for example, running a batch file, launching
a hands-free service pack update, or starting the setup routine of other
products).

This article describes how to run a program once (after an unattended setup has
completed).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Automatically running any kind of program after an unattended setup has
completed is not normally possible. The following steps explain how to run a
program only once after an unattended setup has completed.

Windows NT must be installed with the AutoLogon option enabled so that the system
automatically logs itself onto the network immediately after setup is complete,
thus allowing a session to be automatically opened and a specific program to be
launched.

For additional information about enabling AutoLogon for initial logon after
running Windows NT 4.0 Setup, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q157361 How to Automatically Log On After an Unattended Setup

To set up Windows NT 4.0 and to run a program automatically after the setup has
completed, use one of the following methods:

Method 1
--------

1. Create a new share on a network server and then copy the i386 folder (or
   appropriate platform folder) from the Windows NT 4.0 compact disc to the new
   share.

2. Obtain the Regini.exe program from the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit and place
   it in the shared network installation point.

3. Using a text editor (such as Notepad), create a text file and name it
   Runonce.ini. Save the file to the shared network installation point. In this
   file, create the following entries (making sure to place a carriage return at
   the end of each line):

   \Registry\Machine
           Software
             Microsoft
               Windows
                 CurrentVersion
                   Run
                     RUNBATCH = REG_SZ "BATCH.CMD"

4. Add the following entry to the [Unattended] section of the Unattend.txt
   file:

   OEMPreinstall = Yes

5. Add the following entries to the [GUIUnattended] section of the Unattend.txt
   file:

   DetachedProgram = "%SystemRoot%\System32\REGINI.EXE"
   Arguments = "%SystemRoot%\System32\RUNONCE.INI"

   For additional information about parameters for the Unattend.txt file, please
   see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q155197 Unattended Setup Parameters for Unattend.txt File

6. Save and close the Unattend.txt file.

7. Using a text editor, create a text file and save it to the shared network
   installation point as Cleanup.inf. The contents of the Cleanup.inf file must
   be:

   [Version]
   signature="$CHICAGO$"

   [DefaultInstall]
   DelReg = Delete.Reg

   [Delete.Reg]
   HKLM,"SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run","RUNBATCH"

8. Using a text editor, create a batch file and save it to the shared network
   installation point as Batch.cmd. This batch file can include any command, and
   will be run only once after the unattended setup has completed. The Batch.cmd
   file must also contain the following lines:

   %SystemRoot%\System32\rundll32.exe setupapi,InstallHinfSection
   DefaultInstall 132 %SystemRoot%\System32\cleanup.inf

   NOTE: The above command should be all on one line; the line is wrapped for
   readability.

   Triggering the Cleanup.inf file in this manner prevents the running of the
   Batch.cmd file in future logons.

9. During the first phase of the unattended setup, all system files are
   temporarily copied to C:\$Win_nt$.~ls and C:\$Win_nt$.~bt. The Dosnet.inf
   lists the files that have to be copied to the system.

   Therefore, the next step is to edit the Dosnet.inf and add the following lines
   to the end of the [Files] section:

   d1,REGINI.EXE
   d1,RUNONCE.INI
   d1,BATCH.CMD
   d1,CLEANUP.INF

10. The Txtsetup.sif file is used during the text-mode phase of the unattended
   setup. This file tells the setup process which files have to be copied to
   the hard disk.

   The next step is to modify the Txtsetup.sif file in the shared network
   installation point. Add the following lines to the end of the
   [SourceDisksFiles] section of the Txtsetup.sif file:

   BATCH.CMD   = 1,,,,,,,2,0,0
   REGINI.EXE  = 1,,,,,,,2,0,0
   RUNONCE.INI = 1,,,,,,,2,0,0
   CLEANUP.INF = 1,,,,,,,2,0,0

   Adding these lines causes the files above to be copied to the System32
   directory.

11. Run Setup using the appropriate switches, specifying the Unattend.txt file
   containing the modifications discussed above.

Method 2
--------

1. Create a $oem$ directory under the I386 directory.

2. Create a registry file by exporting the Runonce.ini file out of the registry.
   The file should look similar to the following:

   REGEDIT4
   [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce]
   @="c:\\WinNT\\System32\\Calc.exe"

   NOTE: Replace "C:\\WinNT\\Sytem32\\Calc.exe" with whatever command you want to
   run. Give the file a descriptive name, such as Runonce.reg.

3. Copy Regedit.exe to the $oem$ directory.

4. Use a text editor to create a file named Cmdlines.txt. In this file, add the
   following lines:

   [commands]
   ".\regedit /s runonce.reg"

5. In the Unattend.txt file, make sure you have OEMPREINSTALL set to "Yes".

6. Run unattended setup for Windows NT 4.0.
