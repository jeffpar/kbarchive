   Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

This article provides troubleshooting tips for developers who are incorporating
Microsoft(r) Windows(r) Management Instrumentation (WMI) functionality in their
Windows drivers. For information about implementing WMI in drivers for Windows
2000 and Windows 98, see "Part 9: Supporting WMI" in the Kernel-Model Drivers
Design Guide in the Windows 2000 DDK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Wmicore.mof defines standard data blocks and GUIDs, where the more useful common
data blocks are the failure prediction classes. To avoid syntax errors in
defining structures and GUIDs, use Wmimofck.exe to generate a header file
(Wmidata.h). This tool can be found at %NTDDK%\Bin\Wmimofck.exe.

The Wmimofck.exe tool can generate a Microsoft Visual Basic Script file that you
can run to query classes and properties specified in a driver's .mof file. To
generate a VBscript file, use the following command:

   "wmimofck -tdriver.vbs driver.bmf" (without the quotation marks)

You can then run the resulting script, Driver.vbs, from the command line. When it
finishes running, examine the Driver.log file for the results.

Any property that does not contain data cannot be queried by WMI. In this case,
check that the driver's .mof file has been incorporated into the schema. If so,
check that the driver is receiving WMI I/O Request Packets (IRPs) and completing
them successfully.

The Wmimofck.exe file can also generate Web pages for querying, setting, and
executing methods and receiving events. The Web pages generated can be used as a
template for more sophisticated interactions with devices. To generate Web
pages, use the command:

   "wmimofck -whtml driver.bmf" (without the quotation marks)

The Web pages are generated under the html directory. Note that your default
browser security settings might prevent you from loading the pages from a
network drive.

You can use the tool %Windir%\System32\Wbem\Wbemtest.exe to query individual
classes, change the values of properties, execute methods, and receive events.

Troubleshooting Tips for Specific Problems
------------------------------------------

MOF Doesn't Appear in \Root\Wmi Namespace:

1. Run the Wmimofck.exe tool on the binary .mof file to check that the .mof
   format is correct for WMI. To do this, run the command "wmimofck driver.bmf"
   (without the quotation marks). %Windir%\System32\Wbem\Logs\Mofcomp.log will
   show any errors that occur when you try to add the binary .mof file into the
   schema.

2. The Windows 2000 event log might have a message indicating that the driver
   returned a badly formed WMIREGINFO data structure and thus could not be
   registered.

3. Check the registry path and MofResourceName returned by the driver in
   IRP_MN_REGINFO.

4. Check under the service key to verify that any MofImagePath value that might
   be specified is correct.

5. If using the binary .mof GUID, check that the driver receives an IRP that
   queries for the binary .mof data and that the IRP is completed successfully
   with the correct data and size.

6. Check %windir%\System32\Wbem\Logs\Wmiprov.log for errors.

7. Try to compile the .mof (not .bmf) file manually using Mofcomp. If your .mof
   file is named Driver.mof, then the command would be "mofcomp -N:root/wmi
   driver.mof" (without the quotation marks). See if any interesting error
   messages appear.

8. If Mofcomp succeeds and the .mof file is established in the schema, then most
   likely there is a problem with the WMIREGINFO data structure. A typical
   problem is that a class is derived from a base class that does not exist.

   Important: Delete the classes that were added manually by Mofcomp so that you
   can detect when the .mof file is incorporated in the schema successfully.

Events Are Not Received:

1. Look in the Windows 2000 event log.

2. Look in %Windir%\System32\Wbem\Logs\Wmiprov.log.

3. If the GUID for the event is registered as a static instance name, make sure
   that the InstanceIndex field and the ProviderId field are filled in
   correctly. If the GUID for the event is registered as a dynamic instance
   name, make sure that an instance name is present when the event is fired.

Event References Are Not Received:

1. Look in the Windows 2000 event log.

2. Look in %Windir%\System32\Wbem\Logs\Wmiprov.log.

3. If the driver does not receive IRP_MN_QUERY_SINGLE_INSTANCE immediately after
   firing the event, then most likely there is a problem with the
   WNODE_EVENT_REFERENCE. If the driver receives IRP_MN_QUERY_SINGLE_INSTANCE,
   then the IRP will complete with STATUS_SUCCESS.

4. Check the WNODE_EVENT_REFERENCE structure fired by the driver. The GUID
   specified in WNODE_HEADER should match the TargetGuid in
   WNODE_EVENT_REFERENCE.

5. If the GUID was registered with a static instance name, then the
   WNODE_EVENT_REFERENCE should contain a valid instance index.

6. If the GUID was registered with dynamic instance names, then the
   WNODE_EVENT_REFERENCE should contain a valid instance name string.

MOF Shows Up but Cannot Access Properties or Methods:

1. Run the Wmimofck.exe tool on the binary .mof file to check that the MOF
   format is correct for WMI. To do this, run the command "wmimofck driver.bmf"
   (without the quotation marks).

2. From within Wbemtest, try to query the class. Does the driver receive a WMI
   IRP? If not, then check that the GUID in the .mof file matches the GUID in
   the driver. Double-check that the driver receives an IRP_MN_REGINFO IRP, that
   it succeeds, and that the GUID in question is part of the registration data
   structures and marked as "enabled".

3. If the driver does receive an IRP, ensure that the IRP is completed
   successfully and that the data format for the returned WNODE is correct.

4. If Wbemtest returns an error, click More Information and check the
   Description property for information about the error.

Unregistering in the Context of a WMI IRP:

 - Calling IoWMIRegistrationControl to unregister causes the calling thread to
   block until all WMI IRPs sent to the device object being unregistered are
   completed. This means that a driver should not unregister while processing a
   WMI IRP; it must call to unregister after the IRP has been completed. For
   Windows 2000, there is a limitation that the driver not call to unregister in
   the thread context that the IRP was delivered.

Wmiprov.dll Registry Settings that Control Logging:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

 - WDM Provider will take the directory name from
   HKLM\Software\Microsoft\WBEM\CIMOM\LoggingDirectory.

 - WDM Provider will take maximum file size as specified in
   HKLM\Software\Microsoft\WBEM\CIMOM\Log File Max Size.

 - WDM Provider will disable logging if "0" is the value in
   HKLM\Software\Microsoft\WBEM\CIMOM\Logging.

 - WDM Provider will enable logging if "0" is not the value in
   HKLM\Software\Microsoft\WBEM\CIMOM\Logging.
