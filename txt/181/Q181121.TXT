TITLE   :Enhanced Event Logging for SNA Server Event 9, 12
PRODUCT :Microsoft SNA Server
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1,3.0 SP2
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

To improve the ability to troubleshoot SNA Server Event 9 (subcode 1117) and
Event 12 errors, these events have been enhanced to include the following
additional information:

 - Client Domain

 - Client User (name)

 - LU name (3270 LU)

 - FMI Sense Code

When SNA Server logs an Event 9 (subcode 1117), the SNA Server has detected an
SNA protocol violation by the 3270 emulation product being used. The Event 9
indicates a non-fatal protocol violation which would not cause a user to lose
their 3270 session. If SNA Server detects a nonrecoverable 3270 protocol
violation by the 3270 emulation product, SNA Server logs an Event 12.

Using SNA Server 3.0 (including 3.0 SP1 and SP2), it's not possible to determine
which client workstation caused these problems to occur, making troubleshooting
more difficult. These events have been enhanced so that the specific client user
can be tracked down.

To debug the exact cause of these events, SNA Server 3270 message tracing is
needed on either the server or the client computer.

STATUS

MORE INFORMATION
================

SNA Server 4.0 already includes these enhancements to SNA Server Event 9 and 12.
These changes have been retrofitted to SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) in
order to improve diagnostic capability for the 3.0 product.

Here is the event message text for these enhanced events:

   

   ===============================
   Event ID: 9
   Source:   SNA Server
   Description:
   (<subcode>) A protocol error occurred due to a message sent by a 3270
   emulator or link service

   EXPLANATION
   A protocol error occurred due to a message sent by a 3270 emulator or
   link service.

   SUBCODE INFORMATION
   X'1117'  A 3270 emulator used by the following user caused an error,
   though the user's 3270 session was not interrupted:

      Client Domain: 
      Client User:   
      LU name:       
      FMI Sense Code:

   ===============================

   Event ID: 12
   Source:   SNA Server
   Description:
   A 3270 Session was lost due to a protocol error in the 3270 emulator.

   A user has lost their 3270 session due to a non-recoverable protocol
   error caused by the 3270 emulator being used. The following user
   encountered this error.

      Client Domain:

   ACTION
   To troubleshoot this problem, capture matching SNA client 3270 message
   traces from this user's machine and SNA Server DLC and 3270 message
   traces on the server, and provide them to Microsoft product support.
