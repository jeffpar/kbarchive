SYMPTOMS
========

In a domain controlled by multiple sites, the Copylog.tcf file in the
Smslogon\Config folder on a logon point lists logon point files and the site
that last checked to see if that file should be updated. The Copylog.tcf file
should actually list the site that last updated each logon point file, not the
site that merely checked the logon point file.

Because of the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) that is performed on some client
files, the Systems Management Server (SMS) Service Pack 2 (SP2) client depends
on the Copylog.tcf file working the way in which it was originally designed. The
client code looks at the Copylog.tcf file to determine the site from which it
should obtain the CRC values. In a shared domain where sites are not being
upgraded simultaneously, client components may not be installed or upgraded
because of the CRC mismatches, if an older site most recently performed a logon
point update but a newer site is incorrectly listed in the Copylog.tcf file.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft. This
fix is one of two fixes that are required for SMS 2.0 sites without Service Pack
1 (build 1239) before any site can be upgraded to SMS 2.0 SP2. This fix is
included in the Smsqfe folder on the SP2 CD-ROM. Detailed instructions for
hotfix installation are also included in the Release Notes that accompany the
service pack.

2.0 sites without Service Pack 1 (build 1239), click the article number below to

WARNING: This hotfix may not install on some secondary sites even though the
hotfix installation may appear to run successfully. These hotfixes check for the
existence of the Full Version value in the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Setup

If you have secondary sites that were either installed or upgraded directly from
the primary site, this key may not be created or properly updated. Before
applying this hotfix, please verify the existence of this key on all secondary
sites. The Qxxxxxx.log file that is generated when you install the hotfix will
state that the version is 000. To correct this, manually create or update the
registry value. To create or update this value on secondary sites, use the
following steps.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Using Regedit or Regedt32, locate the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Setup

2. If the Full Version key exists, manually update it using these corresponding
   values:

   Release version (build 1239): 2.00.1239.0000
   SP1 version (build 1380): 2.00.1380.1000

3. If the registry value does not exist, create the value and supply the
   appropriate value from step 2.

Using Regedit:

   a. Right-click the Setup key, and then click New, String Value.

   b. Name this value Full Version.

   c. Double-click the Full Version value and supply the correct version listed
      in step 2.

Using Regedt32:

   a. Click to highlight the Setup key.

   b. On the Edit menu, click Add Value.

   c. For the Value Name, type "Full Version" (without the quotation marks).

      NOTE: The Data Type should be REG_SZ.

   d. Click OK.

   e. You are prompted for the string value. Type the appropriate version from
      step 2, and then click OK.

You should now see the Full Version value listed under the Setup key, which
reflects the version you typed. After you finish this process, continue to apply
the hotfix.

The English-language version of the fix should have the following file attributes
or later:

   Date     Time      Version       Size      File name      Platform
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
   1/4/00   1:36pm    2.0.1239.62   168,816   Nt_logon.dll   I386
   1/4/00   1:37pm    2.0.1239.62   296,208   Nt_logon.dll   Alpha   

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that
contains the above files may also contain additional files.

version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This hotfix is required for interoperability between SMS 2.0 sites without
Service Pack 1 (build 1239) and SMS 2.0 SP2 sites.

NOTE: You must install this hotfix on all SMS sites that share a domain with
other SMS sites.

To install the hotfix update, use the appropriate method.

Method 1: Using the Update Installer
------------------------------------

NOTE: This method is only for I386-based computers.

1. Copy the update folder structure to a share on your network. Q251070.exe is a
   Microsoft Windows Installer file that updates specific files on your site
   server.

2. Log on to your site server using an account with administrative privileges.

3. On the site server, close the SMS Administrator console.

4. Run Q251070.exe and follow the directions in the wizard. You can run the file
   in Quiet mode using the /s switch.

Method 2: Manual Installation
-----------------------------

1. Close the SMS Administrator console and stop the SMS Site Component Manager
   and SMS Executive services.

2. Replace the Nt_logon.dll file in the
   <sms_root_directory>\Bin\<platform> folder with the version
   obtained from the update.

3. Restart the SMS Site Component Manager and SMS Executive services.
