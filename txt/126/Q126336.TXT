SYMPTOMS
========

When you print to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet printer, you may encounter the
following problems:

 - missing characters or parts of images.
 - graphic images print as smeared colors or a black square.

You also may receive the following error message

   <application> caused a general protection fault in module Deskjetc.drv
   at <address>

where <application> is the program you are using and <address> is the
path


RESOLUTION
==========

Try one of the following resolutions.

Resolution 1
------------

Obtain Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet printer driver version 6.1D from
Hewlett-Packard.

Resolution 2
------------

Do not use the DeskJet Automatic printing mode. Other settings, such as Color
Graphics or Black Text give more consistent results.

To change the DeskJet printing mode, do the following:

1. Exit and restart Windows.

2. In the application from which you are printing, choose Print or Printer
   Setup.

3. Select the DeskJet printer. Choose Setup.

4. Select Color Graphics (recommended for color printers) or Grayscale (for
   black-and-white printers). The Black Text setting also may work for some
   problems.

5. Choose OK. Print your document.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you print to HP DeskJet (C) printers, you may get poor results when
printing text or graphics.

This problem can occur with HP DeskJet driver versions 4.0, 4.1, and 5.0.
Previous DeskJet drivers, such as version 3.0 and 3.1, do not have this problem.
Affected printers include: the DeskJet 500, 500c, 550, 550c, 560c, 540, or 520
printers.

Some applications that print DIB graphic images, such as Microsoft Musical
Instruments, cannot print using the DeskJet driver version 5.0. To print these
applications, try using an earlier driver version such as 4.0.

If the method in the Resolution section of this article does not fix the general
protection fault error, the problem could be related to your video driver.
Install the standard VGA driver included with Windows and test your printer. If
the GP fault continues, contact Hewlett-Packard for an updated printer driver.
