MORE INFORMATION
================

CD-ROM

Incorrect Error Message When Running IE 6
------------------------------------------------

For systems running Internet Explorer 6, upon opening the Resource Kit online
documentation, the following message is displayed:

"You are using an old browser. Help may not display correctly. Please upgrade to
the most recent version of IE."

You can continue without error by selecting the "OK" button.


Deployment Planning Guide

Page 612: MetaFrame Upgrade Information Is Incorrect
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 612, under "Terminal Server 4.0 with MetaFrame", there is incorrect
information regarding upgrading with MetaFrame. MetaFrame 1.8 for Windows 2000
will not install on Terminal Server 4.0 and MetaFrame 1.8 for Windows 2000
requires Windows 2000 Terminal Services.

Change:
"Upgrading from Terminal Services 4.0 with MetaFrame is similar to upgrading from
Terminal Server 4.0, but first you need to upgrade to the MetaFrame version for
Windows 2000. After MetaFrame is upgraded, you can follow the same procedure for
upgrading from Terminal Server 4.0 without MetaFrame."

To:
"With MetaFrame for Terminal Server 4.0 installed, you must first install Windows
2000 with Terminal Services, then you should install the latest version of
MetaFrame for Windows 2000."


Internet Explorer 5 Resource Kit

Page 109: Restricted Site Zones Are Not Trusted
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the Internet Explorer 5 Resource Kit, on page 109, the wording in the fourth
bulleted item, which describes the Restricted sites zone should be changed to
indicate that it is for sites that are not trusted.

Change:
"Restricted sites zone - The Restricted sites zone can include all sites that you
know are trusted."

To:
"Restricted sites zone - The Restricted sites zone can include all sites that you
know are not trusted."


Operations Guide

Page 130: CDFS Does Support Lowercase File Names
-----------------------------------------------------------------

In the Windows 2000 Server Operations Guide, on page 130, the statement about
CDFS not supporting lowercase file names is incorrect.

Change:
Windows 2000 provides support for the ISO 9660-compliant CDFS, which supports
long file names as listed in the ISO 9660 Level 2 standards.

When creating a CD-ROM to be used on Windows 2000, you must adhere to the
following standards:

 - All directory and file names must have fewer than 32 characters.

 - All directory and file names must be in capital letters.

 - The directory tree cannot exceed 8 levels from the root.

 - File name extensions are not mandatory.

Important: CDFS adheres to ISO 9660 standards and therefore does not support
lowercase file names. When you use CDFS to access a file or directory with a
lowercase file name on a CD-ROM, you get a "File not found" error message.

To:
Windows 2000 provides support for the ISO 9660-compliant CDFS, which supports
long file names as listed in the ISO 9660 Level 2 standards.

When creating a CD-ROM to be used on Windows 2000, you must adhere to the
following standards:

 - All directory and file names must have fewer than 32 characters.

 - The directory tree cannot exceed 8 levels from the root.

 - File name extensions are not mandatory.


Server Distributed Systems Guide

Page 319: In Figure 6.4 Local USN And usnCreated Should Be 4711
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 319 in Figure 6.4, the local USN numbers as well as usnCreated should be
changed from 1746 to 4711.


Server Distributed Systems Guide

Page 388: Change Forest to Domain
------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 388, under Replication of Password Changes, there are errors in the first
and second paragraphs.

In the last sentence in the first paragraph, change:
"...to a single domain controller in the forest, the PDC emulator."

To:
"...to a single domain controller in the domain, the PDC emulator."

Similarly, in the first sentence of the second paragraph, change:
"...a single domain controller per forest holds the role of PDC emulator."

To:
"...a single domain controller per domain holds the role of PDC emulator."


Server Distributed Systems Guide

Page 714: Reference Does Not Lead To Default Permissions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 714, the first paragraph under the Table indicates that you can find
information on default permissions supplied by each object manager, in the topic
"Objects and Object Managers" in Windows 2000 Server Help. The Help topic has no
such information.

This reference should be omitted.


Server Distributed Systems Guide

Page 729: DACLs For Newly Created Objects Correction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 729, DACLs for Newly Created Objects is incorrectly described.

Step 3 of the process says that if the parent object does not have inheritable
ACEs, the object manager supplies a default DACL. Actually, this is true only
for Active Directory objects, in which case the default DACL is taken from the
Default-Security-Descriptor attribute for the object class in the Active
Directory schema. No other object manager supplies a default DACL.

Thus for non-Active Directory objects, such as file or registry objects,
permissions can be set by the creating process, inherited from the parent
object, or they are acquired from the subject's access token.

Step 3 should read:
"If the parent object has no inheritable ACEs, permissions are acquired from the
subject's access token. The default DACL in an access token gives Full Control
to Creator Owner and System."


Server Distributed Systems Guide

Page 1007: Change First Bullet
---------------------------------------------------------------

On page 1007, the first bulleted item incorrectly states that a domain-based Dfs
root has to be hosted on a Windows 2000 domain controller.

Change:
"It must be hosted on a Windows 2000 domain controller."

To:
"It must be hosted on a Member Server in a Windows 2000 domain."


Server Distributed Systems Guide

Pages 1070 & 1071: Figures 18.3 And 18.4 Are Reversed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On pages 1070 and 1071, in the Server Distributed Systems Guide, figures 18.3 and
18.4 have been reversed. Figure 18.4 should be changed to Figure 18.3 and placed
on page 1070, and Figure 18.3 should be changed to Figure 18.4 and placed on
page 1071.


Server Distributed System Guide

Page 1251: Regivew.exe Not Included On CD
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Server Distributed Systems Guide, on page 1251, in the second paragraph from
the bottom, it states:

"To view .pol files without applying them to the registry, use the Regview.exe
tool located on the Microsoft Windows 2000 Server Resource Kit companion CD."

The Regview.exe tool is not included in the companion CD. To obtain this tool,
please refer to the Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q178665:

http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q178/6/65.asp
(http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q178/6/65.asp)


Server Distributed Systems Guide

Page 1364:  Incorrect Minimum Memory Requirement For Client Hardware
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 1364, under "Client Hardware Requirements",

Change:
"32 MB of RAM minimum (64 MB recommended)."

To:
"64 MB of RAM minimum"


TCP/IP Core Networking Guide

Page 205: Figure 4.3 Message Names Need Updating
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Change:

DHCP Discover
DHCP Offer
DHCP Request
DHCP Pack

To:
DHCPDiscover
DHCPOffer
DHCPRequest
DHCPAck
* Note "P" is deleted and "A" is capitalized in the last name listed.


TCP/IP Core Networking Guide

Page 215: Figure 4.11 Labeled Incorrectly
----------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 215, in Figure 4.11 which depicts the 80/20 Rule Model, the DHCP servers
are reversed. In this figure, DHCP server 1 is labeled 2, and DHCP server 2 is
labeled 1.


TCP/IP Core Networking Guide

Page 217: Multiple Corrections
-----------------------------------------------------------

On page 217, in the Figure 4.12 "DHCP Servers Using Single Scopes", the label
Subnet 1 is incorrect. It should be Subnet A as stated in the paragraph above
the figure.

Also on page 217, the last sentence incorrectly calls out Figure 4.12 instead of
4.13.

On Pages 217-19, in figures 4.12-4.14, the example shown is a Class C address, so
all the example subnet masks are incorrect. The ranges 192.168.1.x, 192.168.2.x,
and 192.168.3.x would actually be entirely different networks, not just subnets.
This can be fixed by changing the example to a Class B address, then change the
subnet mask to 255.255.255.0.


TCP/IP Core Networking Guide

Page 271: Incorrect Subnet Mask
------------------------------------------------------------

Page 271 lists an incorrect default subnet mask of 255.255.255.255 at the bottom
of page. The default subnet mask for a class C address is 255.255.255.0.


TCP/IP Core Networking Guide

Page 319: Record Type Label Missing For ISDN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In table 5.3, on page 319, "ISDN" is missing from the Record Type column. It
should be placed adjacent to RFC 1183.


TCP/IP Core Networking Guide

Pages 436-449: Figures Labeled Incorrectly
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

On pages 436-449, in Figures 6.27, 6.28, 6.29, 6.31, 6.33, 6.34, and 6.35, the
zone acquired.com should not be labeled as a secondary zone. Instead, the zone
reskit.com on server.acquired01-int.com should be labeled as a secondary zone.


TCP/IP Core Networking Guide

Page 712: DLL Files Are In Windows 2000 Directory
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 712, the section titled "Monitoring 802.1p" indicates that the files
Parser.dll and Mac.dll are located in the Windows 2000 Resource Kit Tools Help
tools directory. However, these tools are part of Windows 2000 Server and are
not included with the Resource Kit.

The Tools Help topics for Wins.dll and Windows Load Balancing Server Network
Monitor Parsers both refer to "Parser.ini in the \Netmon subdirectory." In
Windows 2000 Server, this is a sub-directory of %windir%\system32. Mac.ini is in
the %windir%\system32\netmon\parsers directory. Parser.dll and Mac.dll are in
the same directories as their respective .ini files (%windir%\system32\netmon
and %windir%\system32\netmon\parsers).

The steps outlined in the following paragraph from page 712 are not necessary.

"To monitor 802.1p tags, copy the Parser.dll file from the Microsoft(r)
Windows(r) 2000 Resource Kit Tools Help tools directory to the root directory of
your Netmon installation directory. Next, copy the Mac.dll file from the same
tools directory to the Parsers subdirectory under your Netmon installation
directory. Once these files have been copied, restart Netmon."


TCP/IP Core Networking Guide

Page 738: Perf2MIB Utility Has Been Discontinued
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 738, under "Using System Monitor", the text states that the Perf2MIB tool
is provided on the Windows 2000 Resource Kit companion CD.

This tool is not included on the Resource Kit CD. It has been discontinued.
Microsoft will make no further fixes to this utility, nor will Microsoft release
it again.
