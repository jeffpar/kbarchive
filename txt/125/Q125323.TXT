======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
 - Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0 
 - Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Windows with Network Client version 3.0 for MS-DOS, the following
error message appears:

   File Error
   Cannot find NETAPI.DLL

When you choose Close, the following appears:

   File Error
   Cannot find PMSPL.DLL

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs in one of the following situations:

1. If LAN Manager version 2.0 Enhanced driver (LANMAN.DRV) is installed as the
   network driver in Windows version 3.1 Setup.

2. If LAN Manager version 2.1 Enhanced driver (LANMAN21.DRV) is installed as the
   network driver in Windows version 3.1 Setup and the network is currently
   running. If the network is not running when Windows starts, the network
   driver for "Microsoft Network (or 100% compatible)" (MSNET.DRV) is installed.
   However, Windows version 3.1 Setup displays that LAN Manager version 2.1
   Enhanced driver is installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

1. Start Windows Setup (either from the Main group in Windows or from the
   WINDOWS directory in MS-DOS).

2. Change the network to "Microsoft Network (or 100% compatible)."

3. Restart Windows.
