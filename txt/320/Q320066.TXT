TITLE   :SMS: A Large .tmp File Is Created When You Install a Client
PRODUCT :Microsoft Systems Management Server
PROD/VER::2.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install or upgrade a client computer that is running Systems Management
Server (SMS) 2.0, a large temporary (.tmp) file may be created in the
%SystemRoot%\MS\SMS\Core\Bin folder on the client computer. Typically, this file
is named ~glh000*.tmp. When this issue occurs, Clicore.exe may use 90 percent or
more of the client's CPU resources. The .tmp file grows until the client runs
out of hard disk space, and you receive an error message. The error message
states that the client installation did not succeed and to contact your
administrator.

CAUSE
=====

This issue may occur if the Clicore.exe file becomes corrupted as it is copied
to the client. This issue may also occur if the Clicore.exe file on the site
server, client access point (CAP), logon point, or client is corrupted. The
Clicore.exe file may be corrupted if any of the following conditions exist:

 - The Clicore.exe file has a different time and date stamp than the Clicore.exe
   file in the SMS 2.0 source.

 - The Clicore.exe file is a different size than the Clicore.exe file in the SMS
   2.0 source.

 - When you run the "clicore.exe /x" command from a command prompt, a list of
   client installation files that are contained in the Clicore.exe file that are
   available for extraction does not appear.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Corrupted Clicore.exe files have occurred in two scenarios:

 - The more common variation of this problem is addressed in hotfix Q287990. In
   this case, the corruption occurs during the remote client installation. The
   Q287990 hotfix includes changes to the server-side components that are
   responsible for remote client installation.

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q287990 Large .tmp File Is Created When You Install or Upgrade an SMS
   2.0-based Client

 - The hotfix that is described in this article addresses a less common
   variation of the problem. In this case, files may become corrupted while the
   client copies files to itself.

You can apply both of these hotfixes if you suspect that you are experiencing the
issue that is described in this article. The hotfixes are complementary; they
contain different files. The hotfix that is described in this article contains
client-side files. The Q287990 hotfix contains server-side files.
