======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft MapPoint 2001 
 - Microsoft Streets and Trips 2001 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to enable the Global Positioning System (GPS) features in
Streets and Trips 2001 or Microsoft MapPoint 2001, you may receive the following
error message:

   No GPS device found on this machine. Verify your GPS device is connected and
   turned on. Choose Configure GPS Receiver from the GPS menu to ensure that
   your device is attached properly.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if any of the following conditioning is true:

 - The GPS Device is not plugged into your computer.

 - The GPS add-in is not configured to the correct port.

 - The GPS device is not set to NMEA 2.0 compliance.

 - The GPS device is plugged into the communications (COM) port that is in use
   by another program.

 - The computer has infrared ports that have the same interrupt request (IRQ) as
   the COM port.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow the troubleshooting steps below.

Make Sure the GPS Device Is Configured Properly
-----------------------------------------------

The GPS device should be configured to the following settings:

1. On the Tools menu in Expedia Streets and Trips 2001 or in MapPoint 2001,
   point to GPS, and then click Configure GPS Receiver.

2. Select an available communications (COM) port from the list, and then click
   Next.

3. Click OK.

The device should meet the following requirements:

 - INTERFACE should be NMEA/NMEA.

 - The Standard should be NMEA 0183 2.0.

 - The baud rate should be 4800.

Check the GPS Device in HyperTerminal
-------------------------------------

1. Start HyperTerminal.

2. On the "Make new connection" screen, type 'test' into the field name and
   click OK.

3. On the next screen, in the "connect using" box, select "Direct to Com X"
   where X is either 1 or 2. Click OK.

4. On the Port Setting screen, change "Bits per second" to 4800 and "flow
   control" to "none".

5. Click OK.

At this point you should start seeing a continual stream of data, which looks
something like this:

$GPRMB,A,,,,,,,,,,,,V*71
$GPGGA,225224,3400.000,N,06854.375,E,1,07,2.0,638.3,M,-37.5,M,,*6D
$GPGSA,A,3,06,10,17,,22,23,,26,30,,,,4.3,2.0,3.0*33

$GPGSV,3,3,09,30,24,202,42,,,,,,,,,*43
$PGRME,15.0,M,22..5,M,15.0,M*1B
$PGRMM,WGS 84*06

If the data is obviously garbled, as in the following

lkdxflkhglkjhflkllkj^%^%#$*(%)%)()($)()(___$%()*)#$%___%(*)#(*()*
#*#$(*)(*$^________$^(
*($*$(^________$#*^%)$

__%*($N+BW)$_^N^N0964w--___#(*^%NB+W{$=6n0BW(*n4){)(Wu6n

there is probably a communication problem between the GPS and the computer.

Occasionally, problems such as these can be resolved by modifying the settings of
the GPS or the serial port. If this does not resolve the issue, contact your GPS
manufacturer.

Clean Boot the Computer
-----------------------

Clean boot your computer. To do this, use the appropriate method for your version
of Microsoft Windows.

Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition (Me):

1. Click Start, click Run, type "msconfig" (without the quotation marks) in the
   Open box, and then click OK.

2. On the General tab, click "Selective startup".

3. Click to clear all of the check boxes under "Selective startup".

4. On the "Startup" tab, click to select the *StateMgr check box.


5. Click OK. When you are prompted to restart your computer, click Yes. After
   the computer restarts, click Start, click Run, type "msconfig" (without the
   quotation marks) in the Open box, and then click OK.

   IMPORTANT: Look closely at the General tab to ensure that the check boxes you
   cleared are still cleared. Proceed to step 6 if none of the check boxes is
   selected. If you see an unavailable check box (appears dimmed), your computer
   is not truly "clean-booted" and you may need assistance from the manufacturer
   of the program that places a check mark back into Msconfig.

6. After you verify that your computer is clean-booted in step 5, you can
   isolate the issue. If the original issue does not reoccur after the clean
   boot, select one item at a time under "Selective startup", and then restart
   the computer to see if the additional entry reproduces the original issue.

How to Return from a Clean Boot State
-------------------------------------

1. Click Start, click Run, type "msconfig" (without the quotation marks) in the
   Open box, and then click OK.

2. On the General tab, click "Normal startup".

3. Click OK. Click Yes when you are prompted to restart your computer.

Microsoft Windows 98:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "msconfig" (without the quotation marks), and then
   click OK.

3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the
   following check boxes:
    - Process Config.sys File

    - Process Autoexec.bat File

    - Process Winstart.bat File (if available)

    - Process Win.ini File

    - Load Startup Group Items

4. Click OK. When you are prompted to restart the computer, do so.

number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q192926 How to Perform Clean-Boot Troubleshooting for Windows 98

Microsoft Windows 95:

1. Restart the computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, press
   the F8 key, and then select Command Prompt Only from the Startup menu.

2. At the command prompt, type "win" (without the quotation marks), and then
   press ENTER. Press and hold down the SHIFT key until the Windows startup
   sequence is complete.

3. Disable any anti-virus or disk tool programs installed on the computer.

   For information about how to disable these programs, see the printed or online
   documentation for the program.

4. Quit all running programs except Explorer and Systray. To do this, press
   CTRL+ALT+DELETE, click the program that you want to quit, and then click End
   Task. If you receive a message that the program is busy or not responding,
   click End Task again. Repeat this step to quit all programs except Explorer
   and Systray.

Decrease the COM Port Buffer
----------------------------

The buffer settings are located in the Device Manager under the appropriate COM
port's "Advanced Settings" button. Decreasing these settings may allow a GPS to
be seen or to function more reliably within the application.

Issues That Are BIOS Related
----------------------------

The following contains suggestions for changing settings in the basic
input/output system (BIOS). Improperly setting some options in the BIOS could
cause significant problems on the system. Please consult your reference manual
when working in the BIOS and use caution.

Some BIOS support what is called "serial timeout." If this is turned on, problems
may arise. Set this to OFF. Make sure that the resource hexadecimal address and
IRQ match those in Device Manager as well.
Also note that Infrared ports can often cause trouble with GPS detection. If the
option is available, DISABLE the infrared port.

Check IR Port and Modem Settings
--------------------------------

In some cases, it may be necessary to disable the IR port or to disable or remove
an internal modem (scanner card, bus mouse card, and so on) which may be sharing
a virtual COM port with the computers external serial port. For example, if a
modem that is installed uses COM3, it may not be possible for a GPS device to be
seen within the software if the GPS is attached to COM1.
