SUMMARY
=======

Recognized and trusted organizations, called Certificate Authorities (CA), issue
certificates to individuals and corporations. These certificates contain not
only details about the holder and their public key, but also the public key of
the CA. Because reputable CAs apply rigorous checks to verify that applicants
are actually who they claim to be, you can deem the information in the
certificates they issue to be accurate. They also make available (through their
Web site) their own public key certificate. This is their root certificate. Many
browsers come with the popular CA root certificates already installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before the CA issues a user with their own personal certificate, it digitally
signs the certificate using the CA's private key. This means that if you can
decrypt this signature using the CA's public key, you know that it is a real
valid certificate from that CA.

Verifying Certificates

One party can provide the other with their certificate, and at the same time send
them an extract of it, which is encrypted with that party's private key. This
extract is called the message digest. The recipient can then check that they are
who they claim to be by decrypting the message digest using the public key in
the certificate, and then verifying that the results agree with the certificate
contents. If they do, the sender must know the private key that matches this
certificate, and they must be the legitimate holder of the certificate. All of
this happens automatically.

If the real holder of the certificate has allowed someone else to discover their
private key, then security is compromised. It is very important to keep your own
private keys safe.

Using Digital Certificates

One way of easily adding security to your DNA applications is to use certificates
in your communication with clients. This can be done in one of following ways:

 - You can use digital certificates to authenticate visitors and to allow them
   to authenticate your server, so that both sides are convinced that they
   actually are connected to who they think they are.

-or-

 - You can also use digital certificates to encrypt the communication by using
   the other party's public keys that they contain. However, asymmetric (public
   key) encryption is slow. The best practice is to use a combination of
   encryption methods to make it all work much more quickly.

Server certificates and client certificates are fundamentally the same. IIS can
use the certificates that are stored in the browser, which is one reason why you
must install Internet Explorer 4.0 on your server when you install the Windows
NT 4.0 Option Pack.

Authentication and Windows NT Account Mapping

You can configure IIS to accept certificates for a virtual site or directory, and
even force IIS to require them. This is done on the Internet Server Manager
(ISM) Directory Security tab by selecting Edit in the Secure Communications
dialog box, and then choosing Key Manager. When IIS connects with a client that
requires access to this directory, it sends the client its own (server)
certificate together with a request for the client's certificate. The client
checks the server's certificate against its copy of the appropriate CA root
certificate, and then sends confirmation of success back to the server together
with a copy of its client certificate. The server can then verify the client's
certificate against its copy of the appropriate CA root certificate, and then
when the result is verified, the server starts normal communication with the
client.

IIS can use the contents of the client's certificate to map that user to an
existing Windows NT user account on the server. This can be done as a basic
one-to-one mapping, where a separate account is required for each client. In the
Secure Communication dialog box, click Edit, and then select the Enable Client
Certificate Mapping option.

You can also set up a many-to-one mapping on the Advanced tab of this dialog box.
In this case, certain parts of the certificate are matched (rather like
wildcards) to a single user account.
