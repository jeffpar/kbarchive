-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Version 3.5.0 of the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks Mail Integrity Check
(MAILINT.EXE) utility ships in the version 3.5 Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
Resource Kit. The utility can be used to check for a variety of missing or
corrupt mail database files and directories. It is a read-only utility, and it
does not attempt to fix any files that fail the integrity check. This utility
can be run while users are working on the postoffice as it does not open or
write to any mail database files.

MAILINT.EXE consists of the three modules described below: Directory Check, File
Existence Check, and File Integrity Check. This utility is designed with
Microsoft Visual Basic version 3.0 and requires VBRUN300.DLL to run.

VBRUN300.EXE is available from the Microsoft FTP Web site. For additional
information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Also refer to Chapter 5 of the version 3.5 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
Resource Kit for other utilities available.

Directory Check
---------------

Directory Check will verify the existence of 51 total directories. They include
the following directories located under the root directory of \MAILDATA:

   \XTN  \CAL
   \FOLDERS \GLB
   \GRP     \HLP
   \INF     \INI
   \KEY     \LOG
   \USR     \MBG
   \MEM     \MMF
   \NME     \P1
   \TPL     \MAI
   \ATT

The following directories located under the \ATT directory of \MAILDATA:

   \AT0  \AT1
   \AT2  \AT3
   \AT4  \AT5
   \AT6  \AT7
   \AT8  \AT9
   \ATA  \ATB
   \ATC  \ATD
   \ATE  \ATF

And the following directories located under the \MAI directory of \MAILDATA:

   \MA0  \MA1
   \MA2  \MA3
   \MA4  \MA5
   \MA6  \MA7
   \MA8  \MA9
   \MAA  \MAB
   \MAC  \MAD
   \MAE  \MAF

File Existence Check
--------------------

The File Existence Check will verify the existence of a core set of Mail
postoffice files. They include the following files located under the \GLB
directory of \MAILDATA:

   ACCESS.GLB     ACCESS2.GLB
   ACCESS3.GLB    CONTROL.GLB
   GLOBAL.GLB     GROUP.GLB
   GRPMEM.GLB     MASTER.GLB
   NETPO.GLB         NETWORK.GLB
   PROCESS.GLB    REQCONF.GLB
   RNETSEM.GLB    SRVCONF.GLB
   TID.GLB

As well as the following files located under the \NME directory of \MAILDATA:

   ADMIN.NME    ADMINSHD.NME

The following files located under the \GRP directory of \MAILDATA:

   ADMIN.GRP    ADMINSHD.GRP

File Check will verify that each existing .KEY file has a corresponding .MBG
file, and it will verify that each existing .MBG file has a corresponding .KEY
file.

File Integrity Check
--------------------

File Integrity Check will compare (calculate) the file size of the following
files with the correct file size:

   *.GLB     *.GRP
   *.XTN     *.KEY
   *.MBG     *.NME
   *.USR

Please reference the On-line Help Database Description for a list of the files
and record sizes within each of those files.

Error Messages
--------------

Below is a list of errors that the utility will detect, along with a description
for each.

 - ADMIN.GRP/ADMINSHD.GRP sizes differ. If the ADMIN.GRP file size differs from
   the ADMINSHD.GRP, make a backup of ADMIN.GRP, and copy the ADMINSHD.GRP over
   the ADMIN.GRP.

 - ADMIN.NME/ADMINSHD.NME sizes differ. If the ADMIN.NME file size differs from
   the ADMINSHD.NME, make a backup of ADMIN.NME, and copy the ADMINSHD.NME over
   the ADMIN.NME.

 - Corrupt File. A file is determined to be corrupt if the file size does not
   divide evenly with the record size for that file. For more information on the
   record sizes, from the Mail menu, choose Help. Then select Database
   Description. Please have the Mail Administrator contact Product Support with
   errors found.

 - Directory Is a File. A file exists in the place of a directory. For example,
   a file with the name AT8 exists in the \ATT directory. AT8 should be a
   subdirectory of ATT, not a file. Please have the Mail Administrator contact
   Product Support with errors found.

 - Directory Does Not Exist. A directory is missing from the Mail database. Use
   the MS- DOS MKDIR command to create the missing directory.

 - File Does Not Exist. The File Does Not Exist error means that one of the core
   postoffice files is missing from the Mail database. A list of the files
   checked are:

      ACCESS.GLB      ACCESS2.GLB
      ACCESS3.GLB CONTROL.GLB
      GLOBAL.GLB  GROUP.GLB
      GRPMEM.GLB  MASTER.GLB
      NETPO.GLB   NETWORK.GLB
      PROCESS.GLB REQCONF.GLB
      RNETSEM.GLB SRVCONF.GLB
      TID.GLB  ADMIN.NME
      ADMINSHD.NME   ADMIN.GRP
      ADMINSHD.GRP

 - File Does Not Exist - RNETSEM.GLB. The file RNETSEM.GLB is 4 bytes and is
   used for synchronizing the generation of RNETWORK.GLB by the External mail
   program. If this file is missing, the first run of External mail program will
   create this file.

 - KEY Exists Without MBG. Every user will have a hexid.KEY and hexid.MBG file.
   This program will gather the list of .KEY files and verify a corresponding
   .MBG file exists. This error will appear when the hexid.MBG file is missing
   from the MBG directory.

 - MBG Exists Without KEY. Every user will have a hexid.MBG and hexid.KEY file.
   This program will gather the list of .MBG files and verify a corresponding
   .KEY file exists. This error will show when the hexid.KEY file is missing
   from the KEY directory.

 - Missing SRVCONF.GLB. This file should exist only if the postoffice is the
   Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync) server. The SRVCONF.GLB file is the
   Dir-Sync server's configuration file.

 - PO Not Found at <location>. If you receive this error after selecting
   the start button, then the program could not find a MASTER.GLB in the GLB
   directory of the path entered into the Location of PO dialog box. Please
   enter a valid directory for the postoffice.
