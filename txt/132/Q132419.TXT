The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows 1995 edition 
 - Microsoft Bookshelf '95 for Windows 95 
 - Microsoft Bookshelf 1996-97 for Windows 
 - Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c 
 - Microsoft Works, versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to send a fax using WinFax Pro version 4.0 from Word for
Windows, version 6.0 or Works for Windows, version 3.0, the computer exhibits
one of the following behaviors:

 - Stops responding (hangs) and requires a restart

 - Stack fault error occurs

 - General protection (GP) fault error occurs

 - The error message "Application error: msworks caused a stack fault in
   Wfxhelp.dll module at 0002:00cf" occurs

This problem has also been reported to occur when using Bit Fax Pro, a product of
Cheyenne Software.

CAUSE
=====

Many products, including Bookshelf, install a version of CTL3DV2.DLL that is
incompatible with Delrina WinFax Pro 4.0. Delrina WinFax Pro 4.0 requires
version 2.05 of CTL3DV2.DLL with a file date of 4/19/94 and a decompressed file
size of 21,648 bytes.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove CTL3DV2.DLL from your Windows System folder and replace it with the one
from the Microsoft Word 6.0 disks or the one from the Works 3.0 disks. The
required CTL3DV2.DLL is version 2.05 with a file date of 4/19/94 and a
decompressed file size of 21,648 bytes.

Replacing CTL3DV2.DLL from Your Word 6.0 Disks
----------------------------------------------

Insert Disk 1 of the Word 6.0 disks, type the following at an MS-DOS command
prompt and press ENTER:

   "extract <drive>:\word1.cab /L c:\windows\system ctl3dv2.dll" (without
   the quotation marks)

where <drive> is the drive containing the Word disk 1 and c:\windows is
your Windows folder.

Replacing CTL3DV2.DLL from Your Office Disks or CD-ROM
------------------------------------------------------

1. Insert the Office 4.3 Professional disk 24, or the Office 4.3 Professional
   CD-ROM.

2. Change to the directory containing Extract.exe. Extract.exe is on disk 1 of
   the Office disks and in the \Setup.adm\Disk1 subdirectory of the Office
   CD-ROM.

3. Type the following at an MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER:

   "extract <path>\msoff24.cab /L c:\windows\system ctl3dv2.dll" (without
   the quotation marks)

   where <path> is the path to the Msoff24.cab file, and c:\windows is your
   Windows subdirectory. On the disk-based version of Office 4.3, this will be
   the floppy disk drive containing disk 24. On the Office 4.3 CD-ROM, this will
   be the \Setup.adm\Disk24 folder of the CD-ROM.

Replacing CTL3DV2.DLL from Your Works 3.0 Disks
-----------------------------------------------

Use one of the following methods.

Method 1:

1. Change to the directory containing Decomp.exe.

   NOTE: In a complete installation, Decomp.exe is installed into the
   \Msworks\Setup folder.

2. Insert Disk 3 if you are using Works 3.0, or Disk 4 if you are using Works
   version 3.0a or 3.0b, and type the following at an MS-DOS command prompt and
   press ENTER:

   "decomp -f <drive>:\ctl3dv2.dl_ c:\windows\system\ctl3dv2.dll" (without
   the quotation marks)

   where <drive> is the drive letter where the Works disk is located, and
   c:\windows is your Windows folder.

Method 2:

Rename the CTL3DV2.DLL file and run the Works maintanence mode installation. For
information about renaming files in Windows, see your Windows printed
documentation or online Help.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Word for Windows may correct itself if the file Fonttool.wll is
removed from the \Winword\Startup folder. However, removing this file disables
the Font Assistant functionality.

After you replace the Bookshelf-installed CTL3DV2.DLL with version 2.05, you are
able to use WinFax Pro 4.0 from Works and from Microsoft Word, even with
Fonttool.wll installed.

Bookshelf 1995 and 1996-97 use CTL3DV2.DLL for the System Info application,
MSINFO.EXE. Bookshelf and System Info work with CTL3DV2.DLL version 2.05.
