TITLE   :XLCN: Err Msg: Setup.ini Forced to Quit Product
PRODUCT :Microsoft Exchange
PROD/VER:3.2 4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbsetup

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a network administrative setup, (setup /a), to install the
Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 3.x source files on a network drive from a
Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 3.11 workstation, you might receive the
following error message:

   Setup.ini Forced to Quit product.

CAUSE
=====

You will receive one of the error messages if either of the following is true:

 - The Microsoft Exchange client Setup program is unable to change the
   attributes of the file to READ-ONLY. This might be because you don't have the
   appropriate write privileges to do this.

   -or-

 - The Microsoft Exchange client Setup program is able to change the attributes
   of the file to READ-ONLY, but the network returns the message that the change
   was not successful.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you receive this error message, do the following to correct the problem:

 - Delete the original Setup.ini from your drive.

   If you receive the error message above, restart the workstation and rerun the
   Microsoft Exchange client Setup program. If it continues to fail, it may be
   because the original Setup.ini file is still present as a Read-Only file. To
   resolve this problem, delete the original Setup.ini file from your hard disk.

 - Modify the Net.cfg or Shell.cfg files, Novell workstations only:

   1. Locate the Shell.cfg or Net.cfg on the workstation from which you are
      running the administrative setup of Office 4.0. If this file does not
      exist, create it using a text editor and place it in the same directory as
      Netx.com.

   2. Open the Shell.cfg or Net.cfg file in a text editor. In the DOSREQUESTER
      section, change the line that reads:

         READ ONLY COMPATIBILITY=ON

      to

         READ ONLY COMPATIBILITY=OFF

      If this line does not exist, create it. The entry must be indented (default
      3 spaces) or it will be seen as an invalid section heading and not be
      used.

      For example:

         NETWARE DOSREQUESTER
            READ ONLY COMPATIBILITY=OFF


      Read Only Compatibility = Off | On (default Off)

      This is not a new parameter, but the default has been changed with release
      1.20 of the DOS Requester. In the last major release of the Requester this
      parameter defaulted to On. However, this default setting caused problems
      with a number of applications, so the parameter is now set to Off by
      default.

   3. If the workstation is using the NetWare VLM shell version 1.1, (Netware
      3.11), continue with the steps in the following section "VLM version 1.1".
      If you are not running VLM version 1.1, continue with steps 4-6 below.

      NOTE: In many cases, the procedure described in the section "VLM Version
      1.1" will not be required. This process is time consuming. Continue with
      steps 4 through 6 below and perform the VLM procedure only if the problem
      persists.

   4. Log off of the network, restart the workstation, and connect to the server
      again.

   5. Log on to the network, start Windows, and run setup /a from the client
      source disk to establish the client setup share point to install the
      application.

   6. When the application is installed, change the option in the Shell.cfg or
      Net.cfg file back to =ON in case there are applications on the system that
      require this setting.

 - VLM Version 1.1

   If you are using VLM version 1.1, you can obtain this updated version of the
   VLM shell. Novell has made these files available on CompuServe in the
   NOVFILES forum and on FTP.NOVELL.COM. VLMUP2.EXE (a self-extracting file)
   contains all the updated VMS (Pre-release v1.20), the updated ODI
   drivers(LSL.COM and IPXODI.COM), the updated Mills, and other associated
   files.

   To find the version of VLM that you are using, type the following at the
   MS-DOS prompt:

   VLM /d

If this command presents too much information at one time, type the following:

   VLM /d | more

If you are running VLM version 1.1, use the following steps to resolve this
problem (Note that these steps should be taken after you complete the first two
steps in the Modify NET.CFG or SHELL.CFG Files section above):

   1. Remove the VLM shell and use the NETX shell to complete the administrative
      setup. If you cannot use NETX, you can install the VLM shell version 1.0.
      However, because reinstalling VLM version 1.0 is very time consuming,
      using NETX is the preferred method.

   2. Log off of the network, restart the workstation and connect to the server
      again.

   3. Log on to the network, start Windows, and run setup /a from the client
      source disk to establish the client setup share point to install the
      application.

   4. When the application is installed, change the option in the Shell.cfg or
      Net.cfg file back to =ON in case there are applications on the system that
      require this setting.

MORE INFORMATION
================

READ ONLY COMPATIBILITY is an option used by the Novell workstation redirector,
Netx.com. This option determines whether or not an attempt to open a read-only
file for write access fails. Prior to Novell network version 2.1x, a program
could open a read-only file for write access without generating an error
message. With network version 2.1 and later versions, write access is not
granted when opening a read-only file. With the READ ONLY COMPATIBILITY option
in the Shell.cfg or Net.cfg file set to ON, the workstation redirect allows
write access to a read-only file without generating an error message.
