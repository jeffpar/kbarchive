======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 
 - Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a Visual Basic 4.0 16-bit client that early-binds to a Visual Basic
4.0 32-bit server and you replace the Visual Basic 4.0 32-bit server with a
binary-compatible Visual Basic 5.0 or 6.0 32-bit server, you receive the
following message when you try to run the client:

   "Run-time error '-2147319784 (80028018)' OLE Automation error"

CAUSE
=====

A Visual Basic 4.0 16-bit client can make use of the services of a Visual Basic
4.0 32-bit local server (EXE OLE Server) with both early- and late- binding.
However, a Visual Basic 4.0 16-bit client can only late-bind to a Visual Basic
5.0 or 6.0 32-bit server (ActiveX EXE).

The type library of the Visual Basic 5.0 or 6.0 32-bit server does not appear in
the references list of the Visual Basic 4.0 16-bit design environment.

This also applies if you are upgrading a Visual Basic 4.0 32-bit local server to
a Visual Basic 5.0 or 6.0 ActiveX EXE and your server is going to be used by a
Visual Basic 4.0 16-bit client. You will have to use late- binding in the Visual
Basic 4.0 16-bit application. This is true even if you simply recompile the
project in Visual Basic 5.0 or 6.0 and set the component to be binary compatible
to the existing Visual Basic 4.0 32-bit component.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use late binding with CreateObject as shown below.

================

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Start 32-bit Visual Basic 4.0.

2. Remove Form1 and insert a module (Module1) and a class module (Class1).

3. Add the procedure Sub Main() to Module1.

4. Set Class1's Name property to CServer, Instancing property to 2- Creatable
   MultiUse and Public property to True.

5. On the Tools menu, click Options. In the Options dialog box, select the
   Project tab. Change Project Name to Server32, set StartMode to OLE Server,
   and enter an Application Description of "32-Bit Visual Basic Server."

6. Paste the following code into the General Declarations section of the CServer
   (formerly Class1) class module:

          Private mName As String

          Private Sub Class_Initialize()
             mName = "Default name"
          End Sub
          Public Property Get sName() As String
             sName = mName
          End Property
          Public Property Let sName(vNewValue As String)
             mName = vNewValue
          End Property

7. Save the BAS module as Server32M.bas, the class module as Server32C.cls, and
   the project as Server32.vbp, and then compile the project as Server32.exe.

8. Exit Visual Basic 4.0 32-bit.

9. Start 16-bit Visual Basic 4.0.

10. On the Tools menu, click References and then check 32-Bit Visual Basic
   Server. You may have to use the Browse button to add Server32.exe to the
   references list.

11. Add the controls listed in the table below to your form (Form1). Change the
   name property of these controls to the value listed in the Updated Name
   column and change the caption property of those controls to the value listed
   in the Updated Caption column.

       Control Type   Default Name   Updated Name  Updated Caption
       -----------------------------------------------------------------
       TextBox        Text1          txtEarly
       TextBox        Text2          txtLate
       Label          Label1                       lblEarly
       Label          Label2                       lblLate
       CommandButton  Command1       cmdEarly      Change Early's Name
       CommandButton  Command2       cmdLate       Change Late's Name

12. Change Form1's Name property to frmTest.

13. Paste the following code into the General Declarations section of frmTest
   (formerly Form1):

          Dim LateObj As Object
          Dim EarlyObj As New Server32.CServer

          Private Sub cmdLate_Click()
             On Error GoTo LateErrHandler:
             With LateObj
                .sName = txtLate
                lblLate = .sName
             End With
             Exit Sub
          LateErrHandler:
             MsgBox Err.Number & "  " & Err.Description
          End Sub
          Private Sub cmdEarly_Click()
             On Error GoTo EarlyErrHandler:
             With EarlyObj
                .sName = txtEarly
                lblEarly = .sName
             End With
             Exit Sub
          EarlyErrHandler:
             MsgBox Err.Number & "  " & Err.Description
          End Sub
          Private Sub Form_Load()
             On Error GoTo LoadErrHandler:
             Set LateObj = CreateObject("server32.CServer")
             lblEarly.Caption = EarlyObj.sName
             Exit Sub
          LoadErrHandler:
             MsgBox Err.Number & "  " & Err.Description
          End Sub

14. Test and then save the form as Client16.frm and the project as Client16.vbp.

15. Compile the project as Client16.exe and then exit Visual Basic 4.0 16-bit.
   Run Client16.exe and verify that both the early and late buttons work
   correctly.

16. Copy Server32.exe to Server32B.exe (the backup copy) and copy the Server32
   project files to a new (backup) directory.

17. Open the original Server32 project in 32-bit Visual Basic 4.0.

18. Select the Options menu item from the Tools menu, and on the resulting
   Options dialog, select the Project tab. Under Compatible OLE Server, use the
   ellipsis button ("...") to select Server32B.exe (the backup copy of
   Server32.exe).

19. Recompile the project, making sure it over-writes the original copy of
   Server32.exe, and then exit Visual Basic 4.0 32-bit.

20. Run Client16.exe. It should still work if you have followed these steps
   correctly.

21. Using Visual Basic 5.0 or 6.0, recompile the Server32 project into
   Server32.exe and make sure it over-writes the original copy of Server32.exe.

22. Run Client16.exe.

RESULT: You should receive one of the following error messages:

   Error 429, 429 OLE Automation server can't create object

   -2147319784 OLE Automation Error

After clearing the error message box, click the "Change Early's Name" button
(early-bound to server) which should produce the same error. Clicking on the
"Change Late's Name" button (late-bound to server) should work.
