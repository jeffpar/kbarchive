SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience poor Audio Video Interleave (.avi), full-motion video
performance with the S3flat.drv video driver. Pictures and images may be
difficult to distinguish and the overall video image quality may be poor.

This issue can occur if you are using the driver version 3.10.061 (dated
11/17/93) and the Windows display resolution set to 1024 X 768 in 64K- color
mode.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use a lower display resolution and a lower color depth
setting.

For example, if you use a 640x480 resolution setting and 256 colors, the videos
are shown correctly. This problem does not occur on computers that are using the
Microsoft Windows 95/98 S3 video drivers.

For information about changing video display settings in Windows, see your
Windows printed documentation or online Help.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The S3flat.drv video driver can be used on video cards manufactured with the S3
video 801, 805 or 928 chipset.
