Hardware Management and Maintenance
-----------------------------------

Planning for your Exchange Server system involves several issues. Among these
issues are server selection, disk configuration, and disk management and
maintenance.

Planning and Configuring Servers:

Because Exchange databases must be capable of fast access to large amounts of
information, server performance and reliability must be your primary concerns
when you select hardware for your databases. High-quality components minimize
the likelihood of data loss. Hardware that is too slow to support the load on
your server slows down your entire system.

Note that you should be skeptical of manufacturers' performance benchmarks.
Original equipment manufacturers typically use RAID 0 when they test. You should
use RAID 5 or RAID 1 for database partitions to ensure the greatest
reliability.

Use RAID controllers that have write caching with ECC memory protection and
battery backup.

Optimizing Database Access:

For servers that support large information stores--stores that are 50 to 100
gigabytes (GB) in size--it is especially important to follow these guidelines.

 - Place transaction log files and database files on separate disks.

 - Use a dedicated high-performance spindle for the transaction logs.

 - Use a dedicated partition for the databases. As servers get bigger, the
   database partition starts to experience much more input/output (I/O)
   activity. This is especially true for RAID 5 partitions because of the added
   overhead. As a result, it is a good idea to put only database files on the
   database partition.

 - Put the message transfer agent (MTA) database and tracking logs on the system
   disk (if you don't have a spare spindle), not on the database partition.

 - Use the NTFS file system instead of a file allocation table (FAT) system for
   all Exchange Server database partitions, including partitions that contain
   the information store databases and transaction log files.

The following sample disk configuration is recommended for typical large
servers:

 - Mirror set 1: System disk; includes binaries, the swap file, and the MTA
   database

 - Mirror set 2: Transaction files only, RAID 5 partition, Exchange information
   store, and directory databases only

Managing Disk Capacity:

When you are planning your Exchange Server system, one important issue is
determining how much disk space you need to allow for the information stores.
Unless you take a conscientious approach to capacity management, the size of
your information store databases can quickly get out of control.

Set a maximum information store size, and then manage the information store
within those limits. You can get a good idea of how big your databases will grow
by setting mailbox quotas and then tracking the growth of the information store
over time. Allow enough free space to support the messaging needs of the users
on the server, but set mailbox storage limits so that users do not consume
excessive amounts of disk resources.

Also, plan for how you would handle an oversize information store if that
situation arises, including contingency plans for reclaiming disk space or
adding extra disks to support your server's load. Allow enough space on the
system to let you run the Eseutil and Isinteg utilities if you need to. As a
general rule, plan to have approximately 25 to 30 percent extra disk space for
these utilities.

Defragmenting the Database:

One of the most important functions that the information store performs during
regular online maintenance is reclaiming unused disk space by defragmenting the
database.

This feature has been fine-tuned since Exchange 5.0. Exchange 5.5 Service Pack 1
includes a reporting tool that provides, in the event log, an estimate of how
much free space is available in the information store after online
defragmentation. This makes it much easier to estimate how much disk space is
needed.

The event log shows when online defragmentation starts, stops, resumes, and
finishes. When you back up the information store or perform an offline
defragmentation, check the event log to make sure you are not overlapping with
an online defragmentation. (However, note that if online defragmentation is
interrupted, the information store resumes the process as soon as possible.)

Online defragmentation does everything that you need it to do except shrink the
size of the database files on the disk. If you make major changes to the
Exchange Server computer (for example, if you move or delete a large number of
mailboxes or remove a large number of newsgroups), consider performing an
offline defragmentation by running the Eseutil utility with the /d option.

Generally, however, avoid offline defragmentation because it is an expensive
procedure. When offline defragmentation runs, it creates a new database file and
then copies all the data in the old file to the new file, which can take a long
time. On average, it takes about one hour to defragment 5 to 10 GB of disk
space. Also, you need enough free space for the offline defragmentation process
to hold the new file. As a general rule, you should have 100 percent more free
space than the amount you are defragmenting.

Backup Strategy
---------------

Design a backup strategy that consists of simple procedures that have as few
steps as possible so that you can easily perform those same steps whenever you
need to restore data on a server.

The recommended backup strategy for Exchange Server is to perform full online
backups every day. Performing a full backup only once a week and then performing
only differential backups the rest of the time has definite drawbacks. For
example, if your Exchange Server computer stops responding (crashes) sometime
before your scheduled full backup, and you cannot restore your latest
differential backup because of a problem with the backup tape, you must use the
full backup from the previous week, and you will almost certainly lose data.

Optimizing Backup and Restore Performance:

The real limiting factor when it comes to building large servers is, how fast can
you back up data, and more important, how fast can you restore it? To get the
best performance from the backup and restore process, use high-performance
backup software along with the fastest backup hardware you can get.

The following list identifies a few of the many vendors who provide
high-performance backup software that works with Exchange Server:

 - Cheyenne ARCserve

 - Legato NetWorker

 - Seagate BackupExec

Your backup hardware should consist of the following components:

 - Tape backup equipment that supports streaming and striping.

 - Fast-Wide SCSI bus communication. You should have seven or eight disks in an
   array if you are using more than one Digital Linear Tape (DLT) drive in
   parallel.

If you outfit your system with quality components, what kind of performance can
you expect? If the system is properly configured, you should be able to reach
the following speeds:

 - Backup to a single DLT 35/70 tape drive: Approximately 30 GB per hour (or 8.5
   MB per second) with hardware compression.

 - Backup to a RAID 5 array of four DLT 35/70 tape drives: Approximately 40 GB
   per hour.

 - Restore to RAID 5 disk partition: Approximately 20 to 25 GB per hour with
   write-back caching. If write-back caching is disabled, restoring takes twice
   as long.

Maintenance Routine:

Implement a maintenance routine that enhances the likelihood of successful data
recovery in the event of an emergency.

As part of this routine, store your backup tapes in a safe place. Clean the tape
drives regularly, as recommended by the tape drive manufacturer, and discard old
backup tapes according to the manufacturer's recommended cycles. Regularly test
your backup procedures and verify the quality of your backups to make sure that
you are backing up the system accurately.

Practice your backup and restore procedures regularly:

 - Use a full backup from your normal backup set to restore the database files
   to a test server, and then make sure that the log files replay the way you
   expect them to.

 - Restore any incremental or differential backups that are built from the full
   backup to make sure that they restore correctly.

 - Run some basic tests. For example, log on to a mailbox or access a public
   folder to make sure that the restored database is functioning properly.

It is useful to run the following test before you deploy Exchange Server in a
production environment:

1. Back up the Exchange Server databases to tape.

2. Generate load on the system so that the log files record some activity. You
   can do this by running the Loadsim or Mailstorm utility.

3. Simulate a crash.

4. Restore the database files from your tape backup, and then make sure that the
   log files replay as you expect them to.

5. Run some basic tests. For example, log on to a mailbox or access a public
   folder to make sure that the restored database is functioning properly.

Disaster Recovery
-----------------

If a system crash causes loss of data that is in memory or if software or
hardware failure causes corruption in the contents of a database, you may need
to recover data. Typically, you can repair damage from a system crash by
performing a "soft recovery" when you restart the server. Software or hardware
failure can require a restore from backup.

Soft Recovery:

A soft recovery is a process that runs automatically when you try to start the
information store after a system failure. Soft recovery uses the log files and
database files on the disk instead of using tape backup.

If your server crashes and the contents of memory are lost, the database file on
disk is flagged as inconsistent. Before you can restart the Exchange Server
computer, the database must be consistent. Exchange Server simulates a clean
shutdown by replaying pages from the log files on disk into the information
store databases. This process involves the following steps:

1. The database engine checks to see if the Edb.log file exists.

2. The database engine reads the Checkpoint file to determine which log file to
   start replaying.

3. At the end of the operation, the database is effectively consistent again and
   the information store can start normally.

Restoring from Online Backup:

If soft recovery does not work or if there is a more serious problem within the
system, you need to restore from backup.

The process for restoring from an online backup is similar to soft recovery.
Exchange Server makes sure that all of the files are put in the right place and
brings the database up to a consistent state. The following steps describe the
process:

1. When you restore data from tape backup, the restore process returns to disk
   all of the files that were backed up.

2. The system attendant starts the information store.

3. The information store checks the RestoreInProgress key in the registry and
   determines that the database has been restored from an online backup.

4. The RestoreInProgress key tells the information store where to start
   replaying the transaction logs. It does not check for the Edb.log.

5. The information store writes pages in the .pst file into the database files,
   replays the log files that are specified by the RestoreInProgress key, and
   plays through any other logs that are on disk.

6. If you need to restore a corrupted information store, a full recovery
   includes fixing the problem, restoring the database, and rolling forward all
   transaction log files

The most time-consuming aspect of doing a restore is not copying the database
files back to the disk but replaying the log files. Depending on how often you
perform full backups, it can take several hours to replay log files on large
servers during a restore. This is because the database engine must run through
every transaction that has occurred since the last backup.

Typically, replaying a transaction log file takes between 30 seconds and four
minutes. The replay speed varies according to the type of transactions that must
be replayed. For example, it takes the information store longer to replay log
files that have a lot of small delete operations or attachments. You can test
your log files to get a more accurate estimate of how long it takes to roll
forward the transaction log files on your system.

Restoring Individual Items in a Mailbox:

Sometimes users delete messages but later realize that they should not have
deleted them. Because Exchange Server handles backup and restore procedures at
the physical page layer, not at the mailbox level, you cannot easily restore
individual messages in a mailbox from backup. Some third-party backup programs
do allow you to do a "brick backup"; however, they do not use the Exchange
Server backup and restore application programming interfaces (APIs) and
typically do not perform as well as backups at the physical page layer do.

However, there is a way for users to recover messages that they have deleted from
a mailbox without having to resort to backups. The Recover Deleted Items feature
that comes with Exchange Server 5.5 lets a user retrieve messages from the
Deleted Items folder in Outlook if you enable the feature on the server. Note
that if you do enable the Recover Deleted Items feature, the server will require
additional disk resources to store the deleted items.

In a future release, Exchange Server will be extended to allow applications to
recover messages even after they have been permanently deleted from the system.

Managing and Maintaining Your Databases:

You may already know that the information store in Exchange Server 5.5 is
designed to run almost forever. For this reason, you rarely need to turn off
your server to perform regular maintenance.

Except for performing backups, Exchange Server automatically takes care of all
database maintenance while the server is online. Most of these activities occur
as background processes during regular information store maintenance. The
information store typically runs online maintenance at night and performs
important tasks such as Deleted Item cache processing, general cleanup, and
online defragmentation.

Key Messages
------------

These are the key messages that you should take away from this white paper:

 - Do online (or copy) backups regularly, preferably every night.

 - Monitor your backups, track the status of the database engine and the
   information store, and do not ignore error messages!

 - Decide how big you will allow your information store to grow, and manage it
   at that level.

 - Trust Exchange Server 5.5 to take care of internal database management,
   including database defragmentation.

 - Test and practice your backup and restore procedures.
