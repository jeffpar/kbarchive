SUMMARY
=======

What is the IExpress Deployment Kit?
----------------------------------------

The IExpress Deployment Kit (IDK) is a series of articles and utilities to
generate user-specific profiles as well as rollout hotfixes or patches by
bundling all files together into one custom package. This custom package
can be run as a stand-alone executable, or added to a login script, etc.

Why use the IDK?
----------------

Administrators deploying Outlook need to dynamically generate profiles and
update Outlook with the various patches and hotfixes available. By using
the articles and tools included, administrators can accomplish both of
these tasks during installation in one step.

How does the IDK work?
----------------------

Administrators accomplish multiple tasks in one step by bundling program
files into one self-extracting executable. The Windows INF technology is
then used to execute the program or patches along with any command-line
switches. This way applications can run in quiet mode or particular options 
can be specified. A sample .inf is supplied with the IDK. This gives
administrators more control over deployment; they are not tied to using
utilities running in the background where environment parameters can't be
easily changed. 

Can I only generate profiles?
-----------------------------

No. With this method you can apply QFE hotfixes, patches available with a
Service Pack, patches downloaded from the Web, replace .dll files, or
install full applications.

What is the Profile Designer?
------------------------------
Profile Designer is a graphical utility to help in the generation of the
custom package needed for a user specific profile. The utility can generate
a custom .prf file with specific services and Outlook settings. It can
generate an .inf file to be used as a building block for building a custom
package. It can create the whole self-extracting archive with the click of
a button. This will eliminate the need to completely understand .inf and 
.prf files if all you wish to do is make a custom profile package.

What's new in this version of Profile Designer v2.5?
----------------------------------------------------

- Profile Designer can now set the number of months and the
frequency to publish free/busy information.

- Includes Profgen 3.0. This allows the variable $USERNAME$ to be
used throughout the PRF file. Anywhere this variable appears it
will be replaced with the currently logged in user name. This can
be used for the mailbox name, as well as for file location for 
Personal Folders, Personal Address Books, AutoArchive Folders and 
Offline Folders.

- Interface changes which makes it easier to select the services 
and options to be included in the profile.

Does it only work with Outlook and the ODK?
-------------------------------------------

No. The IDK can be used to generate a self-extracting stand-alone
executable, which can accomplish the above tasks for almost any
application.

Your update could then be emailed to users, deployed through Systems
Management Server, used in logon scripts, and so on.
