1. MAKING YOUR SOFTWARE COMPATIBLE WITH MS-DOS 5.O
--------------------------------------------------

1.1 Above Board 286 and Above Board Plus Installation Programs:

CAUTION: The Intel Above Board installation program tests memory in a way that
corrupts extended memory.

Before using Intel's Above Board installation program, make sure you haven't
loaded software such as SMARTDrive or RAMDrive that uses extended memory.

*******************************************************************
*                                                                 *
*  1.2 Amload                                                     *
*  ----------                                                     *
*  If you can't use the Apricot Computer Amload program,          *
*  use the following LOADFIX command:                             *
*                                                                 *
*     LOADFIX amload.exe                                          *
*                                                                 *
*******************************************************************

For information about the LOADFIX command, see Chapter 4 of the "Microsoft MS-DOS
Getting Started" guide.

1.3 AUTORUN.EXE:

If you can't use Mountain Network Solutions AUTORUN.EXE, a tape-drive backup
program, contact your vendor for an upgrade.

1.4 CodeView:

CAUTION: Using versions 3.0 to 3.13 of the CodeView CV.EXE file may cause the
loss of data if your system has a 80386 memory manager (such as EMM386.EXE) and
device drivers or programs that use extended memory.

To start CodeView versions 3.0 to 3.13 safely, use the CV.COM file included with
MS-DOS 5.0.

Copy the CV.COM file from the distribution disks to the directory that contains
your CV.EXE file. Then, type the following to start CodeView:

   " CV " (without the quotation marks)

   or

   " CV.COM " (without the quotation marks)

If you start CodeView by using a batch file or program item in a shell (such as
MS-DOS Shell), change the batch file or program item so that it specifies the
CV.COM instead of the CV.EXE file.

Make sure you use HIMEM.SYS driver version 2.77 or later with CodeView.
Otherwise, the CV.COM file does not prevent data loss. MS-DOS 5.0 includes
version 2.77.

This problem has been fixed in CodeView version 3.14. Call Microsoft Sales
Information Center (MSIC) for information about this version; see your
registration card for the phone number.

1.5 Easel 6.0:

Interactive Images Easel 6.0 is incompatible with the DOS=HIGH and EMM386
commands. Contact your vendor for an update.

1.6 Fastback:

If you run MS-DOS 5.0 in the high memory area, you must use the LOADFIX command
before running Fifth Generation Systems Fastback or the Fastback installation
program. Type the following:

   " LOADFIX fb.exe " (without the quotation marks)

   or

   " LOADFIX fbinstal.exe " (without the quotation marks)

For information about the LOADFIX command, see Chapter 4 of the "Microsoft MS-DOS
Getting Started" guide.

1.7 GeoWorks:

If you cannot run GeoWorks (PC/GEOS) after installing MS-DOS 5.0, use the SETVER
command to report version number 4.01 to the GEOS.EXE file.

Do not run the installation program for GeoWorks Ensemble when MS-DOS Shell Task
Swapper is active.

Use the Exclusive Tasking option when running GeoWorks Ensemble with Windows, and
use the Prevent Program Switch option when running it with MS-DOS Shell Task
Swapper.

1.8 Keyboard Conflicts:

Some software packages do not support the extended ROM BIOS for 101/102-key
keyboards. These include Lotus Metro, Lotus Express, IBM Displaywrite III,
Borland Turbo Lightning, and Micro Logic Tornado 1.8. If you can't use your
keyboard after starting an application, restart your computer, and add the
following line to your CONFIG.SYS file:

   " switches=/k " (without the quotation marks)

If you are using ANSI.SYS, also add a /k switch to the DEVICE=ANSI.SYS command in
your CONFIG.SYS file.

**********************************************************************

*  1.9 LINK.EXE: Unexpected Error Messages                           *
*  ---------------------------------------                           *
*  If you get unexpected error messages while linking programs,      *
*  make sure you don't have an old version of LINK.EXE in your DOS   *
*  directory or path.                                                *
*                                                                    *
*  LINK.EXE is not supplied with MS-DOS 5.0.                         *
*                                                                    *
*                                                                    *
**********************************************************************

1.10 Lotus 1-2-3 (3.0 or Later):

If you run Lotus 1-2-3 3.0 with Task Swapper in MS-DOS Shell, set the XMS Memory
KB Required option in the Advanced dialog box to 384.

For more information about specifying advanced properties, see Chapter 8 of the
"Microsoft MS-DOS User's Guide and Reference."

If you run Lotus 1-2-3 3.0 or later and load device drivers or memory-resident
programs into the upper memory area, use the RAM switch with the
DEVICE=EMM386.EXE command in your CONFIG.SYS file.

1.11 Manifest:

Version 1.0 of Quarterdeck Manifest is incompatible with MS-DOS 5.0. Contact your
vendor for an upgrade.

1.12 Microsoft CD-ROM Extensions:

Use a MSCDEX.EXE version that is compatible with MS-DOS 4.0 or later.

1.13 Paintbrush 2.0:

If you have an EGA monitor and want to run Microsoft or ZSoft Paintbrush 2.0, you
must remove the DEVICE=EGA.SYS command from your CONFIG.SYS file. After removing
the command, you may have difficulty with screen swapping when using Task
Swapper in MS-DOS Shell.

1.14 PC-Kwik Disk Accelerator:

Do not load versions of Multisoft PC-Kwik Disk Accelerator earlier than 2.0 into
the upper memory area.

1.15 Pklite:

Do not use Pklite to pack device drivers.

If you have a PC-Kwik cache on your system, and you can't run a packed program,
do one of the following:

   * Use the LOADFIX command to start the program.
   * Run MS-DOS 5.0 in conventional memory.
   * Run a version of the program that was not packed with Pklite.
   * Disable asynchronous reads on the PC-Kwik cache.

For information about the LOADFIX command, see Chapter 4 of the "Microsoft MS-DOS
Getting Started" guide.

1.16 ProKey and MS-DOS Editor/QBasic:

Some versions of RoseSoft ProKey are incompatible with MS-DOS Editor and QBasic.

1.17 Sidekick 2.0:

If you are running MS-DOS 5.0 in the high memory area, use the following LOADFIX
command to start Borland Sidekick 2.0:

   " LOADFIX sk2.exe " (without the quotation marks)

For information about the LOADFIX command, see Chapter 4 of the "Microsoft MS-DOS
Getting Started" guide.

1.18 Soft-ICE:

When using Nu-Mega Soft-ICE, load it before loading other drivers. Otherwise, you
may lose data stored in extended memory by drivers such as SMARTDrive.

1.19 Software Carousel:

Software Carousel 5.0 is incompatible with MS-DOS 5.0.

If you installed HIMEMSLS.SYS, remove the DEVICE=HIMEMSLS.SYS command from your
CONFIG.SYS after running Setup.

To use DOSKEY, load it after loading Software Carousel into memory.

1.20 Task Swapper and Asynchronous I/O:

Some programs that perform asynchronous communications are incompatible with
MS-DOS Shell Task Swapper. Terminal-emulation software (such as SmartCom and
Procomm Plus) and server/client software (such as Laplink and Blast) are
asynchronous communications programs. If you can't use an asynchronous program,
contact your vendor for more information.

*   -----------------------                                          *
*   The Borland Turbo Debugger 386 is configuration-dependent and    *
*   must be reinstalled after you upgrade to MS-DOS 5.0.             *
*                                                                    *

1.22 Ventura Publisher:

If you can't start Ventura Publisher, make sure your Ventura Publisher directory
is within the first 70 characters of the PATH command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
file.

1.23 WordPerfect WPINFO.EXE 5.1:

Some versions of WordPerfect WPINFO.EXE are incompatible with MS-DOS 5.0. Contact
your vendor for more information.

1.24 WordPerfect Office 3.0:

Some versions of WordPerfect Office 3.0 are incompatible with MS-DOS 5.0. Contact
your vendor for more information.

1.25 XTreeNet:

To use XTreeNet with MS-DOS Shell Task Swapper, select the Prevent Program Switch
option in the MS-DOS Shell Advanced dialog box. For more information about
specifying advanced properties, see Chapter 8 of the "Microsoft MS-DOS User's
Guide and Reference."
