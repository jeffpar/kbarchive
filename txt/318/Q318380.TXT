-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When users try to access content on your Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0
or Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 server through HTTP or File Transfer
Protocol (FTP), IIS returns a numeric code that indicates the status of the
request. This status code is recorded in the IIS log, and it may also be
displayed in the Web browser or FTP client. The status code can indicate whether
a particular request is successful or unsuccessful and can also reveal the exact
reason why a request is unsuccessful.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Log File Locations:

By default, IIS places its log files in %WINDIR\System32\Logfiles. This directory
contains separate directories for each World Wide Web (WWW) and FTP site. By
default, logs are created in the directories daily and are named with the date
(for example, exYYMMDD.log). For additional information about setting up
logging, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q313437 HOW TO: Enable Logging in IIS 5.0

HTTP:

1xx - Informational

These status codes indicate a provisional response. The client should be prepared
to receive one or more 1xx responses before receiving a regular response.

 - 100 - Continue.

 - 101 - Switching Protocols.

2xx - Success

This class of status codes indicates that the server successfully accepted the
client request.

 - 200 - OK. The client request has succeeded.

 - 201 - Created.

 - 202 - Accepted.

 - 203 - Non-Authoritative Information.

 - 204 - No Content.

 - 205 - Reset Content.

 - 206 - Partial Content.

3xx - Redirection

The client browser must take more action to fulfill the request. For example, the
browser may have to request a different page on the server or repeat the request
by using a proxy server.

 - 300 - Multiple choices.

 - 301 - Moved Permanently.

 - 302 - Found.

 - 303 - See Other.

 - 304 - Not Modified.

 - 305 - Use Proxy.

 - 306 - This code is reserved but not used.

 - 307 - Temporary Redirect.

4xx - Client Error

An error occurs, and the client appears to be at fault. For example, the client
may request a page that does not exist, or the client may not provide valid
authentication information.

 - 400 - Bad Request.

 - 401 - Access denied.

IIS defines a number of different 401 errors that indicate a more specific cause
of the error. These specific error codes are displayed in the browser but are
not displayed in the IIS log:

    - 401.1 - Logon failed.

    - 401.2 - Logon failed due to server configuration.

    - 401.3 - Unauthorized due to ACL on resource.

    - 401.4 - Authorization failed by filter.

    - 401.5 - Authorization failed by ISAPI/CGI application.

 - 403 - Forbidden.

IIS defines a number of different 403 errors that indicate a more specific cause
of the error:

    - 403.1 - Execute access forbidden.

    - 403.2 - Read access forbidden.

    - 403.3 - Write access forbidden.

    - 403.4 - SSL required.

    - 403.5 - SSL 128 required.

    - 403.6 - IP address rejected.

    - 403.7 - Client certificate required.

    - 403.8 - Site access denied.

    - 403.9 - Too many users.

    - 403.10 - Invalid configuration.

    - 403.11 - Password change.

    - 403.12 - Mapper denied access.

    - 403.13 - Client certificate revoked.

    - 403.14 - Directory listing denied.

    - 403.15 - Client Access Licenses exceeded.

    - 403.16 - Client certificate untrusted or invalid.

    - 403.17 - Client certificate has expired or is not yet valid.

 - 404 - Not found.

 - 404.1 - Site not found.

 - 405 - Method not allowed.

 - 406 - Not acceptable.

 - 407 - Proxy authentication required.

 - 412 - Precondition failed.

 - 414 - Request-URI too long.

5xx - Server Error

The server cannot complete the request because it encounters an error.

 - 500 - Internal server error.

 - 500.12 - Application restarting.

 - 500.13 - Server too busy.

 - 500.15 - Requests for GLOBAL.ASA not allowed.

 - 500-100.ASP - ASP error (note that this code occurs with IIS 5.0 only).

 - 501 - Not implemented.

 - 502 - Bad gateway.

 - 503 - Service unavailable.

 - 504 - Gateway timeout.

 - 505 - HTTP version not supported.

Common HTTP Status Codes and Their Causes:

 - 200 - Success. This status code indicates that IIS has successfully processed
   the request.

 - 304 - Not Modified. The client requests a document that is already in its
   cache and the document has not been modified since it was cached. The client
   uses the cached copy of the document, instead of downloading it from the
   server.

 - 401.1 - Logon failed. The logon attempt is unsuccessful, probably because of
   a user name or password that is not valid.

 - 401.3 - Unauthorized due to ACL on resource. This indicates a problem with
   NTFS permissions. This error may occur even if the permissions are correct
   for the file that you are trying to access. For example, you see this error
   if the IUSR account does not have access to the C:\Winnt\System32\Inetsrv
   directory.

   Q187506 List of NTFS Permissions Required for IIS Site to Work

 - 403.1 - Execute access forbidden. The following are two common causes of this
   error message:

    - You do not have enough Execute permissions. For example, you may receive
      this error message if you try to access an ASP page in a directory where
      permissions are set to None, or you try to execute a Common Gateway
      Interface (CGI) script in a directory with Scripts Only permissions. To
      modify the Execute permissions, right-click the directory in the Microsoft
      Management Console (MMC), click Properties, click the Directory tab, and
      make sure that the Execute Permissions setting is appropriate for the
      content that you are trying to access.

    - The script mapping for the file type that you are trying to execute is not
      set up to recognize the verb that you are using (for example, GET or
      POST). To verify this, right-click the directory in the MMC, click
      Properties, click the Directory tab, click Configuration, and verify that
      the script mapping for the appropriate file type is set up to allow the
      verb that you are using.

 - 403.2 - Read access forbidden. Verify that you have set up IIS to allow Read
   access to the directory. Also, if you are using a default document, verify
   that the document exists.

number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q247677 Error Message: 403.2 Forbidden: Read Access Forbidden

 - 403.3 - Write access forbidden. Verify that the IIS permissions and the NTFS
   permissions are set up to grant Write access to the directory.

number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q248072 Error Message: 403.3 Forbidden: Write Access Forbidden

 - 403.4 - SSL required. Disable the Require secure channel option, or use HTTPS
   instead of HTTP to access the page.

If you receive this error for a Web site that does not have a certificate
installed, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q224389 Err Msg: HTTP Error 403, 403.4, 403.5 Forbidden: SSL Required

 - 403.5 - SSL 128 required. Disable the Require 128-bit encryption option, or
   use a browser that supports 128-bit encryption to view the page.

If you receive this error for a Web site that does not have a certificate
installed, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q224389 Err Msg: HTTP Error 403, 403.4, 403.5 Forbidden: SSL Required

 - 403.6 - IP address rejected. You have configured your server to deny access
   to your current IP address.

number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q248043 Error Message: 403.6 - Forbidden: IP Address Rejected

 - 403.7 - Client certificate required. You have configured your server to
   require a certificate for client authentication, but you do not have a valid
   client certificate installed.

the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q190004 Error 403.7 or 'Connection to Server Could Not Be Established'


 - 403.8 - Site access denied. You have set up a domain name restriction for the
   domain that you are using to access your server.

For additional information about how to resolve this problem, click the article
number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q248032 Error Message: Forbidden: Site Access Denied 403.8

 - 403.9 - Too many users. The number of users who are connected to the server
   exceeds the connection limit that you have set. For additional information
   about how to change this limit, click the article number below to view the
   article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q248074 Error Message: Access Forbidden: Too Many Users Are Connected 403.9

   NOTE: Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional and Microsoft Windows XP
   Professional automatically impose a 10-connection limit on IIS. You cannot
   change this limit.

 - 403.12 - Mapper denied access. The page that you want to access requires a
   client certificate, but the user ID that is mapped to your client certificate
   has been denied access to the file.

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

   Q248075 Error: HTTP 403.12 - Access Forbidden: Mapper Denied Access

 - 404 - Not found. This error may occur if the file that you are trying to
   access has been moved or deleted. It can also occur if you try to access a
   file that has a restricted file name extension after you install the URLScan
   tool. In this case, you see "Rejected by URLScan" in the log file entry for
   that request.

 - 500 - Internal server error. You see this error message for a wide variety of
   server-side errors. Your event viewer logs may contain more information about
   why this error occurs. Additionally, you can disable friendly HTTP error
   messages to receive a detailed description of the error.

   Messages' Feature on the Server Side

 - 500.12 - Application restarting. This indicates that you tried to load an ASP
   page while IIS was in the process of restarting the application. This message
   should disappear when you refresh the page. If you refresh the page and the
   message appears again, it may be caused by antivirus software that is
   scanning your Global.asa file.

   Q248013 Err Msg: HTTP Error 500-12 Application Restarting

 - 500-100.ASP - ASP error. You receive this error message when you try to load
   an ASP page that has errors in the code. To obtain more specific information
   about the error, disable friendly HTTP error messages. By default, this error
   is only enabled on the default Web site.

 - 553 Requested action not taken. File name not allowed.

Common FTP Status Codes and Their Causes:

 - 150 - FTP uses two ports: 21 for sending commands, and 20 for sending data. A
   status code of 150 indicates that the server is about to open a new
   connection on port 20 to send some data.

 - 226 - The command opens a data connection on port 20 to perform an action,
   such as transferring a file. This action successfully completes, and the data
   connection is closed.

 - 230 - This status code appears after the client sends the correct password.
   It indicates that the user has successfully logged on.

 - 331 - You see this status code after the client sends a user name. This same
   status code appears regardless of whether the user name that is provided is a
   valid account on the system.

 - 426 - The command opens a data connection to perform an action, but that
   action is canceled, and the data connection is closed.

 - 530 - This status code indicates that the user cannot log on because the user
   name and password combination is not valid. If you use a user account to log
   on, you may have mistyped the user name or password, or you may have chosen
   to allow only Anonymous access. If you log on with the Anonymous account, you
   may have configured IIS to deny Anonymous access.

 - 550 - The command is not executed because the specified file is not
   available. For example, this status code occurs when you try to GET a file
   that does not exist, or when you try to PUT a file in a directory for which
   you do not have Write access.
