SUMMARY
=======

Visual Basic developers can call Windows DLLs provided that Basic function
declarations for the functions in the DLL are included in the Visual Basic
project. When calling ODBC drivers from Visual Basic, there are a few
considerations to keep in mind.

This article discusses issues surrounding the use of the SQLBindCol ODBC function
from Visual Basic.

The SQLBindCol function is used to bind a variable to a column of a result set.
The function binds an address in memory to a column of data and subsequent calls
to SQLFetch place the data for that column and row into the specified memory
location.

It is possible to pass the address of a Visual Basic string to SQLBindCol but as
strings may be moved in memory by VB, it is not safe to use SQLBindCol without
first locking the memory. This article discusses using VB strings with
SQLBindCol and calling the Windows API functions GlobalAlloc, GlobalLock, and
hmemcpy to allocate, lock, and retrieve data from memory into Visual Basic
strings.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After submitting a SQL query, an ODBC application binds the results of that
query into variables. Typically one variable is associated with each column in
the results set. The following is the SQLBindCol declaration that must be used
by a Visual Basic program:

   ' function must be declared on one line!<BR/>
      Declare Function SQLBindCol Lib "odbc.dll" Alias "SqlBindCol"<BR/>
      (ByVal hstmt As Long, ByVal icol As Integer, ByVal fCType As Integer,
      rgbValue As Any , ByVal cbValueMax As Long, pcbValue As Long)<BR/>
      As Integer

Essentially, a pointer to memory is passed to SQLBindCol. The ODBC driver then
places data in that memory location specified by the pointer on each fetch. The
application can then retrieve the data in the recordset by referencing that
memory location.

To pass a pointer to a string from Visual Basic to a DLL, you use the ByVal
keyword. This topic will not be discussed in this article; the following
Knowledge Base article discusses passing strings from VB to DLLs:

   Q118643 How to Pass a String or String Arrays Between VB and a C DLL.

When you pass a string using ByVal to SQLBindCol (or any DLL) VB passes a pointer
to the string. It is possible to use VB strings with SQLBindCol as long as you
are not growing any other strings (including the text of controls) during the
time that the strings are bound. During normal processing, VB will periodically
reorganize its string space. This means that strings will be moved in memory and
their address will change. As a result, the address you passed to SQLBindCol is
no longer valid and you will see invalid data in your strings.

NOTE: This is behavior is by design for Visual Basic and is documented in the
Control Development Kit. Microsoft does not recommend using SQLBindCol with
Visual Basic strings and cannot guarantee that strings will not be moved in
memory. Using SQLBindCol with VB strings will result not only in incorrect data
but also General Protection Faults.

Calling SQLBindCol with VB Strings
----------------------------------

If you choose to use VB strings with SQLBindCol the following are some of the
rules that you must follow for SQLBindCol in your Basic code:

1. Do not manipulate any other strings between the call(s) to SQLBindCol and
   SQLFreeStmt with SQL_UNBIND. A common example is during a SQLFetch loop
   concatenating the bound variables into one long string and adding it to a
   text box.

2. When binding to strings, bind to variable-length Visual Basic strings, not
   fixed-length strings.

   Variable-length strings are declared thus: Dim mystr as String

3. Do not bind to arrays of strings. Arrays of strings are stored in 64K
   segments and Visual Basic may move string elements in memory to recover
   fragmented string space. As a result, the array element that a column is
   bound to may not be valid during a subsequent SQLFetch.

   As SQLExtendedFetch specifically requires binding to arrays, it is recommended
   that you do not use SQLExtendedFetch from Visual Basic.

4. Before binding variable-length strings, initialize them as the following,

   mystr = String$(255,0).

   This allocates a string.

5. When calling SQLBindCol and binding to a string (i.e., if rgbValue is going
   to be a string), use the Byval keyword. For instance,

   SQLBindCol(hstmt&, 1, SQL_C_CHAR, Byval mystr, cbMax&,  cbVal&)

Allocating Global Memory
------------------------

It is possible to use the Windows API function GlobalAlloc, GlobalLock, and
hmemcpy to obtain a fixed chunk of memory, bind columns with SQLBindCol to this
memory, and copy the data from the memory into a Visual Basic string.

   GlobalAlloc: allocates a block of memory and returns a handle to that
                memory if successful. You can allocate a chunk of
                memory for each column you wish to bind.

   GlobalLock:  locks the memory allocated with GlobalAlloc and returns a
                pointer to the memory. You can use GlobalLock to obtain a
                pointer which you can use with SQLBindCol.

   hmemcpy:     copies memory from one address to another a specified
                number of bytes. You can use hmemcpy to copy the bound
                memory to a variable length string.

NOTE: When finished with the memory you must call GlobalUnlock and GlobalFree to
free the memory and the selector used by GlobalAlloc. If you are performing a
large number of GlobalAlloc calls you should allocate fewer but larger chunks of
memory and break them apart manually.

The following demonstration assumes that you have a database table created and
populated called Customer. It also assumes that you have a data source already
created. The structure of the Customer table is:

   Field     Type         Null?
   --------- ------------ --------
   CustNum   int          not null
   Company   varchar(30)  null
   Address   varchar(30)  null
   City      varchar(30)  null

1. Start Visual Basic, or if VB is already running, create a new project. Form1
   is created by default.

2. Add two command buttons (Command1, Command2) to Form1. Add a text box (Text1)
   to Form1.

3. Set the following properties of the controls. Text1 properties must be see at
   design time:

   Command1.Caption = "Log On" Command2.Caption = "Execute Query"

   Text1.MultiLine = True Text1.ScrollBars = 3

4. Add the following to the <general> <declarations> section of
   Form1. (All Declare statements must be on 1 line.):

   End Sub

7. Save the project and run.

Additional Considerations
-------------------------

1. Use cbcoldef appropriately. Refer to Appendix D of the "Programmer s
   Reference" for the ODBC SDK.

2. Use a LONG variable for pcbValue, and not a literal value. Remember that you
   are passing by reference.
