Microsoft Windows 95
If you did a Custom installation of Windows 95 be sure you installed
the following components: Paint, WordPad, Media Player, Desktop
Wallpaper.

Microsoft Plus!
If you have installed Microsoft Plus! some of the custom icons and mouse
pointers used in the Desktop Themes may not match some of the examples
shown in Microsoft Windows 95 Starts Here which uses the standard icons
and mouse pointers of Windows 95.

Microsoft Access 2.0
Don't run Microsoft Access 2.0 while taking the course. If you run
Microsoft Windows 95 Starts Here while Microsoft Access is running,
you may notice that the mouse moves sluggishly during demonstrations.
You may also notice a change in the display if your computer is set to
256 colors.

Microsoft WordPad
If WordPad is on your Start Menu or in the StartUp folder before you
start the course, Microsoft Windows 95 Starts Here will remove it if you
go through "Customizing the Start Menu" in Unit 3 of the course.

supposed to be selecting text inside the window, you may not be able
to complete the topic. If this happens, click the Contents button to
return to the Contents screen, then press the GO BACK button.
