SUMMARY
=======

Printing PostScript from Windows NT to an AppleShare IP 6.0 secure print queue
may fail if Enable Security is turned on for that queue by using the AppleShare
IP Print Admin.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT does not pass user information to a PostScript device automatically.
A separator page has to be created to provide this functionality. When an
AppleShare IP Print Admin checks the Enable Security option for an AppleShare IP
6.x print queue, the Windows NT client must use a separator page to pass the
user name.

Follow these steps to create a separator page for Windows NT clients to print to
the AppleShare Print Queue. Please check with your AppleShare IP Print
administrator to verify that "Require Password for Printing" is off and "Enable
Security" is on, and then follow the steps below. Otherwise, go to the note
section below.

1. On the Windows NT computer, open a text editor such as Notepad.

2. Insert the following text without the space above and below into Notepad.

         @
         @L%!PS
         @L%%For: (@N@L)

   NOTE: Press ENTER after typing the last line of text.

3. Save the Notepad file to the %Windir%\System32 directory with an .sep
   extension (for example, psname.sep).

4. Apply the separator page to a particular printer.

5. Go to Start menu and choose Settings and select Printers.

6. Select the PostScript printer name that points to the AppleShare IP print
   queue; right-click and choose Properties.

7. Select the Separator Page button and choose Browse to locate the Psname.sep
   file located in %Windir%\System32.

8. Select OK to close the Browse dialog box.

9. Select OK to close the Separator Page dialog box.

10 Select OK to close the Printer Properties dialog box.

NOTE: This does not handle the issue of embedded PJL commands. Make sure the
printer has a PS error handler installed so you can catch any PostScript errors
that may occur. Also note that if "Require Password for Printing" is selected on
the AppleShare server, there is no mechanism for the AppleShare IP print queue
to accept a password by using this functionality; this functionality does not
exist because of password encryption issues and security.

please contact your local Apple dealer. This article only applies to PostScript
printing. For additional information about separator pages in Windows NT, please
