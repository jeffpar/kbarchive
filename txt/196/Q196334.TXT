======================================================================

The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When installing hotfixes on a server running Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal
Server Edition, it is important to confirm that the hotfix has been built to run
on Terminal Server. Hotfixes that are built to run on Windows NT Server 4.0,
Terminal Server Edition will have the 0x8000 bit set in the last two bytes of
the FileVer property of the VS_FIXEDFILEINFO structure. You can use the
Filever.exe utility to examine this structure.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you use the FILEVER utility on Apimon.exe from the Support directory of the
Windows NT Terminal Server Edition CDROM, you will see the following
information:

   filever /v apimon.exe

        VS_FIXEDFILEINFO:
        Signature:      feef04bd
        Struc Ver:      00010000
        FileVer:        00040000:05658004 (4.0:1381.32772)
        ProdVer:        00040000:05658004 (4.0:1381.32772)

        SubType:        00000000
        FileDate:       00000000:00000000

Note that the FileVer property shows a version number of 00040000:05658004 (in
hex) and 4.0:1381.32772 (in decimal). In this example, the last two bytes are
0x8004. Because the 0x8000 bit is set, this file was built for Terminal Server.
Therefore, any number greater than 32767 in last position of the dotted decimal
version number will be compatible.

The Filever.exe utility can be found in the Windows NT Server 4.0 Resource Kit
Supplement Two (or later). For more information, see the resource kit
documentation and the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
