-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the requirements and steps needed to install the
Microsoft OV/VM Connector, (formerly the LinkAge Exchange-OV/VM Connector).

This is a summary of information in the LinkAge Message Exchange manual,
Exchange-OfficeVision/VM Connector Configuration Guide, Version 3, Release 2,
located on the LinkAge software CD.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT Server Hardware Requirements for the OV/VM Connector
---------------------------------------------------------------

LinkAge recommends that the connector be installed on an Exchange Connector
server separate from the Exchange Server user mailbox computer. If Exchange
Server and the LinkAge connectors are on the same computer running Windows NT
Server, a minimum of 64 MB of RAM is required with an additional 16 MB for each
additional type of LinkAge connector (Lotus Notes, SNADS, and cc:Mail). The hard
disk drive must be sized according to customer-specific Exchange Server
requirements, with an additional 1 GB for the LinkAge server components,
software, and data files.

Windows NT Server Software Requirements for the OV/VM Connector
---------------------------------------------------------------

 - The version of Windows NT Server must be 3.51 Service Pack 4, 4.0 Service
   Pack 2, or later.

 - The version of Exchange Server must be 4.0 Service Pack 3, 5.0, or later.

 - The version of SNA Server must be 2.11 Service Pack 2, 3.0, or later.

 - The version of SQL Server must be 6.5 with SP2 or later, if you are using
   Linkage Directory Exchange (LDE).

LinkAge Administration Program Requirements
-------------------------------------------

The LinkAge Administration program can run on Windows 95, Windows NT Workstation,
and Windows NT Server. The Windows NT Server or Workstation account under which
the LinkAge Administrator runs must have rights to stop and start services on
the server running the Linkage Message Exchange (LME) Gateway (that is, it must
be a member of the Admin group on the local machine).

Full access to the Linkage share created during the Setup process.

A minimum of Admin privileges to the Exchange Server Organization, Site, and
Configuration containers.

OV/VM Software Requirements
---------------------------

 - IBM PROFS Version 2, Release 2, Modification Level 3, or IBM OfficeVision/VM
   Release 2, Modification Level 0.

 - RSCS Version 2.3.0 or 3.1.0 at PUT level 9202 or later.

 - ACF/VTAM Version 3 for VM/SP or higher.

 - SDLC, Ethernet, or Token Ring link to a properly configured SNA front- end
   processor running a version of ACF/VTAM that is compatible with ACF/VTAM
   version 3. You also have the option of connecting the Token Ring to an
   appropriately configured 3174.

Installation of the OV/VM Connector
-----------------------------------

There are two phases to installing the OV/VM Connector software. Phase One runs
Setup from a CD-ROM or floppy disk to copy files to the Exchange Server computer
where the connector will be installed. Phase Two runs the Setup program from the
LinkAge Software V3.2 program group (the Setup.exe program copied to the server
is different than the Setup.exe program on the CD) and configures the software
on the server.

Phase One:

   Run Setup in the Products directory, then apply the patch. The default is to
   install the LME component in a directory called Linkage at the root of the
   drive and not in the Exchsrvr directory.

   The Phase One Setup program creates a Linkage directory with 4 subdirectories
   and 62 files. The subdirectories are a Log directory no files, the MSGS
   directory with 4 files, an ODBC directory with 26 files, and the Setup
   directory with 12 files.

   NOTE: There is a patch folder included with your installation CD or floppy
   disk. You must apply the patch files after completing the first phase of
   Setup. To apply the patches after installing the LinkAge software, refer to
   the instructions located in the file provided with the patch disk or folder
   called Patches.txt. Linkage has provided a Patch.bat program that will do
   this function.

Phase Two:

 - Installation of the PROFS Connector

   1. Double-click the Setup icon in the LinkAge Software folder.

   2. Read the message on the Welcome screen, and click Next. The Select
      Installation Option window appears.

   3. Click the Configure Connector option, and then click Next. The Select
      Connector to Configure window appears.

   4. Click the Exchange-OV/VM Connector option, then click Next. The Configure
      LinkAge Connector window appears.

   5. Update the names of the Server, Organization, and Site containers of the
      Microsoft Exchange Server computer to which the Linkage Exchange- OV/VM
      Connector will connect. (Note that you can have downstream Exchange Server
      computers that will connect to OV/VM through this Exchange Server
      computer. Only the server to which the LinkAge Connector is directly
      connected needs to be identified to the Connector.)

   6. Click Next. The Setup program validates the information you entered and
      ensures that Microsoft Exchange Server is running. Then the Connector Node
      ID window appears.

   7. Enter the Connector's Node ID, used to generate OV/VM proxy addresses for
      Exchange Server users. Consult the host administrator to learn the node ID
      assigned to Exchange Server. (If you are using only the Conversation
      Monitor System (CMS), then you can use the Network Job Entry (NJE) link ID
      as the OV/VM node ID.) You are also asked whether you want the Setup
      process to automatically generate OV/VM proxy addresses for Exchange
      Server users. If you want proxy addresses to be created automatically
      according to the default proxy address format, answer 'Yes' to this
      prompt. If you want to assign proxy addresses annually, specify 'No.' See
      "Updating the Exchange and OV/VM Directories Manually" on page 175 of the
      manual for additional details.

   8. Click Next. The Setup program copies a number of files to the Exchange
      Server computer, updates the LinkAge configuration file (Linkage.ini), and
      installs the following on the Exchange Server computer you specified in
      Step 5:

      Addressing Template

   An extension that allows an individual OV/VM user to be added to the
   recipient list of an Exchange Server message.

      Proxy Address Generator

   An extension that allows the generation of OV/VM proxy addresses for Exchange
   Server users.

      OV/VM Connector Property Page

   A property page that allow you to configure the Exchange-OV/VM Connector.

      Queue Viewer

   An extension that provides a view of Exchange Server queues used by the
   LinkAge Connector.

Configuring Connector-Specific Settings in Exchange Server
----------------------------------------------------------

Use the Exchange Server Administrator program to configure settings on the
Exchange-OV/VM Connector property page using the instructions below:

1. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, click the Organization
   container, click Site, and click Connections.

2. Double-click the LinkAge Exchange-OV/VM Connector object The LinkAge
   Exchange-OV/VM Connector Properties page appears.

3. Click the Options tab and the Options property page appears. Update the
   fields on the page, referring to the on-line help for field descriptions. You
   can also click on the Message Tracking tab at this time to set message
   tracking options. Click OK when you have completed the page.

4. Select the Configuration container in the left pane of the window, then
   double-click on the Site Addressing Options object in the right pane. Select
   the Routing tab and verify that the entry for the OV/VM Connector appears in
   the list. If the entry does not appear, click the Recalculate Routing button
   to refresh the contents of the list. The entry for the connector must appear
   on the list for mail to be sent from Exchange Server to OV/VM.

Editing the Connector's OV/VM Directory File
--------------------------------------------

The LinkAge Connector uses node information for each OV/VM, CMS, and Exchange
Server system to which the Connector is connected. This node information is
defined in a file called Ovdfile.dat in the Linkage\Tables directory. It
contains the VM node ID, OV/VM mailman ID (also known as the Distribution
Manager ID), and location code of the OV/VM, CMS, and Exchange Server systems.
The format of the file is as follows where each of the tokens is separated by
one or more blanks. The following sample file is shipped with the LinkAge
Connector:

   OVCMNODE MAILMAN LOC (example of an entry for an OV/VM system)

   CMSNODE CMS CMS (example of an entry for an CMS system)
   EXCHNODE LOCAL LME (example of an entry for an exchange system)

Create a new entry for each OV/VM, Exchange Server, and CMS system to which the
Connector sends and from which the Connector receives mail, following the
guidelines below:

 - Identifying OV/VM Systems in the Directory File

   The values for the node ID and the location code must match those specified in
   columns 1-8 and 17-19, respectively, for the REMLOC definition for other
   PROFS or OV/VM systems on your network. (Refer to Table 2-12 on page 26 of
   the manual for further information.). The value used for the mailman ID (also
   known as the Distribution Manager ID) should match the one used on the OV/VM
   system.

 - Identifying CMS Systems in the Directory File

   For those VM systems that do not use PROFS or OV/VM, the value for the node ID
   should be the VM node ID of the CMS system. Use the keyword, CMS, for both
   the mailman ID and for the location code of each CMS node.

 - Identifying Exchange Server Systems in the Directory File

   The node ID and the location code of this line should identify your Exchange
   Server node ID and location ID respectively. Consult the Host Administrator
   for the node ID assigned to Exchange Server. Use the keyword, LOCAL, for the
   mailman ID. In addition, all downstream Exchange Server sites (if they have
   different node IDs in their PROFS proxy site addressing rule) should also be
   registered in the Directory file. The LinkAge Exchange-OV/VM Connector is now
   configured.

Starting the Connector
----------------------

The Exchange-OV/VM Connector is registered as a Windows NT Server service during
installation. To start the Connector, you simply start the service.

1. On the Windows desktop, click Start, point to Settings, and then click
   Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Services icon. The Services window will open.

3. Highlight the LinkAge Exchange-OV/VM Connector service and click Start.

4. Click Close to close the Services window.

You can also configure the Connector service to start automatically whenever the
server is booted.

1. On the Windows desktop, click Start, Settings, Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Services icon. The Services window will open.

3. Highlight the LinkAge Exchange-OV/VM Connector service and click Startup. Set
   Startup Type to Automatic and click OK.
