SUMMARY
=======

C2 refers to a set of security policies that define how a secure system
operates. The C2 evaluation process is separate from the C2 certification
process. As of August 1995, National Security Agency (NSA) granted the C2
security rating for Windows NT Server and Workstation version 3.5. As a result
these operating systems are on the Evaluated Products List (EPL).

Windows NT Server and Workstation version 3.51 has been granted the security
rating of E3/F-C2 though a similar evaluation process in the UK.

For security evaluation for Windows 2000 and beyond, see the following Microsoft
Web site:

NOTE: This does not mean that Windows NT is C2 certified (no operating system is
ever C2 certified). Certification applies to a particular installation,
including hardware, software, and the environment that the system is in. It is
up to an individual site to become C2 certified.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The requirements for A-, B-, C-, and D-level secure products are outlined in the
Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria (TCSEC) published by the National
Computer Security Center (NCSC). This publication is referred to as the "Orange
Book," and is part of NSA's security "rainbow series." Security level
requirements are open to interpretations that change over time. When undergoing
evaluation, each vendor negotiates with the NSA about whether or not the details
of its particular system implementation conform with the abstract security
policy concepts in the NSA's books. The vendor must provide evidence that the
requirements are being met.

Microsoft has opted not to include certain components of Windows NT in the
evaluation process, not because they would not pass the evaluation, but to save
time by reducing the load on the NSA. Additionally, the MS-DOS/Windows on
Windows (WOW) system may be treated as a Win32 application and would therefore
not need to be evaluated as part of the Trusted Computer Base (TCB). Networking
on NT may not have to go through the "Red Book," or "Trusted Network
Interpretation." It may be enough to consider networking to be another
subsystem, and therefore only the Orange Book would apply. New or modified
components and other hardware platforms can go through a "RAMP" process to be
included in the evaluation at a later time.

C2 Overview
-----------

The security policy in C2 is known as Discretionary Access Control (DAC). In the
Windows NT implementation, the basic idea is that users of the system:

 - Own objects

 - Have control over the protection of the objects they own

 - Are accountable for all their access-related actions

C2 classification does not define a substantive security system in the sense of
classified or unclassified data. (B-level security assumes the existence of an
independent security classification system and enforces that system, but does
not specify the substance of the classification system.)

For example, in Windows NT, every object (file, Clipboard, window, and so on) has
an owner; any owner can give or not give other users access to its objects. The
system tracks (audits) your actions for the administrators (that is, the system
administrator can track the objects you accessed, both successes and failures).

The key distinction between C-level and B-level security is in the notion of
access control. In a C2 (DAC) system, owners have absolute discretion about
whether or not others have access to their objects. In a B-level, or Mandatory
Access Control (MAC) system, objects have a security level defined independently
from the owner's discretion. For example, if you receive a copy of an object
marketed "secret," you can't give permission to other users to see this object
unless they have "secret" clearance. This is defined by the system independent
of your discretion. MAC involves the concept of "data labeling," which is the
creation and maintenance by the system of security "labels" on data objects,
unalterable by users (except in certain cases under system control and
auditing). An administrator can get access to anyone's objects, although it may
require some programming to do so (that is, the user interface won't expose this
power).

You can obtain more information on this process, including frequently asked
questions, a copy of the evaluated products list, and copies of TCSEC and other
documentation at the NCSC's web site at http://www.radium.ncsc.mil.
