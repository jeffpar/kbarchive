Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

MSN is Busy or Too Slow. Why Is This?

The dramatic rise in Internet usage has placed more demands on the telephone
lines, which are used to log on to the Internet. At MSN our goal is to create
the best online experience for our members. In an effort to meet the rising
demand for Internet access, we are always adding new MSN Internet Access
numbers, which you can find on the Access Number Update. In addition, we?re
working on bringing new access technology like ADSL to our membership.
If you are currently experiencing difficulties establishing a connection using
MSN Internet Access, it is possible that you are using an access phone number
which has an unusually high volume of callers or you are dialing during peak
hours. For best connection results, MSN suggests the following:

 - Try changing your Internet access phone number. You might find a number that
   isn't experiencing as much volume as the one you are currently using.

 - Try connecting to the Internet during off-peak hours. General peak hours for
   Internet usage range between 7:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m., local time.

Is There a Less Expensive Plan Than My Current One?

The best plan for you will depend on how much you use the Internet. For most
members, the $19.95 Premier Unlimited Plan offers the best value. You get
unlimited access to the Internet and e-mail.

To find out which alternate price plans are available to you as an MSN member, go
to the member accounts page and click the Change Plan option to see which plan
you currently have as well as the other options available or call (800)
386-5550.
