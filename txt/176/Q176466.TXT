SUMMARY
=======

In troubleshooting communication between computers running Exchange Server and
between computers running Exchange Server and Exchange Client, you often face
the issue of the use of packet filtering (firewall), which can result in an
inability to communicate. In certain situations, you may need to monitor traffic
on your network before introducing Exchange in your network infrastructure, to
ensure that communication can occur among the various Exchange components. This
article addresses the frequently asked questions of what ports need to be open
when firewalls are used and what ports need to be monitored in the Microsoft
Exchange organization.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In discussing network traffic associated with Exchange, there are six
scenarios:

1. Communication between POP3 clients and Exchange Server computers. Two
   conditions exist:

    - Downloading and retrieving messages

    - Sending messages

2. Communication between IMAP4 clients and Exchange Server computers. Two
   conditions exist:

    - Downloading and retrieving messages

    - Sending messages

3. Communication between Exchange Server computers and LDAP (Lightweight
   Directory Access Protocol) clients.

4. Communication between Exchange Client computers and Exchange Server
   computers.

5. Communication between two Exchange Server computers in the same site
   (intrasite communication).

6. Communication between two Exchange Server computers in different sites
   (intersite communication). This communication has two further distinctions:

    - Intersite link uses site connector (RPC).

    - Intersite link is an X.400 connector.

NOTE: The terms "same site" and "different site" are used here in an Exchange
infrastructure design context and do not have any bearing on location.
Consequently, two Exchange Server computers in the same site could be located in
two different places connected via a WAN link with routers and firewalls in
between.

TERMINOLOGY: When discussing ports, two terms are often used: "well-known" and
"ephemeral." "Well-known" represents ports below the 1024 range that are used
regularly and have in most cases a standardized assignment for certain types of
network service. "Ephemeral" represents all ports inclusive of and above the
1024 range.

An in-depth discussion follows of issues for each of the six scenarios presented
above.

Communication between POP3 clients and Exchange Server computers
----------------------------------------------------------------

Exchange 5.0 supports POP3, a protocol used to retrieve messages from a mail
server. In addition to POP3 mail clients like Internet Mail and News, Windows CE
Inbox, and Internet Mail Service for Windows, clients such as Pegasus and Eudora
Pro are often used to send and retrieve messages from the Exchange Server
computer. This introduces a new angle to the discussion of the availability of
TCP port access.

- Downloading and retrieving messages:

POP3 client access to messages on an Exchange Server computer is regulated by the
authentication method used. There are three such authentication methods. If
Basic or Windows NT Challenge/Response authentication (Windows NTLM
authentication) is used, downloading and retrieval of messages using a POP3
client requires access to TCP port 110. Exchange Server listens on port 110 for
any incoming connection requests from POP3 clients for message download. If the
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) authentication method is used, the Exchange Server
computer listens on port 995. Therefore, if you are designing the packet
filtering requirements of a network that includes an Exchange installation, keep
in mind the access to either TCP port 110 or TCP port 995 if POP3 is a supported
protocol.

- Sending messages:

When POP3 clients send messages, the Exchange Server computer is communicating
with an SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) host. This requires access to TCP
port 25. The Internet Mail Connector and the Internet Mail Service use TCP port
25 for inbound SMTP messages as defined by RFC-821. For inbound SMTP messages,
the Internet Mail Connector and Internet Mail Service monitor port 25 for
incoming connections from other SMTP hosts. Microsoft Exchange Server supports
POP3 as defined in the RFC- 1734 and RFC- 1957 specifications.

Communication between IMAP4 clients and Exchange Server computers
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Exchange version 5.5 supports IMAP4, the Internet Message Access Protocol. IMAP4
is a superset of POP3 and therefore supports all its features and some
additional ones. An example of an IMAP4 enhancement over POP3 is the ability to
search messages for key words while the messages are still on the mail server.
Users can then choose which messages to download to their local computer. IMAP4
also allows access to public folders and personal folders.

- Downloading and retrieving messages:

The ports that IMAP4 clients use when accessing messages on an Exchange Server
computer depend on the authentication method in use. With Basic or NTLM
authentication and TCP, the IMAP4 server listens on TCP port 143 for any
incoming connection requests from IMAP4 clients for message download and
retrieval. If SSL authentication is used, however, the port on which the
Exchange Server computer listens is TCP port 993. Router and firewall setups
should therefore take into consideration the access to TCP port 143 or TCP port
993 when this protocol is a supported feature for messaging.

- Sending messages:

As discussed above for POP3 clients sending messages, when IMAP4 clients send
messages, the Exchange Server computer is communicating with an SMTP host. This
requires access to TCP port 25. The Internet Mail Connector and Internet Mail
Service use TCP port 25 for inbound SMTP messages as defined by RFC-821. For
inbound SMTP messages, the Internet Mail Connector and Internet Mail Service
monitor port 25 for incoming connections from other SMTP hosts. Microsoft
Exchange Server supports IMAP4 as defined in the RFC-2060 and RFC- 2061.

Communication between Exchange Server computers and LDAP clients
----------------------------------------------------------------

LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a specification for client access
to the Exchange Server directory service to provide address book functionality.
It allows the client to connect to the directory and allows information
retrieval, addition, and modification. LDAP was introduced in Exchange version
5.0.

For the LDAP client to connect to the Exchange Server computer, the ports that
need to be configured on the firewall are based purely on the authentication
method in use. With Basic authentication, the Exchange Server computer listens
on port 389. For SSL authentication, the port that the Exchange Server computer
listens on is 636. Microsoft Exchange Server supports LDAP as defined in
RFC-1777.

Communication between Exchange Server computers and NNTP clients
----------------------------------------------------------------

The Network News Transport Protocol (NNTP) is widely used to post, distribute,
and retrieve USENET messages. Clients can access these newsgroups as Exchange
public folders. NNTP clients need to connect to the Exchange Server computer via
port 119. The proxy software or firewall should take this into consideration
when NNTP is supported. Microsoft Exchange Server supports NNTP as defined in
RFC-977.

Communication between Exchange Client computers and Exchange Server3 computers
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An Exchange Client computer on a LAN or WAN link uses remote procedure call (RPC)
to communicate with an Exchange Server computer. The Exchange Server computer,
an RPC- based application, uses TCP port 135, also referred to as the location
service that helps RPC applications to query for the port number of a service.

The Exchange Server computer monitors port 135 for client connections to the RPC
endpoint mapper service. After a client connects to a socket, the Exchange
Server computer allocates the client two random ports to use to communicate with
the directory and the information store. The client does not communicate with
other components of the Exchange Server computer.

If security concerns for a network infrastructure require blocking of any ports
other than the ones used, then the random assignment of ports for communication
with the directory and the information store can become a roadblock. To avoid
this, Exchange Server versions 4.0 and later allow you to statically allocate
these ports.

For more information on the process of static allocation of ports for the
directory and the information store, please see Microsoft Knowledge Base article
Q155831 "XADM: Setting TCP/IP Ports for Exchange and Outlook Client Connections
Through a Firewall."

At this juncture, for successful communication between client and server, the
firewall needs to be configured to allow TCP connections to port 135 and all
statically allocated ports. If you need to monitor traffic for analysis, these
are the ports to monitor.

Communication between two Exchange Server computers in the same site
--------------------------------------------------------------------

All intrasite communication between Exchange Server computers uses RPC.
Consequently, access to TCP port 135 becomes an important variable in the
ability of Exchange Server computers to communicate if they are separated using
routers and firewalls.

Communication between two Exchange Server computers within a site is between the
two message transfer agents (MTAs) and the two directory services. No other
components of the Exchange Server computers communicate directly.

As discussed above in client to server communication, an Exchange Server computer
monitors port 135 for connections to the RPC endpoint mapper service. When an
initiating Exchange Server computer connects to a socket, the receiving Exchange
Server computer assigns two random ports to use to communicate with the
directory and the MTA.

Already discussed above was the possibility of static allocation of a TCP port
for the directory to listen and communicate on a specific port number. With the
release of Exchange Server 4.0 Service Pack 4 and all releases of Exchange
Server 5.0, a similar adjustment can be made for the MTA. The endpoint mapper
will then relay the appropriate port number, so that further communication can
be achieved by going to the port number specified. For establishing a static
allocation of port for the MTA, refer to the latter part of Knowledge Base
article Q161931, "XCON: Configuring MTA TCP/IP Port # for X.400 and RPC
Listens." This explains the use of the registry value "TCP/IP port for RPC
listens".

Consequently, for successful communication between two servers, the firewall
needs to be configured to allow TCP connections to port 135 and all statically
allocated ports. If you need to monitor traffic for analysis, these are the
ports to monitor.

For more information about the ramifications and guidelines for static port
assignment of Exchange services, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Communication between two Exchange Server computers in different sites
----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Intersite link uses site connector (RPC):

Most of the discussion on intersite communication via site connectors mirrors the
situation of intrasite communication between Exchange Server computers. The only
difference is that communication between Exchange Server computers installed in
two different sites is only via the corresponding message transfer agents
(MTAs).

Although you continue to need the services of the RPC locator service and thereby
port 135, the only adjustment you may need for static allocation of a port would
be for the MTA. Again, refer to Knowledge Base article Q161931, "XCON:
Configuring MTA TCP/IP Port # for X.400 and RPC Listens." This article discusses
the use of the registry value "TCP/IP port for RPC listens". This feature is
available with Exchange Server Service Pack 4 and all releases of Exchange
Server 5.0.

- Intersite link is an X.400 connector:

If the intersite link is an X.400 connector, then the communication between the
two Exchange Server computers continues to be between corresponding MTAs only.
However, RPC is not the means of such communication. Communication between the
MTAs follows the RFC1006: ISO over TCP/IP. Consequently Exchange Server
computers, by default, use TCP port 102 for all such communication between the
MTAs. There is no need for TCP port 135 as far the Exchange communication is
concerned, because no RPC traffic is involved.

Exchange Server Service Pack 4 and all releases of Exchange Server 5.0 provide
the ability to change this default port assignment of port 102. Article Q161931,
referred to above, discusses the use of the registry value "RFC1006 Port
Number".

In this setting, for successful communication between two servers, the firewall
must be configured to allow TCP connections to TCP port 102 or the manually
assigned replacement port. If you need to monitor traffic for analysis, these
are the ports to monitor.

IMPORTANT: If the port number for RFC1006 is changed from the default value of
102 on one server, then it is absolutely essential that all servers
communicating via the X.400 connector incorporate this change. All MTAs must use
the same port number.

Finally, as you analyze your specific situation, keep in mind that several
combinations of the above situations can exist in an Exchange infrastructure.
