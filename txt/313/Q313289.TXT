SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article describes how to schedule a tape backup job on a
Windows NT Workstation 4.0-based or Windows NT Server 4.0-based computer. The
three-part process involves creating a batch file that contains the appropriate
backup commands, configuring the Schedule (or Task Scheduler) service to start
automatically, and then using the At.exe command to schedule the Windows NT
Backup program to run. After you have scheduled the backup job, it will run
automatically.

Requirements
------------

 - A computer (that meets the requirements that are listed on the appropriate
   Hardware Compatibility List) on which Windows NT Server 4.0 or Windows NT
   Workstation 4.0 is installed.

 - A tape drive (that meets the requirements listed on the Hardware
   Compatibility List) must be installed in the computer, and a tape must be
   inserted in the drive.

Using the At.exe Command to Schedule a Backup Job on a Windows NT 4.0-Based Computer
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Backup jobs are commonly run after business hours, when users do not have program
files open and when system-resource usage is low. Using the At.exe command to
schedule a backup job to run automatically can be a great convenience for the
administrator, because it eliminates the need for a staff member to be present
and manually complete this task.

Creating a Batch File for the Backup Job:

The first part of scheduling a backup job is creating a batch file that contains
all of the commands that are required to complete the backup job. Windows NT
Backup is the program that is used to create the backup job, and this program is
included with the Windows NT 4.0 operating system. To create a batch file for
the backup job:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then click Notepad.

2. In Notepad, type the appropriate commands to complete a backup of the files
   you want to back up, and then press ENTER. The command line utility that is
   used to create a backup job is Ntbackup.exe. The syntax for creating a backup
   job by using Ntbackup.exe is:

   ntbackup backup path nameoptions

   The following list describes the switches that you can use with Ntbackup.exe:

    - /a - Appends the backup set after any existing backup sets, rather than
      replacing it. This switch is not available for a blank tape.
    - /b - Backs up the local registry, but only if you back up another file
      from the same volume.
    - /d "text" - Describes the backup set. This description appears when you
      view the tape catalog.
    - /e - Logs exceptions, such as a summary log. If you do not use this
      switch, a full detail log is created.
    - /l file name - Assigns a file name to the log file. The default file name
      is Backup.log, and this file is located in the \Systemroot folder.
    - /r - Limits access to the tape to administrators, backup operators, or the
      user that created the backup. If this switch is not used, anyone with the
      restore right can restore the backup set.
    - /t - Specifies the backup type, either Normal, Copy, Incremental,
      Differential or Daily, and the default backup type is normal. For example,
      /t Copy, or /t Incremental.
    - /v - Confirms that the files were backed up accurately.
    - /hc: - Enables or disables hardware compression for tape drives that
      support it, and is either on or off. For example, /hc:on, or /hc:off. The
      default is hardware compression off.

   For example, to complete a normal backup of drive C, drive D, and the registry
   on a Windows NT 4.0-based computer, by using hardware compression and
   verifying that the data was backed up correctly, you would use the "ntbackup
   backup c: d: /b /hc:on /v" (without the quotation marks) command.

3. On the Notepad File menu, click Save As. In the Save As dialog box, select a
   drive and a folder in which to store the batch file. In the "Save as type"
   box, click All Files. In the "File name" box, type a name for the batch file
   that uses a .cmd file extension (for example, "Backup.cmd" (without the
   quotation marks)). Click Save.

4. Quit Notepad to complete the process of creating a batch file for the backup
   job.

Configuring the Schedule Service to Start Automatically:

By default, the Schedule service is configured to start manually. To use the
At.exe command to schedule an automatic backup job, you must configure the
Schedule service to start automatically. After you complete this task, the
schedule service starts automatically every time you start the computer.

NOTE: If Internet Explorer 4.0 or later is installed on your Windows NT 4.0-based
computer, the Schedule service is called the Task Scheduler service. Task
Scheduler may or may not already be configured to start automatically, depending
on the version of Internet Explorer you use. To configure the Schedule service
to start automatically:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
   Services.

2. In the Services dialog box, click Schedule (or Task Scheduler if you are
   running Internet Explorer 4.0 or later), and then click Start. After the
   service starts, click Startup.

3. In the Service dialog box, click Automatic, and then click OK.

4. In the Services dialog box, click Close.

5. Close Control Panel to complete the process of configuring the Schedule
   service to start automatically.

Using the At.exe Command to Schedule a Backup Job:

Now you're ready to use the At.exe command and the batch file that you created in
the "Creating a Batch File for the Backup Job" section of this article to
schedule an automatic tape backup job. To use the At.exe command to schedule a
backup job:

1. Click Start, click Run, type "cmd" (without the quotation marks), and then
   click OK.

2. At the command prompt, type the appropriate commands to schedule the backup
   job to run automatically by using the batch file that you created in the
   "Creating a Batch File for the Backup Job" section of this article, and then
   press ENTER. The command-line utility that is used to schedule a task to run
   is At.exe. The syntax for using the At.exe command is:

   at \\computer nameid/delete time
   /interactive/every:date[,...]/next:date[,...] "command"

   The following list describes the switches that you can use with the At.exe
   command:

    - \\computer name - Specifies a remote computer. If you omit this switch,
      the commands are scheduled on the local computer.
    - id - Assigns an identification number to a scheduled command.
    - /delete - Cancels a scheduled command. If you use this switch and omit an
      id, all of the scheduled commands on the computer are canceled.
    - time - Specifies the time that the command is to run. Time is expressed as
      hour:minutes in 24-hour notation. It runs 00:00 (midnight) though 23:59.
    - /interactive - Allows the backup job to interact with the desktop of the
      user that is logged on at the time the backup job runs. If omitted, the
      backup job runs, but is not visible on the desktop.
    - /every:date[,...] - Specifies the weekdays or days of the month that a
      command is to run. Specify date as one or more days of the week
      (M,T,W,Th,F,S,Su) or one or more days of the month (by using numbers 1
      through 31). If you omit this switch, the default is the current day of
      the month.
    - /next:date[,...] - Specifies the next weekdays or days of the month a
      command is to run. If you omit this switch, the default is the current day
      of the month.
    - command - Specifies the program or batch file to run, such as
      C:\Backup.cmd.

   For example, to schedule a backup to run at 23:00 every weekday by using the
   C:\Backup.cmd batch file, you would use the "at 23:00 /every:M,T,W,Th,F
   "c:\Backup.cmd"" (without the quotation marks) At.exe command.

3. At the command prompt, type "exit" (without the quotation marks), and then
   press ENTER to complete the scheduling of an automatic tape backup job by
   using the At.exe command. The backup will run, automatically, on the days and
   times that you specified.
