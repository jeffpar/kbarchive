TITLE   :Encarta 94: MindMaze Doesn't Work with 95 ENCARAPI.DLL
PRODUCT :Microsoft Home Multimedia Titles
PROD/VER::1994 editions
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:win31

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Encarta 1994 The Complete Multimedia Encyclopedia 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you select the Ref button in Encarta 1994's MindMaze game, the system
freezes. After pressing any key, a general protection (GP) fault in module
GAMEUTIL occurs.

RESOLUTION
==========

This can be caused by the Microsoft Encarta for Windows, 1995 edition or
Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia for Windows, 1996 edition Encarapi.dll file. Copy
the 1994 version of this file from the CD to the Encarta 1994 directory on your
hard drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Both Encarta 1995 and Encarta 96 use a file called Encarapi.dll. This is a
shared file, used by several programs, so it is copied to the Windows System
folder. Unfortunately it is not compatible with the Encarta 1994 MindMaze game.
After copying the 1994 version of Encarapi.dll into the Encarta 1994 working
directory, Encarta 1994 will always uses the earlier version. Other programs,
such as Encarta 1995 or Multimedia Works for Windows, will continue to use the
new version in the System folder.

If Encarta 1995 or 1996 are no longer on the system, delete Encarapi.dll and then
reinstall Encarta 1994.

If more than one version of Encarta is being used, follow the steps below to
direct Encarta 1994 to use the appropriate copy of Encarapi.dll.

NOTE: All versions of Encarta need to be installed in separate directories.

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Taskbar.

2. Click the Start Menu Programs tab.

3. Click the Advanced button.

4. Double-click the Programs folder, and then double-click the Microsoft

   Properties.

6. Click the Shortcut tab, and note the Start In entry.

7. If Start In refers to your CD-ROM drive (slow installation), change the Start
   In entry to D:\ENCARTA\ENCARAPI, where drive D is your CD-ROM drive and click
   OK. Note: if your CD-ROM drive is a different drive letter, replace "D" above
   with the letter of your CD-ROM drive.

8. If the Start In refers to your hard drive, cancel the Properties sheet,
   insert the Encarta 1994 CD, and type the following command at the MS-DOS
   prompt:

   "COPY D:\ENCARTA\ENCARAPI\ENCARAPI.DLL C:\ENC94" (without the quotation
   marks)

   where D is the letter of your CD-ROM drive, and C:\Enc94 is your Encarta 1994
   folder. (If your CD-ROM drive is a different drive letter, replace "D" above

   drive and click OK. (If your CD-ROM drive is a different drive letter,
   replace "D" above with the letter of your CD-ROM drive.)

   and type the following command at the MS-DOS prompt

   "COPY D:\ENCARTA\ENCARAPI\ENCARAPI.DLL C:\ENC94" (without the quotation
