SUMMARY
=======

This article describes some of the resources available for debugging
applications created with the Microsoft Windows CE Toolkit for Visual Basic
(VBCE).

MORE INFORMATION
================

A VBCE program is handled differently by the integrated development environment
(IDE) than a regular Visual Basic application. VBCE programs are completely
compiled into .pvb files before they are handed off to pvb.exe, which actually
runs the code in the program. VBCE programs run completely outside of the Visual
Basic IDE, so there is no compile on demand as in regular Visual Basic. Only
very basic syntax checking is done by the add-in (CEIDE.DLL) when the program is
compiled; therefore, some errors will not be caught until run-time.

Debugger
--------

VBCE comes with a separate Debugger utility (VBDBG.EXE) for debugging Windows CE
applications. The Debugger runs as a separate program outside of the Visual
Basic IDE, therefore some of the debugging options available in the Visual Basic
IDE are not supported by the toolkit.

The Debugger includes several useful windows: A Watch Window displays the values
of variables or expressions during execution. An Immediate Window allows small
code statements to run. A Call Stack shows procedures in execution. An Object
window shows the hierarchy of running objects. Objects can be opened to view
their code, add breakpoints, etc. Applications are compiled before reaching the
debugger, so application code cannot be edited in the debugger's Immediate
Window. Because all errors, other than syntax errors, are caught at run-time,
applications must be running in either the emulated or remote Windows CE
environment before you can begin the debugging process. Though most debugging is
done while in emulation mode, you should also debug your application on the
remote device in order to ensure your application is error-free.

Breakpoints entered in the Visual Basic IDE will not be recognized in the
Debugger, but breakpoints can be added in the Debugger's code window for the
object.

Error Trapping
--------------

The "On Error Resume Next" statement is useful when performing inline error
handling. This statement is the only error handling statement the toolkit
currently supports. On Error Resume Next does not clear the Err object, so you
can use inline error handling to display a meaningful error messages rather than
displaying the generic "Application Error" message.

Although VBCE programs keep running after generating an application error,
execution of the current procedure halts unless an On Error Resume Next
statement is in the procedure and before where the error occurred.

The Debug object is not supported in VBCE. Alternative strategies could be using
the File control to log information about program execution or using MsgBoxes
and controls to display program status.

The "On Error GoTo 0" line is included in VBCE to disable inline error handling.
If you use this line in code, subsequent errors may cause executing code to
stop, although the rest of the application will continue.

Err Object
----------

Run-time errors produce a generic Application Error dialog box with the message:

   An error was encountered while running this program.

There is no other information about what may have caused the error, and no Help
button to retrieve information from the online Help files. When an application
error occurs, the Err object is loaded with the error number and a description
of the error.

You can check the Err object in your code in various ways, including displaying
the error information in a MsgBox, such as:

   MsgBox <Err.Number> vbCrLf <Err.Description>

If the error is coming from a control, the Err.Source property can be checked.
Usually, the Err object supplies enough information to determine what caused the
error. Tracing through a program with the debugger can reveal more information.
After code is modified, recompile the .pvb to test your changes. If a program is
still running on the device or emulator, it must be closed before trying to run
it again from the IDE.
