SUMMARY
=======

One common programming problem in Visual Basic is the need to enumerate all
processes and the associated files (modules) loaded into memory. The Task
Manager under Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 is a perfect example of this. The
first tab of the Task Manager lists all application windows on the desktop. The
second tab of the Task Manager lists all the processes in the system. This
article provides details on how to list these processes and the modules for each
process in Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows NT, and Windows 2000.

Modlist.exe is a sample project that shows how to list all the processes and
their modules under Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows NT, and Windows
2000.

In addition to the information below, the sample code included in Modlist.exe
includes extensive comments describing how the code works. It may be useful to
follow the code flow in the sample while reading this article.

The first thing to note when enumerating the processes of the operating system is
that the necessary API functions are completely different under Windows 95/98/Me
and Windows NT/2000. Under Windows 95/98/Me, functions from the ToolHelp32 group
of APIs are used. Under Windows NT/2000, functions from PSAPI.DLL are used.

Windows 95/98/Me and ToolHelp32
-------------------------------

The Toolhelp32 APIs used under Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows Me reside in
the KERNEL32.DLL. These API functions are available only under Windows 95,
Windows 98, and Windows Me. The following ToolHelp32 functions allow you to
enumerate processes in the system, as well as get memory and module
information:

   CreateToolhelp32Snapshot()
   Process32First()
   Process32Next()
   Module32First()
   Module32Next()

The first step is to create a "snapshot" of the information in the system using
the CreateToolhelp32Snapshot() function. This function allows you to choose what
type of information is stored in the snapshot. The Modlist sample initially
specifies the TH32CS_SNAPPROCESS flag because you are interested in process
information. This function returns a handle to a PROCESSENTRY32 structure, and
it is important to remember to pass the handle to CloseHandle() when processing
is complete. To iterate through the list of processes in the snapshot, call
Process32First once, followed by repeated calls to Process32Next, until one of
these functions returns FALSE. Both of these functions take the handle to the
snapshot and a pointer to a PROCESSENTRY32 structure as parameters.
Process32First and Process32Next fill a PROCESSENTRY32 structure with useful
information about a process in the system.

The process ID is in the th32ProcessID member of the structure. The process'
executable file and path are stored in the szExeFile member of the structure.
Other useful information is also available in the structure. The Modlist sample
only retrieves the EXE name and adds it to a listbox. The process ID can be
passed to the OpenProcess() API to get a handle to the process.

With a valid process id, you can again call the CreateToolHelp32Snapshot() to
retrieve module information for the process. This secondary call to
CreateToolHelp32Snapshot() passes the TH32CS_SNAPMODULE flag and a pointer to
the process ID (th32ProcessID value of the PROCESSENTRY32 structure) as the
parameters, and creates a snapshot of the modules in that process.

Again, this function returns a HANDLE and it is important to remember to close
the handle, using CloseHandle(), after retrieving information about the
process.

In a manner similar to retrieving process information, Module32First is called
once and Module32Next is called as many times as required to iterate through the
modules information for the process.

Windows NT, Windows 2000, and the PSAPI.DLL
-------------------------------------------

The Windows NT and Windows 2000 approach to creating a list of processes and
modules uses functions from the PSAPI.DLL. The PSAPI.DLL file is distributed
with the Platform SDK, available at:

   http://www.microsoft.com/msdn/sdk

Like the ToolHelp32 functions, the PSAPI.DLL also contains a variety of useful
functions. However, this article only discusses those functions relevant to
enumerating processes and modules:

   EnumProcesses()
   EnumProcessModules()
   GetModuleFileNameExA()

First, a call is made to EnumProcesses() to fill an array of process IDs. The
ModList sample code also includes a method of calculating the number of
processes returned.

Next, OpenProcess() is called for each of the process IDs to retrieve a handle to
the process, if the handle is valid, then call EnumProcessModules() to enumerate
the modules of the process. EnumProcessModules() fills an array passed as a
parameter, with the module handles associated with the process.

GetModuleFileNameExA() is used to retrieve the name of the module using the
process handle and module handle as parameters. The module name would be the
path and file name of the dll, ocx, etc., that the process has loaded.

In ModList, a module name is indented in the listbox to show it to be a "child"
under the process it is associated with.

Additional notes
----------------

The name of a process may also be displayed in the list of modules for that
process. If this is not desirable, simply compare the module name to the process
name before adding it to the list.

In Windows 95, 16-bit applications have process IDs etc., just like Win32
applications. Therefore, they are reported equally by Toolhelp32 functions.
However, this is not the case under Windows NT. 16-Bit applications running
under Windows NT and Windows 2000 run in what is called a Virtual Dos Machine
(VDM). EnumProcesses will not recognize any 16-bit applications in the system.
However, it will return the 32-bit NTVDM processes under which the 16-bit
applications are running. In order to enumerate 16-bit applications under
Windows NT and Windows 2000, you must use a function called VDMEnumTaskWOWEx().

Use if VDMEnumTaskWOWEx() is not covered in this article or the ModList sample.
