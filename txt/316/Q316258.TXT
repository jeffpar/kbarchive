======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a program that does not set the WBEM security level to
Impersonate (wbemImpersonationLevelImpersonate (3)) during a connection to the
Systems Management Server (SMS) provider, the SMS provider may obtain the
incorrect user groups to which that user belongs. The user may then have more or
less access rights in a running SMS Administration console (or program that uses
the SMS SDK) than is defined in the SMS Security rights.

CAUSE
=====

The SMS Provider is incorrectly dealing with provider connections which are not
setting the DCOM security level to Impersonate.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

   http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The hotfix originally provided for the problem that is described in this
Microsoft Knowledge Base article is no longer available. The hotfix for the
following Microsoft Knowledge Base article now supercedes it. For additional
information, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

   Q324204 SMS: Collections That Are Based on Complex Queries Do Not Update

If you want to resolve the problem that is described in this article, you must
install the hotfix for Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q324204.



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, always set the WBEM authentication level to
Impersonate in any program or script that connects to the SMS provider.

If you are using the WMI Scripting API, verify that the registry on the computer
that is running the script has a default impersonation level set in the
registry:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the Default Impersonation Level value under the following key in the
   registry:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\WBEM\Scripting

3. Verify that the REG_DWORD value is set to 0x3.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

If the SMS Service account has security rights in the SMS Administrator console
by way of account or group membership, either remove or restrict the rights as
it is the group membership for this account which may be incorrectly checked for
access.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
the Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4 Hotfix Rollup Package (HRP).

How to Install the Hotfix
-------------------------

Apply this fix on all of the sites in the SMS hierarchy, including the SMS
provider if it is located on a separate database server. To install the fix, use
one of the following methods.

How to Use the Hotfix Installer:

NOTE: You can use this method only on Intel-based computers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a local folder on your site server or to
   a share on your network. The I386 and Alpha subfolders are required; you must
   also download them from the Microsoft FTP site. It is important to keep the
   folder structure intact. The Q316258.exe file is a Microsoft Windows
   Installer file that updates specific files on your site server.

2. Log on to your site server by using an account with administrator rights.

3. On the site server, quit the SMS Administrator console.

4. Run the Q316258.exe file and follow the instructions in the wizard. The SMS
   services are stopped and restarted as part of the installation process.

How to Manually Install the Hotfix:

1. Copy the update program file (Q316258.exe) and platform folders to a new
   folder. The folder structure must be such that the program file is located
   one folder "above" the platform folders.

2. Quit the SMS Administrator console and stop all SMS services in Control
   Panel. If the SMS_SITE_BACKUP service is running, stop it also.

3. If the SMS provider is located on a separate SQL server, also perform the
   steps that are associated with SMS provider de-registration, file replacement
   and re-registration on that server.

4. On the server on which the SMS provider is running, stop the Winmgmt service.

5. On the server on which the SMS provider is running, unregister the SMS
   Provider that is located in the SMS\BIN\<platform> folder by using the
   "regsvr32 /u smsprov.dll" (without the quotation marks) command.

6. On the server on which the SMS provider is running, replace the Smsprov.dll
   file in the SMS\BIN\<platform> folder with the version that is located
   in the hotfix <platform> folder.

7. Replace the Basesvr.dll file in the SMS\BIN\<platform> folder with the
   version that is located in the hotfix <platform> folder.

8. Replace the Compmgr.exe file in the SMS\BIN\<platform> folder with the
   version that is located in the hotfix <platform> folder.

9. Replace the Cmprov.dll file in the SMS\BIN\<platform> folder with the
   version that is located in the hotfix <platform> folder.

10. On the server on which the SMS provider is running, register the SMS
   Provider DLL in the SMS\BIN\<platform> folder by using the
   "regsvr32.exe smsprov.dll" (without the quotation marks) command.

11. On the server on which the SMS provider is running, start the Winmgmt
   service.

12. Restart the SMS site services.

Sample VbScript of how to set the WBEM authentication level when you connect to
the SMS Provider:

   '++++++ Example script to output Sitecode and Sitename for each site +++++
   Option Explicit
   Dim oLocator
   Dim oServices
   Dim sServer, sSiteCode
   'Setting the constant to 3 (Allows objects to use the credentials of the
   caller)
   Const wbemImpersonationLevelImpersonate = 3
   ' Create locator, needed to connect to WMI namespaces
   Set oLocator = CreateObject("WbemScripting.SWbemLocator")
   sServer = InputBox ("SMS Site Server Name")
   sSiteCode = InputBox ("SMS Code Code")
   Set oServices = oLocator.ConnectServer(sServer, "root\sms\site_" &
   sSiteCode)
   ' Set security impersonation level
   oServices.Security_.ImpersonationLevel = wbemImpersonationLevelImpersonate
   For Each Site in Sites
   MsgBox "Sitecode =" & Site.SiteCode & ", Site Name ="
   &Site.SiteName
   Next
   Set oLocator=Nothing
   Set oServices=Nothing
   Set Sites=Nothing
   Set Site=Nothing

Before you install the hotfix, when a client tries to connect to the SMS provider
without impersonation, you may receive the following entry in the SMS provider
log (Smsprov.log):

   -- Updating NT Group membership
   !!!Client connected without impersonation - group membership may be
   incomplete!!

With the hotfix installed, the SMS provider will log the following in its log
file. The SMS provider will not allow a connection without impersonation set.

   Client connected without impersonation activated, cannot retrieve group
   membership. Set the impersonation level to impersonate in the client
   application.
