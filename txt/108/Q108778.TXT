Features of the HP LaserJet 4 Family Printer Driver

The Hewlett-Packard LASERJET 4 FAMILY PRINTING SYSTEM version
31.V1.26 includes support for the HP LaserJet 4/4M, 4L, 4ML,
4Si/4Si MX, & 4P/4MP printers and the following features:

Support for Graphics Quality
----------------------------

   For the LaserJet 4/4M, 4Si/4Si MX, and 4P/4MP at 600 dpi mode
   the driver supports 600, 300, and 150 dpi. For the LaserJet 4/4M,
   4L, 4ML, 4Si/4Si MX, and 4P/4MP, at 300 dpi mode the driver supports
   300, 150, and 75 dpi. The actual graphics resolution settings are
   denoted by the descriptive terms of High, Medium, and Low rather
   than the actual dpi.

Support for the Internal Intellifont Typefaces
----------------------------------------------

   All the internal Intellifont typefaces in the HP LaserJet 4/4M,
   4L, 4ML, 4Si/4Si MX, 4P/4MP printers are supported in the 19U symbol
   set.

Support for HP-GL/2
-------------------

   Support for HP-GL/2 is in the HPPCL5E PRINTER DRIVER. Under the
   Options Dialog in the Printer Setup, an option of "Graphics Mode" is
   available. Two options are present: HP-GL/2 or Raster. The first
   choice enables HP-GL/2 and raster printing which optimizes print
   performance. The second choice uses raster only. The default graphics
   mode is set to raster for the HP LaserJet 4L. The default mode is set
   to HP-GL/2 for the HP LaserJet 4/4M, 4ML, 4Si/4Si MX, and 4P/MP. Default
   settings for "Graphics Mode" optimize print speed for the given printer.

   If you encounter print difficulties in HP-GL/2 Graphics Mode, it is
   recommended that you change the mode to Raster and try your print job
   again. Additional information on this topic may be found in the help
   files that accompany this driver. Choose Help from the driver dialog
   screens or the HP font installer screens to access the HELP information.

Support for EconoMode (Supported by the LaserJet 4L, 4ML, and 4P/4MP)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

   Support for EconoMode is in version V1.20 or later within the
   Options Dialog. There are two options available, on or off. With
   EconoMode enabled the output will resemble draft mode, using fewer
   dots in order to conserve toner.

Support for Print Density
-------------------------

   (Supported by the LaserJet 4L, 4ML, and 4P/4MP)

   Print density support is provided in the Options Dialog. Adjust
   the density of the printer according to the desired density. The
   density range is one (lightest) to five (darkest). Dialog Support for
   REt. Another feature added to the Option Dialog is the REt (Resolution
   Enhancement technology) box. The options here are: Light, Medium, Dark,
   and Off for the HP LaserJet 4L, 4ML, and 4P/4MP. Printer Default,
   Light, Medium, Dark, and Off for the HP LaserJet 4/4M. Printer Default,
   ON, and OFF for the LaserJet 4Si/4Si MX. Dialog Support for Resource
   Saving (Supported only by LaserJet 4Si/4Si MX)   This feature, added
   to the main setup dialog box, allows the user to tell the printer
   driver how much memory is set aside for each printer personality
   (PCL and PostScript). This memory is used for saving printer resources
   between printer language switching. The range is 0KB to 99900KB.

Version Information Resources
-----------------------------

   This feature in version 31.V1.20 and later, added to the printer
   driver and its dynamic link libraries, helps eliminate a possible
   mismatch of driver and driver resource files when installing previous
   drivers. If a potential mismatch is detected during driver
   installation, a dialog box that contains a warning is displayed.

Custom Media Size
-----------------

   Custom Media is also supported by this driver for the HP LaserJet
   4ML and 4P/4MP. The size of the custom media in most cases must be set
   in both the application's page setup and the driver setup. For more
   information about minimum and maximum page size, see your users manual.

   from the Control Panel,  Printers,  Setup,  Fonts,  Add Fonts option in
   Windows. Detailed installation instructions are included with the PCM
   files.

300 DPI Compatibility
---------------------

   Additional compatibility has been added to this driver to insure
   compatibility between documents printed with this driver and documents
   printed with the LaserJet III Family drivers. This compatibility is
   automatically enabled when a document is printed with the resolution
   field set to 300 DPI.

Driver Supports Microsoft Draw Image Imported in Word in Monochrome
-------------------------------------------------------------------

   Graphics can be imported as both black and white or as monochrome.
