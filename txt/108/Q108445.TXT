The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
 - Microsoft Creative Writer for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
 - Microsoft Fine Artist for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a

SYMPTOMS
========

If you save and name a document in the Control Room without having named it
first in the program, it may seem that the file has not been saved at all.

When you return to normal mode, the document name is still "A New Document"
(without the quotation marks). Creative Writer and Fine Artist don't show the
name you gave the document in the Control Room Save As section.

If you close the document and then try to find it again, it doesn't appear in the
portfolio. It also isn't listed as the document you worked on most recently.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the following steps to locate a file you named only in the Control Room.

In Windows 95
-------------

1. Exit Creative Writer or Fine Artist.

2. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click Windows Explorer.

3. Locate the document you saved in the MSKIDS directory. Or, on the Tool menu,
   choose Find and type in the filename.

4. Double-click the file name.

The program starts, with the selected document open.

In Windows 3.x
--------------

1. Exit Creative Writer or Fine Artist.

2. Start File Manager (usually located in the Main Program Group).

3. Search the MSKIDS directory for the name you gave the document when you saved
   it in the Control Room.

4. When you find the file, double-click the filename.

The program starts with the selected document open.

On the Macintosh
----------------

1. Exit Creative Writer or Fine Artist.

2. In Finder, open the MSKids folder (or the folder to which you saved the
   document).

3. Locate the document and double-click it.

The program starts, with the selected document open.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the programs listed at the top
of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

The Control Room can be used to save files under specific MS-DOS filenames and/or
to specific locations. By default, unless you specify another drive or
directory, documents saved in the Control Room are saved to the MSKIDS directory
or folder. If you save a document from inside Creative Writer or Fine Artist,
however, it is given a 32-character name and is saved by default into your own
subdirectory.

NOTE: To enter the Control Room in Windows, press and hold down the CTRL key and
the SHIFT key while you press the A key (CTRL+SHIFT+A). To enter the Control
Room in Macintosh versions, press and hold down the COMMAND key and the SHIFT
key while you press the A key (COMMAND+SHIFT+A).
