PRODUCT :Microsoft Developer Network
PROD/VER:WINDOWS:6.0

KEYWORDS:kbHTMLHelp kbMSDN kbOSWin2000 kbVS kbDSupport kbGrpDSTools

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) 
 - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
 - Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Several problems can occur when you use the Windows 2000 Multiple User Interface
(MUI) features with the MSDN Library and Visual Studio 6.0. These problems
include the following:

 - When installing Visual Studio 6.0 or the MSDN Library, Setup displays garbage
   characters.

 - After the installation of the English MSDN Library, you cannot locate the
   MSDN*.col file.

 - The MSDN Library displays garbage characters when started.

 - User-defined subset names are not displayed correctly.

CAUSE
=====

These problems occur when you try to use Multiple User Interface features
because the MSDN Library and its Setup are not Unicode enabled. Specifically,
these problems can be traced to the following actions:

 - Changing the default system locale or menu and dialogs to a locale different
   from that of Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 or the MSDN Library.

 - Installing the English version of the MSDN Library to a path containing
   non-ASCII characters.

 - Using non-ASCII characters to save MSDN Library subsets.

RESOLUTION
==========

When installing or using the MSDN Library or Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0, verify
that their locale (for example, the Japanese version of either) matches the
default system locale and the locale for menus and dialogs. To check this for
the system:

1. On the Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Regional Options icon.

3. Click Set default to view or change the current default system locale under
   Your locale (location).

4. Verify that the setting for Menus and dialogs is to the same locale.

When installing the MSDN Library, chose a destination path containing only ASCII
characters. When saving a subset, select a name containing only ASCII
characters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
