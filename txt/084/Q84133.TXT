SUMMARY
=======

Some combinations of modal and modeless dialog boxes create undesirable side
effects due to their design and implementation. This article describes the side
effects and methods to avoid them. The following list of side effects may not be
complete, and will be updated as additional side effects are discovered.

Side Effects
------------

1. Unable to change focus with the keyboard if a modeless dialog box is created
   as the child of an active modal dialog box.

2. Unable to change focus with the keyboard if a modeless dialog box is owned by
   an active modal dialog box.

3. Input focus moves to another application if a modeless dialog box is
   destroyed during processing of the WM_INITDIALOG message of a modal dialog
   box owned by the application's top-level window.

Dlgs.exe is a file in the Microsoft Software Library that demonstrates the three
side effects listed above, explains the causes of each, and demonstrates the
method listed below to avoid each problem.

Sections A and B below list some characteristics of the design and implementation
of modal and modeless dialog boxes. Section C below explains the causes of the
side effects listed above and techniques to avoid these side effects.

Section A: Characteristics of a Modal Dialog Box
------------------------------------------------

 - A modal dialog box has its own message loop to process messages from the
   application's queue without involving the application's message loop. This
   private message loop is active as long as the modal dialog is active.

 - A modal dialog box disables its owner to prevent the owner from processing
   input. By default, a modal dialog box disables only one window; the other
   windows remain enabled and can process user input unless they are explicitly
   disabled.

Section B: Characteristics of a Modeless Dialog Box
---------------------------------------------------

 - A modeless dialog box does not disable its owner window. Therefore, the user
   can continue to work with the owner window while the modeless dialog box is
   displayed.

 - A modeless dialog receives its messages through the application's main
   message loop.

 - An application typically calls the IsDialogMessage() function to process
   keyboard input for the modeless dialog box. IsDialogMessage() handles
   changing the focus between controls using the keyboard.

Section C: Explaining the Side Effects
--------------------------------------

Side Effect 1
-------------

Symptoms

When a modeless dialog box is created as a child of a modal dialog box, the
keyboard cannot be used to change the focus.

Cause

The modal dialog box's message loop does not provide the functionality of the
IsDialogMessage() function.

Resolution

Substitute a modeless dialog box for the modal dialog box. To make the parent
modeless dialog box appear modal, disable its owner window in the code to
process the WM_INITDIALOG message.

When a modal dialog box is in its message loop, all windows in the application,
including each modeless dialog box, receive its messages from the modal dialog
box's message loop. However, this message loop does not provide the
functionality of IsDialogMessage().

Side Effect 2
-------------

Symptoms

When a modeless dialog box is owned by a modal dialog box, the keyboard cannot be
used to change the focus.

Cause

The modal dialog box's message loop does not provide the functionality of the
IsDialogMessage() function.

Resolution

Substitute a modeless dialog box for the modal dialog box. To make the parent
modeless dialog box appear modal, disable its owner window in the code to
process the WM_INITDIALOG message.

Side Effect 3
-------------

Symptoms

If a modeless dialog box is destroyed during the processing of the WM_INITDIALOG
message for a modal dialog box owned by the application's top- level window, the
focus moves to another application.

Cause

No window is available to receive the focus.

Resolution

Substitute a modeless dialog box for the modal dialog box, as above. Disable the
owner window (to simulate modality) only after the modeless dialog box is
destroyed. Then Windows can put the input focus back to the top window until the
simulated modal dialog box is displayed.

Windows sends a WM_INITDIALOG message to a modal dialog box just before the
dialog is made visible. As part of destroying a window that has the input focus,
Windows removes the focus from the window and gives the focus to another window.
If the new modal dialog box destroys the modeless dialog box as it processes a
WM_INITDIALOG message, the modal dialog box is not yet visible and cannot
receive the input focus. Unless the application has other visible windows, the
only window that can receive the input focus is the top-level window. However,
because the top-level window owns the new modal dialog box, it is disabled and
cannot receive the input focus.

Because none of the active application's windows are eligible to receive the
input focus, Windows activates another application and gives the input focus to
one of its windows. When this other application receives the focus, it moves to
the front, over the application that created the modal dialog box. As soon as
the original application processes the WM_INITDIALOG message, the modal dialog
box is displayed and brought to the front.

The scenario above causes another application to be "sandwiched" between the
application's main window and the modal dialog box, which may confuse the user.
The following diagram illustrates the visual effect:

   +------------------------------------------------------------+
   |         Application 1's Main Window                        |
   |  +-------------------------------------------------------+ |
   |  |       Application 2's Main Window                     | |
   |  |       (on top of application 1's main window)         | |
   |  | +---------------------------------------------------+ | |
   |  | |      Application 1's Modal Dialog                 | | |
   |  | |      (on top of application 2)                    | | |
   |  | |                                                   | | |
