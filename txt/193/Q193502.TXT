 - Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, on platform(s):
    - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT

SYMPTOMS
========

Running a Visual FoxPro form through a READ EVENTS command without a CLEAR
EVENTS command, produces an error dialog box, which contains an OK button. The
following text displays in the error dialog box:

   Cannot Quit Visual FoxPro

If the OK button is not selected and the error dialog box remains on the Visual
FoxPro screen, when End Task is selected from the Task Manager, one of the
following system errors appear (depending on the version of the operating
system):

 - In Windows 95, and in Windows 98, using Visual FoxPro 5.0x, the following
   error displays:

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.

   Clicking the Details button reveals the following message:

   VFP caused an invalid page fault in module <unknown> at <memory
   address>.

 - In Windows 95 and in Windows 98, using Visual FoxPro 6.0, the following error
   appears:

   This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.

   Clicking the Details button reveals the following message:

   VFP caused an invalid page fault in module KERNEL32.DLL at <memory
   address>.

 - In Windows NT 4.0, using Visual FoxPro 5.0x, the following error appears:

   An application error has occurred and an application error log is being
   generated.

   VFP.exe
   Exception: access violation <error number>, Address: <memory
   address>.

 - In Windows NT 4.0, using Visual FoxPro 6.0, the problem does not occur.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

WARNING: The following steps cause Visual FoxPro to crash and you may not be able
to restart Visual FoxPro unless you turn your computer off and on (perform a
cold boot).

Visual FoxPro, however it is used here because it is the easiest way to
demonstrate the problem.

   READ EVENTS

2. Save and run the program.

3. Try to quit Visual FoxPro, by closing the Visual FoxPro window.

4. The following error displays in a dialog box, which contains an OK button:

   Cannot Quit Visual FoxPro.

5. Do NOT select the OK button and keep the error dialog box on the screen.

6. Invoke the Windows Task Manager and select the End Task button.

   NOTE: You may need to select End Task more than once.

7. One of the error messages listed in the SYMPTOMS section occurs.
