TITLE   :Rpcss.exe Consumes 100% CPU Due to RPC Spoofing Attack
PRODUCT :Microsoft Windows NT
PROD/VER:WinNT:4.0
OPER/SYS:
KEYWORDS:kbWinNT400sp4fix

======================================================================
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
 - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

System and network performance could degrade and the Rpcss.exe process could
consume 100 percent of CPU time. Analyzing the network with a protocol analyzer
shows multiple RPC REJECT packets (addressed to UDP port 135) between two or
more systems because of an RPC spoofing attack.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by a malicious attack on the remote procedure call (RPC)
components in Windows NT.

A UDP packet with a destination port of 135 can be spoofed so that it appears as
if one datagram RPC server sent bad data to another datagram RPC server. The
second server returns a REJECT packet. The first server replies with another
REJECT packet creating a loop that is not broken until a packet is dropped. If
this spoofed UDP packet is sent to multiple computers, an infinite loop may be
created, consuming processor resources and network bandwidth.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT version
4.0. For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
