The information in this article applies to:

 - Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use Microsoft Access as a data source in MS Query (Microsoft
Query), you may receive the following error message:

   Word was unable to open the data source.

NOTE: This problem may occur when you use either a Microsoft Access query or
table.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when Word generates an SQL string longer than 255
characters.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, either limit your query (Method 1) or don't use MS
Query (Method 2).

Method 1: Limit Your Query
--------------------------

To use Microsoft Access as a data source in Word, follow these steps:

1. Click OK to the error message "Word was unable to open the data source."

2. If you are using a Microsoft Access database as a data source in a Word mail
   merge, in the Mail Merge Helper (on the Tools menu, click Mail Merge), click
   Get Data, and then click Open Data Source. -or- If you are inserting a
   database in a Word document, in the Database dialog box (on the Database
   toolbar, click Insert Database), click Get Data. NOTE: To access the Database
   toolbar, on the View menu, point to Toolbars, and then click Database.

3. In the Open Data Source dialog box, click MS Query.

4. In the Choose Data Source dialog box, select "MS Access 97 Database," and
   then click OK. NOTE: Make sure the "Use the Query Wizard to create/edit
   queries" check box is selected. This check box is selected by default.

5. In the Select Database dialog box, select the Microsoft Access database file
   that you want to use, and then click OK.

6. In the "Query Wizard - Choose Columns" dialog box, in the "Available tables
   and columns" list, expand the table or query that you want use. Then select
   and add just the columns that you want to include in your query.

7. In the "Query Wizard - Filter Data" dialog box, filter the data to specify
   which rows to include in your query. If you don't want to filter the data,
   click Next.

8. In the "Query Wizard - Sort Order" dialog box, specify how you want your data
   sorted. If you don't want to sort the data, click Next.

9. In the "Query Wizard - Finish" dialog box, select what you would like to do.
   Click Save Query to run the query and add this query to the list of available
   queries. Use this list when you choose a query to run from Microsoft Excel or
   Microsoft Query or when you choose a data source. Saves the query's design as
   the file type *.dqy. -or- Click "Return Data to Microsoft Word," and then
   click Finish to run the query and to return the query results to Microsoft
   Word. -or- Click "View data or edit query in Microsoft Query," and then click
   Finish to run the query and to return the query results to Microsoft Query.
   You can view the data and make additional changes to your query in Microsoft
   Query before returning the data to Microsoft Word.

10. Word returns the results of your Microsoft Access query to your Word
   document. If you are using mail merge, Word prompts you with the following
   message: Word found no merge fields in your main document. Choose the Edit
   Main Document button to insert merge fields into your main document. Click
   Edit Main Document and continue your mail merge as usual. -or- If you are
   inserting database information, in the Database dialog box, click Insert
   Data. In the Insert Data dialog box, select either All to insert all of the
   results of the Microsoft Access query into your Word document or select From
   and specify which records you want to insert into your Word document. NOTE:
   In the Insert Data dialog box, the "Insert data as field" is not selected by
   default. If selected, this option inserts the data into the table as a
   field. Select this check box if you want to update the data in your Word
   document whenever the data source changes.
