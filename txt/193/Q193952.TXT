-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Using Visual FoxPro sometimes results in completely unexpected or unexplainable
results, problems, or errors. In such situations, you need a general method or
process of trial and error troubleshooting techniques. The steps in the MORE
INFORMATION section provide beginning steps for the troubleshooting process. The
steps also apply to the distributed application .exe's written in Visual FoxPro
that you install on client computers.

The first step is to make sure that you have an error free installation of the
Visual FoxPro product. To upgrade your installation of Visual FoxPro, you must
first remove any prior version of Visual FoxPro that you have on your computer.
Then, you can use the upgrade package to install the newer version of the Visual
FoxPro product.

In our experience, if you install the most recent version over the previous
version, the installation does not complete properly or reliably. This is
because all of the files may not update or install correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. If Visual FoxPro is installed on local computers use the following steps:

   a. Backup your files. Save any files on the computer that you want to keep;
      especially database (.dbc/.dct/.dcx) files and table (.dbf/.fpt/.cdx)
      files, as well as other source files such as .pjx, .pjt, .vcx,.vct,
      .scx,.sct, .mnx .mnt, .frx .frt, and the Config.fpw file.

   b. Remove Visual FoxPro completely, and then delete the directory in which it
      was installed.

      NOTE: This step is not necessary if you are in Step 3. You need to install
      into a completely new subdirectory.

   c. Close all open or running applications.

      1. Using CTRL+ALT+DELETE opens the system Task Manager allowing you to see
         what applications are currently running.

         NOTE: Do not close Explorer since it is the desktop user interface.

   d. Perform operating system disk error checking, which error checks and
      attempts to fix any lost cluster problems on the hard drive that may
      exist.

      1. Double-click the My Computer icon.

      2. Single click and select each hard drive. For example, C:, D:, and so
         forth.

      3. Using the right mouse button (right-click) and then select Properties.

      4. In the Properties dialog box, click the Tools tab.

      5. Click the Check Now Command button.

      6. In the Check Disk dialog box, select the "Automatically fix errors"
         check box.

      7. Select Thorough - Type of test option button.

      8. Click the Start button.

         NOTE: You may have to restart to run test.

      9. After running ScanDisk or the disk verification and fix for each local
         hard drive, shut down the computer and restart the system.

      10. You may want to run a hard drive disk optimization utility.

2. Once again, close all open or running applications, (See step 1c).

3. Install Visual FoxPro into a new or different directory location.

   a. A successful product installation means that you do not receive any errors
      during the installation. Errors during installation indicate an unreliable
      installation of Visual FoxPro. If errors occur:

      1. Note any errors during installation process.

      2. Remove any environment or system drivers that do not ship with the
         original operating system installation, including drivers for video,
         printers, mouse, CD-ROM, SCSI, and so forth.

      3. Rename the startup system files to ensure that other possible drivers
         or configuration parameters are not interfering. Rename the
         C:\Autoexec.bat file to C:\Autoexec.old and rename The C:\Config.sys
         file to C:\Config.old, and then restart the system.

      4. Start at Step 1 again.

NOTE: If this is your second time through this process, try using the Custom,
Minimal or Laptop installation, instead of Complete.

4. If Visual FoxPro is installed on network server:

   a. You must have an error free installation of Visual FoxPro.

   b. Generally, you cannot perform ScanDisk or other disk integrity checking
      while a Local Area Network (LAN) or Server is running.

   c. Remove and reinstall Visual FoxPro until no installation errors are
      received.

5. Eliminate all DUPLICATE source code and project files.

   This includes both network and local drives.

   a. Duplicate files cause multiple problems. Make sure that you retain the
      correct version of the source or project file, and ONLY the correct one.

6. If your project contains a DATABASE/DBC, VALIDATE the database.

   NOTE: Please refer to the OPEN DATABASE command in the Visual FoxPro Help file
   for details.
   a. Use the OPEN DATABASE <dbcname> EXCLUSIVE VALIDATE command.

      Errors indicate table (.dbf) or index (.cdx) corruption.

7. Clean up the project.

   Open your project and then from the Project menu, choose "Clean Up Project".

   Errors indicate project (.pjx) file corruption.

8. As a way to test with a different file, USE the file as you would a table
   (.dbf), copy the .dbf structure to a new file, and append the records from
   the original table, and rename the files. This method necessitates the
   creation of a new index (.cdx) file, if needed.

   NOTE: The following steps use a sample table (.dbf) file named Customer.dbf.

   Database, Project, Screen, Menu, Report, and Label files are actually Table
   (.dbf) files that have a different extension other than .dbf.

   If your file is open in the Visual FoxPro interactive or design environment,
   close it.

   Issue the following commands in the Visual FoxPro Command window:

   

         USE customer.dbf  && Must specify extension if other than .dbf.
         ? RECCOUNT()      && Note the number of records in the table.
         COPY STRUCTURE to newfile.dbf
         USE newfile.dbf   && Empty file structure without records.
         APPEND FROM customer.dbf  && Bring in records from original table.
         ? RECCOUNT()      && Compare number of records with original file.
         RENAME customer.dbf to oldcust.dbf
         RENAME newfile.dbf to customer.dbf

   Note a difference in the number of records in the new file as compared to the
   original file. This is an indicator that file corruption exists in the
   original file.

9. Test on a different computer or in a different computer environment such as a
   single user environment if problems occur in a multiuser environment or use a
   different Operating System.

10. If corrupt, the FoxPro resource file may cause problems.

   One way to test whether the resource file is a factor is to replace the file.
   Here are two ways to determine the name and location of the FoxPro resource
   file:

   a. You can determine the location of the currently active resource file by
      using the following FoxPro command:

   

               ?SYS(2005)

   b. You can specify the FoxPro resource file in the FoxPro configuration file,
      named Config.fpw by default. If the resource file specified by the
      configuration file does not exist, FoxPro creates one.

      1. Use the following FoxPro command to determine the location of the
         configuration file:

   

                    ?SYS(2019)

      2. The configuration file is an ASCII text file, which can be edited with
         any editor that saves it in ASCII text format. The easiest way to edit
         the currently active FoxPro configuration file is with the following
         command:

   

                     MODIFY FILE SYS(2019)

      3. The configuration file may contain a line of text that specifies the
         location and name of the resource file, such as follows:

   

                    RESOURCE=<path>\foxuser.dbf

         If so, comment that line out by placing an asterisk (*) at the beginning
         of the line.

      4. Add a new line such as the following:

   

                    RESOURCE=<path>\newjunk.dbf  && Any name of your choice.

      5. Restart FoxPro for the new setting to take effect.

11. Create a log file that contains the results of the preceding steps for
   future reference.
