Question:

When I invoke the QuickC integrated environment, a dialog box comes up
with the following message:

   QC is already running
           Exit?

The online help states that this message indicates another instance of
QuickC running on my system. However, I am sure that I do not have
another instance of QuickC running. I have rebooted and the message
still appears. How can I eliminate this dialog box?

Response:

This message is caused by the presence of the file QC.LCK, which is
created when the QuickC environment is invoked. If you shell out to
DOS during a QuickC session by choosing DOS Shell from the File menu,
and then attempt to start another QuickC session by typing "qc" at the
DOS prompt, you will receive this message. The file QC.LCK is
automatically deleted when you exit the QuickC environment.

However, if your system has crashed for some reason during a QuickC
editing session, or during the execution of a program from within the
QuickC environment, the file is not deleted, and when you reboot and
attempt to start QuickC, the presence of QC.LCK causes this message
box to appear.

The solution to this problem is to delete the QC.LCK file; it is
placed in the BIN subdirectory.
