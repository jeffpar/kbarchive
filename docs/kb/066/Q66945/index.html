SYMPTOMS
========

After an implicitly loaded dynamic-link library (DLL) attempts to create a
window in its initialization procedure, a Fatal Exit 0x0019 occurs.

CAUSE
=====

When an application is loaded, Windows loads any DLLs that are implicitly
referenced by that application prior to initializing the application's task.
Part of task initialization is creating a message queue for that application. By
the time the application's WinMain() function is called, the message queue has
been created.

Any window created by a DLL uses the message queue of the application task using
that DLL. If an implicitly loaded DLL creates a window in its initialization
code (that is, LibMain) there is no message queue for it to use. When Windows
detects this situation, it signals Fatal Exit 0x0019.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the DLL must display a message during initialization, it must either be
explicitly loaded from the application using LoadLibrary() or the DLL should
export a function that can be called from the WinMain() procedure of the
application. By the time WinMain() is executed, the window queue has been
created.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Microsoft Windows, a network driver is the only DLL that can create a window
during initialization. The network driver is loaded after the first application
task has been initialized (that is, the shell), and any dialog box displayed by
a network driver uses the message queue of the shell application.
