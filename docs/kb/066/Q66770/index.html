Product Assistance Checklist
----------------------------

This checklist is designed to assist you when you need help with a
Microsoft product. Before you call Microsoft, please gather all
information that applies to your problem. So that we can assist you as
quickly as possible, note any on-screen messages that appear when the
problem occurs. Have your manuals and product disks close at hand and
have all the information requested on this form available when you
call.

Diagnosing the Problem
----------------------

Many common problems are related to how the system's environment is
set up.

Under MS-DOS, to ensure that your system is using the utilities and
programs that came with your Microsoft product, check your system's
path and directory structure. Pay particular attention to device
drivers loaded in your CONFIG.SYS file and any programs that you load
from your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, such as TSR (terminate and stay resident)
utilities. You can rename these system configuration files and restart
your system to determine if the contents of these files are related to
your problem.

Under Apple Macintosh systems, you may need to remove INIT files or
other memory-resident programs from the System Folder; then restart the
Macintosh to determine if a conflict is occurring.

Please be prepared to answer the following questions regarding your
problem, your hardware, and your software.

General Information
-------------------

1. What product and version number are you using?

2. Can you reproduce the problem?

3. Does the problem occur with another copy of the original disk of
   your Microsoft software?

4. Does the problem occur on another computer system, if available?

5. If you are running any other software at the same time, such as a
   windowing environment or memory-resident utility, does the problem
   still occur when you don't use the other software?

Software
--------

1. Operating system name and version. (You can determine the version
   by typing the VER command at the MS DOS or OS/2 prompt. On Apple
   Macintosh systems, select "About the Finder" from the Apple menu.)

2. Network software? Does the problem still occur without the network
   loaded?

3. Microsoft Windows, or other windowing environment, and version?

4. Other software loaded (keyboard enhancers, print spoolers, etc.)?

Hardware
--------

1. Computer manufacturer and model.

2. Memory configuration.

3. Video graphics adapter and display manufacturer and model.

4. Other boards and peripherals (mouse, printer, network interface,
   etc.).
