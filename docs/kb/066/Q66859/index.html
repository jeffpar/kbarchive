SUMMARY
=======

Cruel is a solitaire card game included in the Microsoft Windows Entertainment
Pack. The playing area is divided into three regions: four suit stacks are
located at the top of the playing area; 12 stacks of cards are located below;
and the Deal button is located in the upper-right hand corner of the playing
area. The object of Cruel is to move all the cards from the lower stacks up to
the suit stacks.

MORE INFORMATION
================

At the beginning of each game, there are four Aces in the suit stacks. The
remaining 48 cards are randomly distributed in the 12 stacks below, with each
stack containing exactly four cards.

You can move the top card in a stack up to the corresponding suit stack, provided
it is one higher in rank. For example, you can move the 5 of Spades from one of
the 12 lower stacks onto the 4 of Spades in a suit stack.

You can move the top card in a stack to another stack, provided it follows the
same suit and is one lower in rank. For example, you can move the 4 of Hearts in
one of the lower stacks to the 5 of Hearts in another lower stack.

If you are unable to figure out any more moves, click the Deal button and redeal.
Redealing simply rearranges the cards in the 12 lower stacks, keeping four cards
in each stack without changing the consecutive order of any cards. For example,
if you move cards from one stack to another so that the 3, 4, and 5 of Diamonds
are together, a redeal will keep this order intact. If you have not moved any
cards since the last deal, clicking the Deal button has no effect.

The game is over when all the cards have been moved up to the suit stacks or when
no cards can be moved from the stacks after a redeal.
