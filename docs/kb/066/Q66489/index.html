BB0353: "Learn BASIC Now" Reply Letter
--------------------------------------

Dear "Learn BASIC Now" Customer:

Thank you for your letter concerning Microsoft Press's "Learn BASIC
Now."

"Learn BASIC Now," a Microsoft Press release, is a self-study tutorial
sold through Microsoft Press. To make "Learn BASIC Now" more
competitive in the marketplace, the product does not have support
costs built into the retail price. Therefore, Microsoft is providing a
900-number support service. Other sources of support include your
Microsoft Press documentation or using your online help F1 key (if
possible).

Microsoft is providing support for "Learn BASIC Now" through a new
service called "OnCall(TM) for BASIC." To access "OnCall for BASIC," call
(900) 896-9999. The cost is $2 per minute, and the service is
available Monday through Friday from 8 AM to 5 PM Pacific Standard
Time. To obtain the best possible service, we recommend you have your
Microsoft Press "Learn BASIC Now" reference manual and disks handy
when you call.

We welcome your letters containing product suggestions and feedback on
documentation. Although we are unable to respond to your technical
questions by letter, we do forward your letters to the "Learn BASIC
Now" development team. There are many supplemental sources of
information relating to the BASIC languages, including reference
guides and books published by Microsoft Press, or you can call our
"OnCall for BASIC" service at (900) 896-9999.

Support is also available electronically through Microsoft OnLine and
CompuServe. One of the features of these services is to provide access
to the Microsoft Knowledge Base. The Microsoft Knowledge Base contains
the latest technical information about Microsoft language products.
For more information about Microsoft OnLine, which is designed for
software developers, call (800) 443-4672. For more information about
CompuServe, which is the largest general online information service
for personal computer users, call (800) 848-8199.

Thank you for supporting Microsoft Press's "Learn BASIC Now."

Sincerely,

Blain Barton
