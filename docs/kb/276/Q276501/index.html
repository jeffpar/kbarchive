The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

PageOf.exe contains a sample Visual FoxPro report that sets a "page # of #"
counter. To generate the counter, the report dynamically calculates how many
lines are used on the detail line to accommodate the fields. The records on the
table are divided by the amount of detail lines and then used to generate the
counter.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. After it is posted, the file is housed on
secure servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

The PageOf.exe file contains the following files:

+---------------------+
| File name    | Size | 
+---------------------+
| PageOf.frx   | 7KB  | 
+---------------------+
| PageOf.frt   | 4KB  | 
+---------------------+
| Employee.dbf | 5KB  | 
+---------------------+

To use the sample, perform the following steps:

1. Download and save files.

2. Start Visual FoxPro.

3. From the Command window type:

  REPORT FORM PAGEOF PREVIEW

4. Note the "Page 1 of 3" page footer. To see how the sample works, drag the
  detail down to expand the detail area; this causes fewer records per page and
  thereby increases the number of pages. You can also expand the header and
  footer sections of the report, and it automatically performs the
  calculations.

The core of the calculations are contained in two report variables called
nLineCount and nLineCalc. The report also uses the Init event of the cursor in
the Data Environment to save how many records are in the table. You need to
adjust the code according to whether or not your table is going to hold deleted
records. Here are two code samples that illustrate these two scenarios:

  *!* Init Event Code to exclude deleted records.
  Public nRecNo
  SET DELETED ON
  COUNT ALL FOR !DELETED() TO nRecNo

-or-

  *!* Init Event Code for all records.
  nRecNo = RECCOUNT()

This sample has limited functionality, and does not function correctly with data
grouping or memo fields that stretch with overflow. Data grouping and memo
fields that stretch with overflow cause an inconsistent detail line length,
thereby affecting the calculations.
