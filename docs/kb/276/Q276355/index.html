MORE INFORMATION
================

Pages 50 and 147: Incorrect Information About Maximum Number Of Storage Groups Allowed
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pages 50 and 147 state that "Each Exchange server can have up to 16 storage
groups, and each storage group can have up to 6 databases."

Although the Extensible Storage Engine (ESE) code allows 16 storage groups,
Exchange 2000 Server only allows a maximum of 4 storage groups containing a
maximum of 5 databases for each storage group. This limit is enforced inside the
Exchange System Manager snap-in, so administrators cannot create more storage
groups than the system allows.

For more information, please read the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
article:

Q251123: Maximum Number of Storage Groups in Exchange 2000 for Database Capacity
Planning


Page 79: Correction To Allowing Others To Access A Mailbox
----------------------------------------------------------

On page 79, under "Allowing Others to Access a Mailbox", the steps listed for
granting access to a mailbox are incorrect. Please replace the 3 steps with the
following:

1. Start the Active Directory Users and Computers MMC snap-in.

2. On the View menu, make sure that a check mark appears next to the Advanced
Features command.

3. Locate the Organizational Unit that contains the user who owns the mailbox
that you want to allow other users to view.

4. Right-click the user that owns the mailbox, and then click Properties.

5. On the Exchange Advanced tab, click Mailbox Rights.

6. Click Add.

7. Select the user or users that you want to allow to use the mailbox, and then
assign them Full Mailbox Access - Allow permission.


Page 213: Backing Up Exchange Server M Drive Not Recommended
------------------------------------------------------------

On page 213, the first bulleted item in step 4 reads:

"To back up Exchange and Windows 2000 settings, select all hard disk drives where
Windows 2000 and Exchange 2000 Server are installed. Normally, this means
backing up the root drive C:\ and the special partition for Exchange Server,
M:Exchange."

Microsoft does not recommend backing up drive M with file-level backup software.
