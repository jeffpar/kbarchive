-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you open an SNA configuration file that was created with Host Integration
Server 2000 (HIS 2000) by using the SNA 4.0 Manager, you may receive the
following error:

  SNAOLE: Internal: Invalid Record

CAUSE
=====

Before Host Integration Server 2000 was released, the format of the
configuration file was uncertain. Because of changes internally in the Com.cfg
file, SNA Server 4.0 reports errors when it tries to read configuration data
that is related to shared folders or printers.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been corrected so that SNA 4.0 cannot open a Com.cfg file that
is created by HIS 2000.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server, versions
4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3.

This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4.

Additional query words: Snacfg sp1 sp2 sp3
