SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the attributes that cannot be pushed out to Microsoft
Windows NT 4.0 by means of the Windows NT Management Agent (MA).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following attributes and their values may be populated in an export file,
but they are not updated in the connected directory:

- user_id: It can specify a number that contains the relative ID (the Routing
  Information Daemon or RID) of the user. The RID is determined by the Security
  Account Manager (SAM) when the user is created. It uniquely defines the user
  account to SAM in the domain. Any values that are set in an export file are
  ignored.

- primary_group_id: It has a number value that contains the RID of the Primary
  Global group for the user. Do not set this attribute on new object creations.
  When you modify the user's settings, this member must be the RID of the
  Global group in which the user is enrolled. Any values that are set in the
  export file are ignored.

- profile: It has a string that specifies a path to the user's profile. This
  value can be a local absolute path, or a universal naming convention (UNC)
  path. Any values that are set in the export file are ignored.

- Home_dir_drive: It has a string that specifies the drive letter assigned to
  the user's home directory for logon purposes. Any values that are set in the
  export file are ignored.

- password_expired: It can specify if a user must change a password at the next
  logon session. Microsoft Metadirectory Services (MMS) version 2.1 does not
  set this attribute.

NOTE: The Cdir_nt program in MMS 2.1 is not designed to manage the preceding
Windows NT attributes. A limitation of the MMS 2.1 Cdir_nt.exe program is its
inability to support sending the preceding attributes out to the connected
directory as values in either new or pre-existing objects.
