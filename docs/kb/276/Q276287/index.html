-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Visual FoxPro offers a level of backward compatibility with files from Dbase. In
some cases, you might find that Dbase Format (.fmt) files behave erratically by
scrolling to the end the table, as if the Page Down key is being pressed.

CAUSE
=====

Visual FoxPro uses Event Model rather than Foundation READ.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two recommended workarounds:

- The first method is to recreate the format files as native Visual FoxPro
  forms.

- The second method requires modifications to the format files. The following
  code is generated when you create a format file in Dbase, and it varies
  depending on how the format file was originally designed. To demonstrate this
  workaround, perform the following steps:

  1. Paste the following code into a program or text file, and save it as
     Empform.fmt:

  *-- Format file initialization code --------------------------------------------

  IF SET("TALK")="ON"
     SET TALK OFF
     lc_talk="ON"
  ELSE
     lc_talk="OFF"
  ENDIF

  *-- This form was created in EGA25 mode
  SET DISPLAY TO EGA25

  lc_status=SET("STATUS")
  *-- SET STATUS was ON when you went into the Forms Designer.
  IF lc_status = "OFF"
     SET STATUS ON
  ENDIF

  *-- @ SAY GETS Processing. --------------------------

  *!* MODIFICATION (1 of 2)
  *!* Set a procedure call to assign keys
  *!* functionality to the PageUp, PageDown and Escape Keys. 
  SET PROCEDURE TO SetKey 
  KeyInit()	&amp;&amp;Initializes the keys
  *!* 

  *--  Format Page: 1
  @ 1,0 SAY "EMP_ID" 
  @ 1,12 GET emp_id PICTURE "XXXXXX" 
  @ 2,0 SAY "LAST_NAME" 
  @ 2,12 GET lname PICTURE "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" 
  @ 3,0 SAY "FIRST_NAME" 
  @ 3,12 GET fname PICTURE "XXXXXXXXXX" 
  @ 6,0 SAY "HIRE_DATE" 
  @ 6,12 GET hire_date 
  *-- Format file exit code ---------------------------

  *!* MODIFICATION (2 of 2)
  *!* Establish the READ command to loop around the fields.
  READ CYCLE 
  *!*

  *-- SET STATUS was ON when you went into the Forms Designer.
  IF lc_status = "OFF"  &amp;&amp; Entered form with status off
     SET STATUS OFF     &amp;&amp; Turn STATUS "OFF" on the way out
  ENDIF

  IF lc_talk="ON"
     SET TALK ON
  ENDIF

  RELEASE lc_talk,lc_fields,lc_status
  *-- EOP: EMPFORM.FMT

  2. Paste the following code into a program or text file, and save it as
     Setkey.prg:

  FUNCTION KeyInit
  	ON KEY LABEL PgUp PageUp()
  	ON KEY LABEL PgDn PageDown()
  	ON KEY LABEL Esc EscFunc()
  ENDFUNC

  FUNCTION PageUp
  IF !BOF()
  	SKIP -1
  	SHOW GETS
  ELSE
  	GO TOP
  ENDIF
  ENDFUNC

  FUNCTION PageDown
  SKIP
  IF EOF()
  	GO BOTTOM
  ENDIF
  SHOW GETS
  ENDFUNC

  FUNCTION EscFunc
  	ON KEY LABEL PgUp 
  	ON KEY LABEL PgDn 
  	ON KEY LABEL Esc
  	SET STATUS BAR ON
  	CLEAR
  	CANCEL
  ENDFUNC

  3. Paste this code into a program or text file, and save it as Main.prg:

  *!*	Creates a sample table
  CREATE TABLE emp_table (emp_id c(9),fname c(20),lname c(30),hire_date T(8))

  *!*	Inserts sample records.
  INSERT INTO emp_table (emp_id,fname,lname,hire_date);
  	VALUES ('234234325','George','Washington',{^2000/07/01 12:35pm})

  INSERT INTO emp_table (emp_id,fname,lname,hire_date);
  	VALUES ('456432734','Albert','Einstein',{^2000/08/23 4:40pm})

  INSERT INTO emp_table (emp_id, fname,lname,hire_date);
  	VALUES ('566753444','Amelia','Earhart',{^2000/10/15 8:00am})

  GO TOP

  *!*	Executes the Format File instead of using the SET FORMAT command.
  DO empform.fmt &amp;&amp;Calls the Format File
  USE

  4. Run the program from Visual FoxPro by typing DO MAIN from the Command
     window and pressing ENTER.

This workaround basically traps for keys like PageUp, PageDown and Escape keys,
and assigns specific actions that are defined in Setkey.prg. It uses a READ
CYCLE to prevent the records from scrolling abnormally.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start Visual FoxPro.

2. Change directory to where your format (.fmt) file is located.

3. Type the following lines and press ENTER after each one:

  USE EMP_table
  SET FORMAT TO empform.fmt 
  EDIT

4. Note the behavior at this point.
