SUMMARY
=======

SNA Server does not send the logical unit (LU name) as configured in SNA Server
Manager to the host as part of the Network Management Vector Table (NMVT)
request when activating or deactivating Dynamic Definition for Dependent LUs
(DDDLU). By default, the LU that is dynamically defined on the mainframe uses a
name that is specified in the LUSEED parameter in the physical unit (PU)
definition in the Virtual Telecommunication Access Method (VTAM).

Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

An update from IBM allows a LU name to be passed in a new NMVT subvector so that
the dynamically created LU is created with the LU name that is passed in the
NMVT request that causes the LU to be created.


SNA Server has been updated to send the LU name in the NMVT request for DDDLUs so
that the dynamically created LUs are created using the LU name that is defined
in SNA Server Manager. This fix was first included in SNA Server 4.0 Service
Pack 4.
