-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to branch a shared file you get the following error message:

  A more recent version is checked out.

CAUSE
=====

This error is seen when both of the following conditions are true:

- The file you are trying to branch is pinned at a previous version.
- The file it is shared with is currently checked out.

SourceSafe doesn't let you branch the file at a previous version while a more
recent version is checked out.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, see the following:

- Check the shared file back in.
- Perform the branch from the command line.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Share "$/Project1/file1" in SourceSafe to a new location, "$/Project2/file1".

2. Pin "$/Project2/file1" at current version.

3. Check out "$/Project1/file1" and make a change.

4. Check "$/Project1/file1" back in.

5. Check "$/Project1/file1" back out again.

6. Branch "$/Project2/file1".
