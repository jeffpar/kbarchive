-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
- Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0 Option Pack 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you disable the Protected Storage service on a computer running Windows NT
4.0 Service Pack 3 or Service Pack 4, and then restart the computer, the
Microsoft Message Queue Server Independent Client (MSMQ IC) program may not
start automatically.

If you install an application that delays the startup of the Protected Storage
service (for example Microsoft SQL Server 7.0), and then restart the computer,
the MSMQ IC does not automatically start and an Event Viewer System log entry is
generated.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Microsoft CryptoAPI needs the Protected Storage
service.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT Server or Workstation 4.0
------------------------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or the
individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
pack, please go to:

- http://www.microsoft.com/Windows/ServicePacks/

-or-

- Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack

For information on obtaining the individual software update, contact Microsoft
Product Support Services. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support
Services phone numbers and information on support costs, please go to the
following address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS


To resolve this issue, when a program is delaying the start of the Protected
Storage service, you may be able to manually start MSMQ IC since the Protected
Storage service was only delayed by the program and not disabled. To do this,
follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
  Services.

2. Click Protected Storage, and then click Start.

Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
----------------------------------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition.

This problem was first corrected in Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6 and
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the MSMQ IC does not start because of an application that delays the
startup of the Protected Storage service, two entries may be placed in the Event
Viewer System log by the Service Control Manager (SCM):

   - Timeout (120000 milliseconds) waiting for the service to connect
  .

- The Microsoft Message Queue Server service failed to start due to the
  following error: The service did not respond to the start or control request
  in a timely fashion.

Two events may also be placed in the Event Viewer Application log:

   - Application error ID 2036 is logged to Windows NT showing "MQIS database
  initialization error."

- Application event ID 2063 is then logged "Initialization completed with
  errors. The MSMQ service is partially functional."

This problem has been corrected in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6 by specifying in
the registry that the MSMQ IC is dependent on the Protected Storage service.
Even if the Protected Storage service is otherwise disabled or delayed, the MSMQ
IC can force it to start.

4.0 services, please visit the following Microsoft Web site:
