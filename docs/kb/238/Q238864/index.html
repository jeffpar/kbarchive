-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
- Microsoft Windows 98 
- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Systems Management Server Service Pack 1 (SP1) to a site with
Windows 95 or Windows 98 clients, the client computers may stop responding
(hang) at logon or during normal use. Note that this behavior is more noticeable
with the Windows 95 client computers.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because the Systems Management Server client upgrade is
unable to replace files in use on the Windows 98/95 client computers. Because of
this, you may need to restart the client computer multiple times to upgrade
successfully, and if you restart too soon after logon, the upgrade may not be
successful.

This problem can also occur if the client computer has upgraded core components
but is running pre-SP1 optional components. When this occurs, the client
computer may stop responding or generate an application exception error in one
or more components, including but not limited to the Smsmon32.exe file of the
Clisvc95.exe file.

NOTE: This may happen if the Logon Point server is upgraded but the client CAP
server is not upgraded to SP1. For additional information, please click the

  Q236596 SMS: Client Components Fail to Install with SMS 2.0 SP1

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, manually uninstall and then reinstall the client.

To prevent this problem from occurring, verify that your Windows 98/95 clients
are uninstalled before applying the service pack. You can uninstall clients by
using either of the following methods:

Method 1
--------

Disable the Windows NT Logon Installation Method and then run the 20clicln.bat
file or use the Smsman command with the /u parameter, for example "smsman /u"
(without the quotation marks).

Method 2
--------

To uninstall without any manual intervention:

1. Remove the IP subnets from the site boundaries but leave the Windows
  Networking Logon Installation Method enabled.

  NOTE: If large numbers of Windows 98/95 client computers are currently
  affected by this problem, it is recommended to leave Windows NT Logon
  Installation Method enabled and remove the subnet boundaries for 2 or more
  days so clients can completely uninstall. The number of days needed depends
  on the number of remote users and the probability of computers being missed
  because they are not currently running. When the boundaries are removed, it
  is also recommended to ask your user community to shut down their machines at
  night until the majority of clients are uninstalled. Also, to determine the
  client's exact state, client computers should be restarted 1-3 times before
  reinstalling the SP1 SMS client software.

2. After the clients are uninstalled, upgrade the site, permit all site
  computers to be upgraded automatically, and then 2 subnet boundaries can be
  added back (one at a time). After you do so, the clients should be properly
  reinstalled.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine the exact uninstallation state and if there are problem client
computers remaining:

1. Run the Status Message Queries for "Clients that failed to uninstall
  &lt;component name&gt;" where &lt;component name&gt; is the name of the
  individual component:

  a. Start the SMS Administration console, and then expand the System Status
     branch to view the Status Message Queries node.

  b. Right-click the query, and then click Show Messages.

  c. Click Specify, and then type the site code.

  d. Click "Select Date and Time", and then click a date at least 2 weeks ago.
     Note that you may have to make it longer than 2 weeks, depending on when
     clients were removed from the boundaries.

2. View the list to find the client computers, and then determine what their
  current state is by viewing the Components tab in the Systems Management tool
  in Control Panel.

3. Run the Status Message Query to look for clients that uninstalled the base
  components, and then verify on a few computers that they are actually
  uninstalled.
