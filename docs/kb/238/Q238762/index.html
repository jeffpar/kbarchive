The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0

SUMMARY
=======

Systems Management Server (SMS) Resource Explorer may display a created date for
an inventoried file that is different from the created date listed in the file's
properties in Windows Explorer. This problem occurs for two reasons:

- The software inventory agent (sinv) did not use the file Creation Date as a
  key property. Therefore on a single client, files with the same name but with
  different created time stamps, were treated as the same and were not reported
  separately.

- The stored procedure (sp_SoftwareInventory) that inserts software inventory
  information into the SMS database also did not use Creation Date as a key
  property. As a result, the time stamp that became associated with the file
  was simply the time stamp of the last reported instance across all clients.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

Additional query words: prodsms sinv sinvproc
