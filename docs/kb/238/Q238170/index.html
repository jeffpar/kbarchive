SUMMARY
=======

This article contains some of the common terms used in a Lotus Notes environment
and explanations of those terms in relation to a Microsoft Outlook and Exchange
Server environment.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Workspace: The primary screen within the Lotus Notes environment. The workspace
contains icons, or pointers to all databases the client has connected to. The
layout of the workspace is saved in a file located in the Notes\Data\Desktop.dsk
file. There is no direct correlation between a workspace and an Outlook
environment.

Databases: In a Lotus Notes environment, all information is accessed through
different databases. Users have one database for mail, one that might contain a
discussion, or even team documents that everyone needs to access. In Outlook,
databases are similar to public folders.

Location Selector: The Lotus Notes client allows a user to work in a variety of
different "modes" or locations. You can specify whether you want to connect by
means of a LAN, a modem, or work offline. The user can change this configuration
at any time by changing his or her location. When connected by the LAN
connection, users can work with databases on either the local computer or on the
server. When users are working offline, they only have access to their local
databases. Each database on the workspace either says "database on local" or
"database on server."

Replication Tab: Lotus Notes is designed around database replication. Every user
has a page on his or her workspace called Replication, which is used for
configuring database replication. Options can be set for the frequency of
replication, the amount of data replicated, and even the direction of the
replication.

Name and Address Book: Lotus Notes keeps all configuration information including
people, servers, databases, and connections in a database called the Name and
Address Book. By default, the master Name and Address Book is called Names.nsf.
Much like an Exchange Server directory, the Name and Address Book is replicated
to all servers in a Lotus Notes organization.

Server Console: Exchange Server's core components (information store, directory,
MTA, system attendant) all run as services. In a Lotus Notes environment, the
server is run as a console window resembling an MS-DOS command prompt session.
Commands can be issued under this console to perform different functions such as
loading modules, showing statistics, or shutting down the server. The server
console is visible on the physical computer that is running the server or on a
client when you click on the File menu, click Tools, click Server
Administration, and click Console.

Access Control: Permissions for every Lotus Notes database are configured using
an Access Control List (ACL), which can be accessed by right-clicking on a
database and selecting Access Control.
