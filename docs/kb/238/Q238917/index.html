  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

A DHCP client may experience a delay obtaining an IP address from a DHCP server.

CAUSE
=====

When a client boots, it tries a renew process for the address that it previously
owned. If the client does not receive a response to its request for a renewal,
the DHCP client waits five minutes before attempting to renew the address.
However, the discover process is not affected by the new registry key described
later in this article.

RESOLUTION
==========

individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

A new registry parameter has been added so that the client does not wait for five
minutes before attempting to discover a new address. The process for obtaining
an address is clearly stated in RFC 1541.


1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Dhcp\Parameters

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

  Value Name: DhcpUseLargeNumberOfRequests
  Data Type: REG_DWORD
  Value: 1 (default is 0)

4. Quit Registry Editor.


Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
----------------------------------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
