-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Running Dcomcnfg.exe changes the services database for the process you are
running. After the services database is changed, the process is no longer able
to run on the computer. This occurs because the service no longer has "Logon as"
settings.

For example, if the service is set to log on as &lt;domain&gt;\&lt;account&gt; in
the Windows NT SCM database (configured by using the Services tool in Control
Panel), and you run Dcomcnfg.exe and change some settings for the service (such
as the launch permissions), Dcomcnfg.exe changes the service logon type back to
"System."

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
