  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to add a carriage return to the Legal Notice text in
Windows NT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can configure Windows NT to display a Legal Notice message to users before
they can log on to the system. At the end of the message, users must click OK
before the logon dialog box is displayed.

If the message contains more than one paragraph, you can add a carriage return so
that the message is displayed as intended (even if the display resolution on the
computer changes). For additional information about the Legal Notice banner in
Windows NT, please click the article number below to view the article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q101063 Windows Logon Welcome, Displaying Warning Message

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To add a carriage return to the Legal Notice text of a logon dialog box, follow
these steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon

3. Locate and double-click the LegalNoticeText value.

4. Type the text that you want displayed in the Legal Notice message, and then
  click OK.

5. On the Edit menu, click Binary. This opens the text of the message in the
  binary editor. Each letter of the message (including spaces) is represented
  in hexadecimal, with four characters in the binary editor representing one
  letter of text in the message.

6. To insert a carriage return after a line of text, click the space just after
  the last character in the message where you want to put the first carriage
  return, type "0D00" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.

7. Remember that one letter of normal text is equal to four characters in the
  binary editor. Count the number of characters before the next location where
  you want to put a carriage return, and multiply this by four. Move over this
  number of spaces in binary mode, and then type "0D00" (without the quotation
  marks) again.

8. Repeat this process for each carriage return that is needed. You can put two
  carriage returns next to each other to simulate a new paragraph.

NOTE: The Windows 2000 Registry Editor dialog box that is used for the Windows
2000 Legal Notice text (LegalNoticeText) does not recognize the character 0x0D.
Instead, you must insert both the carriage return (0x0D) and line feed (0x0A)
characters in that order, for example, "0D000A00" (without the quotation marks).
