The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Index Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a customer returns results from a query in Index Server, the URL to the
matching document may be missing the virtual path to the document.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when a physical directory in the Index Server snap-in for
the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) is added to the Directories folder
located under the catalog or by a backslash in the Scope variable in the code of
the query page.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the Index Server snap-in in the MMC, find the Directories folder that is a
subset of your catalog. In the list of directories, any directory there must
have an icon that has a folder with a globe on it. If it has a plain folder,
delete it from the list. You may want to rebuild the Index if you make changes
here (stop Index Server, delete or move the contents of the Catalog.wci
directory, and then restart Index Server). Index Server considers directories
that appear in this list with the plain folder icon as "physical" directories,
which means the results returned from those directories are not virtual paths
(vpaths), but physical paths. This may cause the vpath variable to be
unpopulated and links to documents to be missing from the results page.

Also, make sure that in the code for the query page, you have specified the
correct scope. In the default ASP file, find the following line and make sure it
appears the same:

  	Formscope="/"

In an IDQ file, make your CiScope line appears as follows:

  	CiScope=/ 

Make sure that you are using a forward slash (or forward slashes for a longer
path). If you use a back slash, your results will be physical, which may result
in missing vpaths.
