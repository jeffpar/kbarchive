-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The information store generates a non-delivery report (NDR) to an SMTP report
when an SMTP report is returned to a mailbox that meets all of the following
conditions:

- The mailbox size currently exceeds the set limit.

- The "Prohibit send and receive (K)" option is selected.

- The Internet Mail Service is on a server different from the mailbox.

This could cause a message loop as the report is addressed to a null (&lt;&gt;)
address, which means the Internet Mail Service cannot deliver the message. At
this point, the NDR is returned to the originator, which was the mailbox
currently unable to accept mail. This may generate yet another NDR, and the
whole process repeat itself.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
