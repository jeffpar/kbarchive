  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

For Outlook 98 and Outlook 2000, if you delete the Outlook icon from the
desktop, there is no interface to restore the icon back to the desktop. You
cannot recover the icon by right-clicking the desktop and using the Undo Delete
menu item.

For Outlook 97, the above is also true if you removed the Inbox icon from the
desktop and converted the Outlook shortcut to a permanent desktop icon using the
Chnginbx.exe utility from the Office 97 compact disc in the Valupack\Patch
folder or from the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/9798/chnginbx.aspx (
  http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/9798/chnginbx.aspx).

For additional information about the Chnginbx.exe utility, please click the

When you attempt to delete the Outlook icon from the desktop, a Confirm Delete
dialog box appears with one of the following messages:

  Are you sure you want to delete Microsoft Outlook from your desktop? After you
  remove this icon from your desktop you can still access the files in this

It is possible to restore the icon by adding a key in the Registry.

incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

  Key Name: {00020D75-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}

4. Quit Registry Editor.

You must refresh the desktop to see the restored Outlook icon. To do this:

1. Minimize all open windows.

2. With the left mouse button, click on the desktop.

3. Press F5 to refresh the desktop.
