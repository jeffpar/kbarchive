-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Asheron's Call, version 1.0 
- Microsoft Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you connect to the Internet from your local area network (LAN) using Network
Address Translation (NAT) or Internet Connection Sharing (ICS), only one
computer on the network may be able to play Microsoft Asheron's Call. You may
receive the following:

  The connection progress tubes at the beginning of the game may not fill.

  -or-

  While in the game, when an additional computer connects, the previous
  computer's server connection to Asheron's Call is lost.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the default network port setting in Asheron's
Call is not compatible with ICS or NAT.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, modify the network port setting in Asheron's Call on each
computer:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Microsoft Games, point to Asheron's
  Call, and then click Asheron's Call.

2. Click Settings.

3. For "Port number to use", select "Derived from your IP address" or
  "Automatically detect my port for me", depending on whether you have
  Asheron's Call 1.0 or Dark Majesty installed.

4. Click OK, and then click Exit.

If this fails, to resolve the issue:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Microsoft Games, point to Asheron's
  Call, and then click Asheron's Call.

2. Click Settings.

3. For Specific Port, type in a different port number for each computer
  attempting to connect. For example, 9000 on one computer and 9004 on another.

4. Click OK, and then click Exit.

If this fails, to resolve the issue:

When playing Asheron's Call, have each computer join a different Asheron's Call
world. You may also be successful in playing on the same world if your
characters are extremely far apart on that world.

NOTE: For Asheron's Call, version 1.0 the network port settings may not be save
correctly on Windows 2000 or Windows XP.
