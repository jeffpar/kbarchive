SYMPTOMS
========

Instead of receiving a list of matching documents when you perform a query using
Microsoft Index Server, you may receive the following error message:

  No Documents Matched the Query

CAUSE
=====

This error is one of the most common errors that occurs when you try to query on
a catalog. This error means that the catalog is responding the way that it
should; however, there is an incorrect setting somewhere that is causing Index
Server to determine that it has no documents to return.

WORKAROUND
==========

To find the incorrect setting, use the following troubleshooting steps in the
order they are listed, and then test after each step:

1. In the Index Server snap-in in the MMC, right-click the name of the catalog
  you are working with, and then click Properties. In the Properties dialog,
  click the Web tab and make sure that Track Virtual Roots is enabled and that
  the correct site is selected on the drop-down menu. If you had the incorrect
  site selected, rebuild the catalog from scratch (stop Index Server, delete
  the contents of the Catalog.wci directory, and then restart Index Server).

2. In the Index Server snap-in, click the Directories folder that is a subset of
  your Catalog. In that list of directories, any directory listed there must
  have an icon that has a folder with a globe on it. If it has just a folder,
  delete it from the list. You may want to rebuild the Index if you make
  changes here. Index Server considers directories that appear in this list
  with just a folder icon as "physical" directories, which means results that
  are returned from those directories are not virtual paths (vpaths), but
  physical paths. This can cause the vpath variable to be unpopulated.

3. Try the samples in the \INETPUB\IISSAMPLES\ISSAMPLES directory. The only
  variable that may need to be changed is the pointer to the catalog, if you
  are not using the default catalog. In an IDQ you should see a line like the
  following:

  # CiCatalog=d:\inetpub\wwwroot\tmjs_index

  Remove the pound sign (#), as the pound sign comments it out, and make sure
  the path is pointing to the folder that contains your Catalog.wci. In an ASP,
  you will need to add the Q.Catalog line in the context below:

  set Q = Server.CreateObject("ixsso.Query")
          set util = Server.CreateObject("ixsso.Util")
      Q.Catalog="&lt;catalogname&gt;"
      Q.Query = CompSearch
      Q.SortBy = "rank[d]"
      Q.Columns = "DocTitle, vpath, filename, size, write, characterization, rank"
      Q.MaxRecords = 300 

  Where &lt;catalogname&gt; is the name of your catalog as it appears in the MMC
  for Index Server (with the quotation marks around it).

4. In the code of your page, make sure the following is true:

  In an IDQ:

  CiScope=/ 
  CiRestriction=%CiRestriction%
  CiCatalog=&lt;path to the directory holding the Catalog.wci folder&gt;

  In an ASP:

  FormScope=/ 
  Q.Query=compsearch
  Q.Catalog="&lt;catalogname&gt;"

  Where &lt;catalogname&gt; is the name of the catalog as it appears in the
  Index Server snap-in in the MMC.

  This will ensure that you are running the widest possible search with the most
  chances of returning results against the correct catalog, with nothing on the
  query line to prevent results from appearing. Note that this can be changed
  later.

5. In the IIS snap-in, right-click the root of your Web site and choose
  Properties. On the Home Directory tab, make sure that the Index this
  Directory check box is checked. Now, try your query again.

6. Make sure that the directory you are trying to return results from has its
  Index this Directory check box checked.

7. Index Server does its indexing as the System account. If the System account
  does not have at least Read permissions on the files that are to be
  cataloged, the files will not be indexed. Also, make sure the System account
  has Full Access permissions on the root of the drive that physically contains
  the catalog, and on the Catalog.wci directory.

8. You are only allowed to view results that you have permissions to see. If you
  are accessing the query page as the anonymous user, you need to make sure
  that the anonymous user has at least Read permissions to the document you are
  trying to find. This goes for any user that is attaching to the query page.

9. Authenticate coming into the query page as an administrator if possible. Try
  setting the directory that the query page is located in to Basic/Clear Text
  authentication only, so that you receive a prompt when you attempt to connect
  to that page. If you log in as an administrator and still receive a "No
  Documents Found" message, more than likely, you do not have a permissions
  issue. If you get results, you do have a permissions issue. As an alternative
  to this, temporarily add the anonymous user to the Administrators group in
  User Manager.

10. If you are querying on a specific page and it is returning in a #filename
  query, but it is not being filtered (abstract is not populated), and it is
  an HTM, HTML, or ASP page, make sure you do not have a ROBOTS=NOINDEX
  metatag in the header of the document. This will not prevent indexing, but
  it will prevent filtering.

11. If the files are on an NTFS partition on a Windows 2000 computer, go into
  Properties for the folder or drive. On the General tab, click Advanced. Make
  sure that the "For fast searching, allow Indexing Service to index this
  file" check box is selected.
