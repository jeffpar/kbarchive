-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a file was pinned when a label was applied to its parent project, and you GET
the file at that label after it has been unpinned, you will not get the pinned
version.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you GET the parent project at the label, the correct version of the file is
retrieved.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Create a new project. (for example, $/myproj).

2. Set a working folder for the project. (for example, C:\Myproj)

3. Add a file to the project. (for example, Myfile.txt)

4. Check out, modify, and check in the Myfile.txt so that there are two
  versions.

5. Pin Myfile.txt at version one.

6. Select the $/myproj project.

7. Label $/myproj with the label "test".

8. Unpin Myfile.txt

9. Show the history of Myfile.txt and select the version that displays the label

10. Get the labeled version.

Note that you will get a copy of version two of the file, where you might have
expected version one, which was the the version it was pinned to when the label
was applied.
If you perform a GET on the same label from the command line:

     ss get $/myproj/myfile.txt -VLtest

- If the database has been updated to the Visual SourceSafe 6.0 format, you
  will see the behavior described in the SYMPTOMS section.

- If the database has not been updated to the Visual SourceSafe 6.0 format,
  version one will be retrieved.
