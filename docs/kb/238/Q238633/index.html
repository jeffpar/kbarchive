-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you leave the "Search in this collection" box in the Create Direct Membership
Wizard blank while you are creating a collection based on a direct membership
rule, you may receive the following error message:

  You do not have Class Read Resource security rights, therefore you must
  specify a collection.

If you select a specific collection to be limited to in the Collection Limiting
dialog box, you may receive the following error message:

  You do not have Read Resource security rights to the collection specified.
  You must specify a different collection."

When this problem occurs, you cannot finish the Create Direct Membership Rule
Wizard. However, you can successfully create a collection based on a query.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur if you are logged on as a user who belongs to a global
group that has been granted the appropriate rights to the Collections class to
create new collections. However, the Direct Membership Rule Wizard does not
correctly determine the global group membership of the current user.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, assign Read and Read Resource collection class
rights in addition to the Create right to individual users who need to create
collections based on direct membership rules.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, use the appropriate method.

Method 1: Using the Hotfix Installer
------------------------------------

NOTE: This method is only for I386-based computers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a share on your network. Q238633.exe is a
  Microsoft Windows Installer file that updates specific files on your site
  server.

2. Log on to your site server using an account with administrative privileges.

3. On the site server, close the Systems Management Server Administrator
  console.

4. Run Q238633.exe and follow the directions in the wizard. You can run the file
  in Quiet mode using the /s switch.

5. Shut down and restart the SMS site server.

Method 2: Manual Installation
-----------------------------

1. Close the Systems Management Server Administrator console.

2. Run RegSvr32.exe to unregister the files that you are about to update. To do
  so, type the following at a command prompt:

  " regsvr32 /u mmcbasui.dll
  regsvr32 /u mmcbsuir.dll

  " (without the quotation marks)


3. Replace the Mmcbasui.dll file in the
  &lt;Sms_root_directory&gt;\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the version
  obtained from the hotfix. Run RegSvr32.exe to register the updated file. To
  do so, type the following at a command prompt:

  " regsvr32 mmcbasui.dll " (without the quotation marks)

4. Replace the Mmcbsuir.dll file in the
  &lt;Sms_root_directory&gt;\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the version
  obtained from the hotfix.
  Run RegSvr32.exe to register the updated file. To do so, type the following at
  a command prompt:

  " regsvr32 mmcbsuir.dll " (without the quotation marks)
