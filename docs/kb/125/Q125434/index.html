SUMMARY
=======

The Reattach NWIND module in the Solutions sample application (SOLUTION.MDB)
demonstrates a method of updating the connection information for attached tables
in an application that uses multiple databases. This method assumes that a
wizard utility database (WZLIB.MDA) is specified in the [Libraries] section of
the MSACC20.INI file and that the MSAU200.DLL file is installed in the Microsoft
Access directory. If these files are not loaded (such as when you are running a
run-time version of Microsoft Access), then the method in the Solutions sample
application does not work.

This article describes how you can modify the method in the Reattach NWIND module
to work in a run-time environment.

NOTE: In Microsoft Access for Windows 95, the RefreshTableLinks module of the
Solutions.mdb is completely self-contained. It does not rely on any references
to a wizard library.

This article assumes that you are familiar with Access Basic and with creating
Microsoft Access applications using the programming tools provided with
Microsoft Access. For more information about Access Basic, please refer to the
"Building Applications" manual.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To modify the method in the Reattach NWIND module to work in a run-time
environment, follow these steps while running the retail version of Microsoft
Access. Each of these steps is described in detail later in this article.

1. Import the sample code from SOLUTION.MDB.

2. Add a user-defined type from the WZLIB.MDA file.

3. Add declare functions from the WZLIB.MDA file.

4. Modify the sample GetMDBName() function.

5. Modify the sample GetMDBName2() function.

6. Modify the sample AreTablesAttached() function.

7. Add the MSAU200.DLL file to your application's Setup using the Setup Wizard.

8. Call the AreTablesAttached() function in your application's Autoexec macro.

The following sections describe in detail each of the steps above.

Step 1: Import the Sample Code from SOLUTION.MDB
------------------------------------------------

1. With your database open, choose Import from the File menu.

2. In the Data Source box, select Microsoft Access and then choose OK.

3. In the File Name box, select SOLUTION.MDB and then choose OK.

4. In the Object Type box, select Modules. In the Objects In SOLUTION.MDB box,
  select Reattach NWIND and then choose the Import button.

5. When you are prompted "Successfully imported 'Reattach NWIND'" choose OK.

6. Choose the Close button.

Step 2: Add a User-Defined Type from the WZLIB.MDA File
-------------------------------------------------------

Add the following Type statement to the Declarations section of the Reattach
NWIND module you imported in the step above:

     Type GetFileNameInfo
        hwndOwner As Integer
        szFilter As String * 255
        szCustomFilter As String * 255
        nFilterIndex As Long
        szFile As String * 255
        szFileTitle As String * 255
        szInitialDir As String * 255
        szTitle As String * 255
        Flags As Long
        nFileOffset As Integer
        nFileExtension As Integer
        szDefExt As String * 255
     End Type

Note that this Type statement was copied from the wizard utility database
(WZLIB.MDA) and renamed to avoid conflicts.

Step 3: Add Declare Functions from the WZLIB.MDA File
-----------------------------------------------------

NOTE: In the following sample code, an underscore (_) at the end of a line is
used as a line-continuation character. Remove the underscore from the end of the
line when re-creating this code in Access Basic.

1. Add the following API declaration to the Declarations section of the Reattach
  NWIND module you imported:

        Declare Function MSAU_GetFileName Lib "MSAU200.DLL" Alias "#1" _
        (gfni As GetFileNameInfo, ByVal fOpen As Integer) As Long

  Note that this function was copied from WZLIB.MDA and renamed to avoid
  conflicts.

2. Add the following API declaration to make the common dialog box modal.

  NOTE: You may have some Microsoft Windows API functions defined in an existing
  Microsoft Access library; therefore, your declarations may be duplicates. If
  you receive a duplicate procedure name error message, remove or comment out
  the declarations statement in your code.

        Declare Function MSA_FindWindow Lib "User" Alias "FindWindow" _
        (ByVal lpClassName As Any, ByVal lpWindowName As Any) As Integer

Step 4: Modify the Sample GetMDBName() Function
-----------------------------------------------

Follow these steps to modify the GetMDBName() function to use the new type you
defined above, make the Find Database dialog box modal, and use the database
name you specify:

1. Search the GetMDBName() function for the following line:

        Dim OFN As wlib_GetFileNameInfo

2. Modify the line as follows to reference the new type:

        Dim OFN As GetFileNameInfo

3. Search the GetMDBName() function for the following line:

        OFN.hwndOwner = 0

4. Modify the line as follows to make the Find Database dialog box modal:

        OFN.hwndOwner = MSA_FindWindow("OMain", 0&amp;)

5. Search the GetMDBName() function for the following line:

        OFN.szTitle = "Where is your NWIND.MDB?"

6. Change the line so that it uses the name of your database instead of
  NWIND.MDB.

Step 5: Modify the Sample GetMDBName2() Function
------------------------------------------------

NOTE: In the following sample code, an underscore (_) at the end of a line is
used as a line-continuation character. Remove the underscore from the end of the
line when re-creating this code in Access Basic.

Follow these steps to modify the GetMDBName2() function to use the new type you
defined above:

1. Find the following GetMDBName2() parameters line:

        Function GetMDBName2(gfni As wlib_GetFileNameInfo, ByVal fopen _
        as Integer) As Long

2. Modify the line to read:

        Function GetMDBName2(gfni As GetFileNameInfo, ByVal fopen _
        as Integer) As Long

3. Search the GetMDBName2() function for the following line:

        lRet = wlib_MSAU_GetFileName(gfni, fOpen)

4. Modify the line as follows to reference the new type:

        lRet = MSAU_GetFileName(gfni, fOpen)

Step 6: Modify the Sample AreTablesAttached() Function
------------------------------------------------------

Follow these steps to modify the AreTablesAttached() function to look for a table
in your attached database and replace references to NWIND.MDB and SOLUTION.MDB
with references to your application:

1. Search the AreTablesAttached() function for the following line:

        Set MyRecords = MyDB.OpenRecordset("Products")

2. Replace the Products table with the name of the appropriate table in your
  attached database.

3. Search for and replace all references to NWIND.MDB and SOLUTION.MDB. Replace
  these references with your database names.

Step 7: Add MSAU200.DLL to Application's Setup Using the Setup Wizard
---------------------------------------------------------------------

When you create your application's Setup disks with the Setup Wizard, follow
these steps to add the MSAU200.DLL file to the list of files to be included with
your application:

1. Start the Setup Wizard.

2. Add your databases to the Files To Include list.

3. Choose the Add File button.

4. In the File Name box, type "&lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;access&gt;\MSAU200.DLL"
  (without the quotation marks) where &lt;drive&gt; and &lt;access&gt; are the
  hard disk and directory containing your copy of Microsoft Access. For
  example, if you have Microsoft Access installed in the \ACCESS directory on
  drive C, type "C:\ACCESS\MSAU200.DLL" (without the quotation marks).

5. In the Destination box, select $(AppPath).

6. Choose OK.

7. Proceed through the Setup Wizard as normal.

Step 8: Call AreTablesAttached() Function in Application's AutoExec Macro
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the Solutions sample application, the Autoexec macro calls the
AreTablesAttached() function. This function determines whether the table
attachments are valid. If the attachments are not valid, the function prompts
the user for the location of the attached tables. If the function returns True,
the tables were successfully reattached. If the function returns False, the
tables could not be found in the user-specified path and the database is
closed.

The AutoExec macro from the SOLUTION.MDB database is listed below:

  Condition                 Action
  ------------------------------------
  NOT AreTablesAttached()   DoMenuItem
                            OpenForm

  Action Arguments
  --------------------------
  DoMenuItem
     Menu Bar: Database
     Menu Name: File
     Command: Close Database
  OpenForm
     Form Name: Startup
