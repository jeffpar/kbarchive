SUMMARY
=======

You can run shared applications from Systems Management Server version 1.0 by
using the Appstart program to select an appropriate application server. There
are three ways Appstart locates a server (in order):

- Existing Share

- Existing Server

- Random

Existing Share
--------------

If an existing connection to a needed share exists, Appstart piggy-backs or
reuses the existing share connection. Appstart assumes that a previous attempt
to connect was made, and, during that attempt, these same rules were followed.
This is done to maximize load balancing on the initial connection, and minimize
the total number of distinct connections a client makes.

Existing Server
---------------

If there is already a session established with the server providing the desired
share and a connection to the share does not already exist, Appstart connects to
this server and share. Quite often a local connection will exist to the SMS
Windows NT logon server (and SMS_SHR) that authenticated the logon. For this
reason, the majority of Appstart requests will go to a Windows NT (or LAN
Manager) domain controller local to the client computer.

Random
------

If no shares or servers are connected that have the desired resources, Appstart
will randomly pick from the list in the network accounts database (NAD).

Random selection is rarely performed after either the existing share or server
methods have been used. They are oriented to the local subnet, while the random
method acts as a safety net. The random selection will most likely be made on
the local subnet, but it cannot be guaranteed in SMS version 1.0. That is why
the existing share and server methods are attempted first. To ensure a local
connection, you can add a NET USE command to a local distribution server in the
logon script. Then you guarantee a session because Appstart will always check
for an existing server before choosing randomly.
