The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
- Microsoft LAN Manager, version 2.2c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes a procedure that ensures proper replication of login
scripts from a Windows NT server to a LAN Manager server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

On The LAN Manager Server
-------------------------

1. Check for the following entries in the LANMAN.INI file and create them if
  they do not exist:

  In the [replicator] section:

  replicate = import

  importpath = &lt;ImportPath&gt;
  (For example, REPL\ACCTS. This must be relative to the LANMAN directory and is
  needed only if your import directory is something other than repl\import)

  importlist = &lt;WindowsNTServerName&gt;
  (For example, SALES-PDC)

  logon = &lt;LanManagerAccount&gt;
  (Must be the same as the account used on the Windows NT export server)

  password = &lt;LanManagerPassword&gt;
  (must be the same as the account used on the Windows NT export server) tryuser
  = &lt;yes or no&gt;
  (default = yes, set to "no" if you do not want the LAN Manager server to
  attempt to update directories while a user is logged on locally)

  In the [netlogon] section:

  scripts = &lt;ScriptsPath&gt;
  (For example, REPL\IMPORT\SCRIPTS)

2. Create the import path directory tree if it does not exist (ie.
  C:\LANMAN\REPL\IMPORT\SCRIPTS).

3. Start the Replicator Service on the LAN Manager server with the command, NET
  START REPLICATOR. You may also want to add the Replicator Service to the list
  of services started automatically in the [server] section of the LANMAN.INI
  file, per the following example:

  srvservices = alerter,netlogon,replicator

On The Windows NT Server
------------------------

1. Create the replication account in User Manager for Domains, making sure that
  the username and password match the account being used on the LAN Manager
  server. Also, make sure that all options requiring user intervention (such as
  User Must Change Password at Next Logon) are disabled.

2. Add the replication username to the Domain Users, Backup Operators, and
  Replicator groups and exit User Manager for Domains.

3. Start the Services option in Control Panel and from the Service list, select
  Directory Replicator. Then choose the Startup button.

4. Under Startup Type, select the Automatic option button.

5. Under Log On As, select the This Account option button and choose the ...
  button to open the Add User window and obtain the Names list.

6. Select the replicator account from the Names list, choose the Add button, and
  then choose the OK button.

7. Under Log On As, enter the password for the replicator account in the
  Password box, re-enter the password in the Confirm Password box, and choose
  the OK button and then the Close button to close the Services window.

8. Run the Server option in Control Panel, choose the Replication button, select
  the Export Directories option button, and verify that the path shown in the
  From Path box is correct. For example:

  C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\REPL\EXPORT

9. From the Directory Replication window (opened in step 8 ), choose the Add
  button under the To List field, select the name of the LAN Manager server or
  the domain in which the LAN Manager server resides from the Select Domain
  list, and then choose the OK button to close the Select Domain window. Choose
  the OK button to close the Directory Replication window and choose the OK
  button to close the Server window.

10. Start the Services option in Control Panel again and from the Service list
  select Directory Replicator. Choose the Start button to start the Directory
  Replicator service and then choose the OK button to close the Services
  window.

11. Start the Servers option in Control Panel again and choose the Shares button
  to view replication activity when it occurs. You can view the replication
  session establishment in the Connected Users box by watching for a username
  using the REPL$ share.

If Replication Does Not Occur
-----------------------------

Follow these steps if an initial replication does not occur.

1. Stop and restart the Directory Replicator service via the Services option in
  Control Panel on the Windows NT server and check for any errors in Event
  Viewer. If no errors regarding this service exist, proceed to step 11 above
  to watch for replication to occur.

2. Stop and restart the Replicator service on the LAN Manager server by issuing
  the following commands in succession:

  NET STOP REPLICATOR NET START REPLICATOR

  After issuing these commands on the LAN Manager server, you should see the
  file OK$ in the import directory of the LAN Manager server.

3. If replication problems persist, check Event Viewer on the Windows NT server
  and the error log on the LAN Manager server (using the command NET ERROR) for
  indications of specific error conditions related to replication.

Microsoft Knowledge Base.
