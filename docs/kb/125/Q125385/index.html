-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

File Manager and the Windows NT Command Prompt DIR command incorrectly report
file date, time, and size information.

CAUSE
=====

This problems occurs when the file date, time, and size information stored in
the directory entry for a file is not updated from the file date, time, and size
information stored in the file record. As a result, file date, time, and size
data are not displayed correctly when a non-specific or wildcard DIR command
(one that does not explicitly specify a single file name) is issued.

This problem only affects files on Windows NT machines which have been modified
by non-Windows NT client workstations.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, explicitly specify the file name in a DIR command,
or open and close the file exhibiting the problem with an application.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The NTFS file system maintains the current date, time, and size in the file
record. It also contains duplicate information in the directory entry for quick
reference by applications that do not need to access the actual file data (such
as the DIR command). This results in a substantial performance improvement when
only the file date, time, or size is being requested.

For performance reasons, when an application has a file open NTFS ignores the
directory copy of file date, time, and size information. When the file is
closed, or when an application makes an explicit request to update the
information, the directory copy of the information is updated.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.5. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
