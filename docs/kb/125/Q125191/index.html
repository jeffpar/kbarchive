-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When viewing the BOOTLOG.TXT file in the Windows directory, you may see the
following line:

       LoadFail = NETAPI.DLL Failure code is 02

CAUSE
=====

This error code is placed in the BOOTLOG.TXT file during Setup. Error code 02
means that the file (in this case, NETAPI.DLL) was not found.

When setting up Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 3.11, Setup searches for
NETAPI.DLL. If Setup cannot find NETAPI.DLL, an error entry is placed in
BOOTLOG.TXT file.

When you run WIN /B, Windows for Workgroups appends the original BOOTLOG.TXT file
that Setup created. The failure code error remains in the BOOTLOG.TXT file until
the file is deleted.

RESOLUTION
==========

The "LoadFail = NETAPI.DLL Failure code is 02" entry in the BOOTLOG.TXT file is
added during Setup only. You can rename or delete the BOOTLOG.TXT file so that a
new file will be created when you run WIN /B.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The LoadFail error is recorded in the BOOTLOG.TXT file when installing Windows
for Workgroups 3.11 in the following ways:

- When you upgrade Windows 3.x to Windows for Workgroups 3.11

- When you upgrade Windows for Workgroups 3.1 to Windows for Workgroups 3.11

- When you install Windows for Workgroups 3.11 to a clean directory

When installing over an existing Windows for Workgroups 3.11 installation, this
error is not recorded in the BOOTLOG.TXT file unless NETAPI.DLL is missing or
damaged.
