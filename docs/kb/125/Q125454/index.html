SUMMARY
=======

The services running on a Systems Management Server site require various
administrator-type rights on all site server systems maintained by Systems
Management Server. This article describes what rights are required for the
supported configurations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Systems Management Server service account requires administrative rights on
each Systems Management Server maintained server. Systems Management Server
creates new shares and directories on each installed server in order to populate
them with files.

On Windows NT and OS/2 servers, Systems Management Server installs and starts the
Inventory Agent service. On Windows NT servers, Systems Management Server also
installs the Package Command Manager. To install these services, the Systems
Management Server Windows NT service account must have the right to logon as a
service at each Windows NT server.

For a single Windows NT domain Systems Management Server site, the Systems
Management Server service account must be in the Domain Administrators group and
have been granted Logon As A Service rights. If OS/2 servers are added to the
Windows NT domain, the Systems Management Server service account must be in the
Global Administrators group.

If an OS/2 domain is added to an existing Systems Management Server site, create
an identical Systems Management Server user account in the Administrators group
on the OS/2 domain (with the same password). This is necessary because OS/2 does
not understand the concept of Local groups.

If a NetWare domain is added, each NetWare server must have a supervisor-
equivalent user account identical to the Windows NT Systems Management Server
account.

If you add a Windows NT domain to an existing site, create a one-way trust
relationship from the new domain to the domain that contains the Systems
Management Server service account. When the trust relationship is active, add
the Systems Management Server service account to the Local Administrators group
in the new domain and give the account the right to Logon As A Service. Make
sure that you use the full &lt;trusted domain&gt;\&lt;username&gt; syntax. This
ensures that the proper domain validates the account through the trust
relationship.

When connecting sites in a hierarchy, no administrative rights are required, and
you do not have to create a trust relationship between the sites. The connection
address for the respective sites must include the &lt;destination
domain&gt;\&lt;username&gt; of the other site, and the account must have Change
access to the Sms_Site share.
