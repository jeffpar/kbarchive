The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright for Windows, version 1.0 
- the operating system: Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright when running on Windows 3.x , you may
not be able to hear the sounds in the program.

Note that although you cannot hear sounds in Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright, Wave
Form Audio (.WAV) files may be played normally through Media Player; therefore,
applications capable of playing .WAV files will play sounds as expected.

CAUSE
=====

Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright sends sound to the driver specified by the wave=
line in the [drivers] section of the SYSTEM.INI file. Other applications may use
the Sound Mapper settings, which allow a choice among several installed wave
devices. Therefore, it is possible for sounds to work in programs that use Sound
Mapper, but not in Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright, which bypasses Sound Mapper.

RESOLUTION
==========

To verify that the wave= line in the SYSTEM.INI [drivers] section is pointing to
the correct wave driver, do the following:

1. In a text editor, such as Windows Notepad, open the SYSTEM.INI file (this
  file is located in the Windows directory).

2. In the SYSTEM.INI file, locate the [drivers] section. If the [drivers]
  section includes the following lines:

        wave=speaker.drv
        wave1=&lt;driver&gt;

  where &lt;driver&gt; is the wave driver for your sound card, the Ultimate
  Frank Lloyd Wright will send sound to the PC-Speaker driver (SPEAKER.DRV).
  This driver cannot play all types of audio.

3. To correct this problem, modify the lines to read:

        wave=&lt;driver&gt;
        wave1=speaker.drv

4. Exit Windows and restart Windows.

The Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright should play sounds correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The currently installed devices are specified by the following entries in your
SYSTEM.INI file

  wave=
  wave1=
  wave2=

Note that any wave&lt;n&gt;= entry (where &lt;n&gt; is a number) is a valid
SYSTEM.INI entry.

For more information on audio problems, refer to the Ultimate Frank Lloyd Wright
README.TXT file, or the documentation that came with your sound card.
