The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows 1994 edition 
- the operating system: Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After successfully printing the first print job from within Bookshelf 1994, all
subsequent print jobs will fail. Further attempts will display an hourglass
followed by no response.

CAUSE
=====

This problem has been confirmed when using the PostScript driver version 3.5
shipped with Microsoft Windows 3.1, and the Microsoft PostScript driver version
3.58 obtained from the Microsoft Download Services (BBS).

The HP 4/ML is a Level 2 PostScript printer. The PostScript driver that comes
with Windows only supports PostScript level 1.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the printer driver to the HP 4/ML driver that is available from
Hewlett-Packard.

-or-

Install the HP LaserJet III printer driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Adobe PostScript is a page description language (PDL). A PDL has several
components that allow it to manipulate fonts, raster graphics, vector graphics,
color, and peripheral support (that is, sheet feeders and other resources).
There are two levels of the PostScript language:

Level 1 PostScript Language
---------------------------

This is the industry standard used by desktop publishing (DTP) companies, service
bureaus, and supported by the PostScript printer driver version 3.5 that ships
with Windows 3.1.

Level 2 PostScript Language
---------------------------

This is an enhanced version of Level 1 that comes with additional support for
color imaging, fax PostScript documents, data compression, improved forms
handling, cache patterns and forms between multiple printings of the same
document. It also generates accurate screen angles for smoother halftone
printing. Level 2 also compresses and decompresses documents.

This level is currently supported by only a few printers, such as the Apple
LaserWriter IIF. The PostScript driver for Windows 3.1 does not support Level
2.

If you have questions about your printer or printer driver, call Hewlett- Packard
technical support at (208) 323-2551
