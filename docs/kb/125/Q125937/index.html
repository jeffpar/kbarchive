SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to accomplish the following:

- Create table-of-contents entry fields (TC fields) and build a table of
  contents

CREATING TC FIELDS AND BUILDING A TABLE OF CONTENTS
---------------------------------------------------

There are two ways to mark table of contents items: you can create a custom menu
command, or you can use the keyboard.

Method 1: Using a Custom Menu Command
-------------------------------------

Part A: To add the MarkTableofContentsEntry menu command to the Insert menu,
follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Customize, and then click the Toolbars tab.

2. Click to select the Menu Bar check box.

  NOTE: This option is on by default.

3. In the Customize dialog box, click the Commands tab.

4. In the Categories list, select All Commands.

5. In the Commands list, select MarkTableOfContentsEntry and drag the command to
  the Insert menu.

  Point to the location where you want the command to appear on the menu, and
  then release the mouse.

6. In the Customize dialog box, Click Close.

Part B: To mark the text for inclusion in the table of contents, follow these
steps:

1. Select (highlight) the text you want to include.

2. On the Insert menu, click Mark Table Of Contents Entry.

3. In the Entry box, modify the text if you want it to be different from the
  selected text.

  entry.

7. Click Close.

8. Repeat steps 1 through 7 for each table of contents entry you want to create.

Building the Table of Contents
------------------------------

To build the table of contents, follow these steps:

2. On the Insert menu, click Index And Tables.

2. On the Insert menu, click Mark Index Entry.

  occurrences of the selected text.

5. Click Close.
