The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Systems Management Server allows you to trace the actions
performed by the SMS services. When tracing is enabled, each service makes log
entries for actions that it performs or errors that it receives in a log file.
The log files are ASCII text and can be viewed with a text editor. However, SMS
includes a Tracer utility that parses these log files and presents them in a
clearer, more user-friendly manner than plain text viewing. Tracer also allows
interactive viewing of the SMS log files as the services are writing to them.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are currently two versions of this utility, TRACER.EXE and SMSTRACE.EXE

TRACER.EXE is a command line console-mode utility that reads changes made to a
text file in real time. This file is located in the PSSTOOL\&lt;arch&gt;
directory on the SMS 1.0 and 1.1 CD-ROM. For SMS 1.2 it is located in the
SUPPORT\DEBUG\&lt;arch&gt; directory on the CD-ROM.

  Usage: tracer &lt;path to one of the SMS log files&gt;

SMSTRACE.EXE is a graphical user interface (GUI) multiple document interface
(MDI) version and is included in the SITE.SRV\&lt;arch&gt;.BIN directory.

SMSTRACE.EXE allows you to customize the display by selecting options such as
columns, filtering, and ignore new lines. You can also Cut and Paste and Print
from SMSTRACE. SMSTRACE.EXE also allows viewing of several log files
simultaneously.

To install SMSTRACE as an icon in the SMS group:

1. Open the Systems Management Server group windows.

2. From the Program Manager File menu, select New.

3. Choose New Program Item. For the Command Line, enter:

  &lt;drive&gt;:\sms\site.srv\&lt;arch&gt;.BIN\SMSTRACE.EXE

  For the working directory, enter:

  &lt;drive&gt;:\sms\site.srv\&lt;arch&gt;.BIN

The SMS services log files are all located in the SMS\LOGS directory except for
the Site Configuration Manager log file SCMAN.LOG and the Bootstrap log file
BOOT.LOG.

writes to them:
