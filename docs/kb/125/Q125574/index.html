-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Server Manager, or Control Panel Server, the value for File Locks is very
large (over four billion).

CAUSE
=====

The Server service does not increment the File Locks count after successfully
locking a byte range in response to a Lock&amp;Read Server Message Block (SMB)
(typically issued by a LAN Manager version 2.2c client (either MS-DOS- or OS/2)-
based). However, the Server service does correctly decrement the File Lock count
in response to a later Lock&amp;X SMB which unlocks the same byte range. As a
result, the zero File Lock count is decremented to 0xFFFFFFFF. Because is an
unsigned value, it is displayed as 4294967295.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. A fix to
this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for more information on the availability of this fix. This is a hotfix, and
distribution requires manager approval. To receive the hotfix, customers must be
encountering the bug as described above. You must track the customers you send
this to and supply them with the next Service Pack when it becomes available. To
obtain the new file, contact the Escalation Team. The new file is SRV.SYS on
