When passing parameters by value to a BASIC SUBprogram or FUNCTION
procedure, you must use the BYVAL attribute from both the calling end
and the receiving end.

By itself, using BYVAL in the SUB or FUNCTION statement (at the
receiving end) isn't enough to tell the SUB or FUNCTION to pass by
value. If you don't also use the BYVAL attribute in the CALL statement
or the DECLARE statement, then by default BASIC will pass by reference
and push only the address of the variable on the stack. If you
mistakenly use BYVAL only at the calling end or only at the receiving
end, then an incorrect value will be passed.

This information only applies to Microsoft BASIC Professional
Development System (PDS) version 7.10, since passing parameters to
BASIC SUBprograms and FUNCTIONS with the BYVAL attribute was first
introduced version 7.10.

Note for Versions Earlier Than 7.10: In Microsoft BASIC PDS version
7.00, in Microsoft BASIC Compiler versions 6.00 and 6.00b, and in
QuickBASIC versions 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50, you could not DECLARE or
CALL a BASIC routine with parameters having the BYVAL attribute, since
BYVAL could be used only for parameters of non-BASIC routines (such as
C or Macro Assembler).

NOTE: If you create a program in an editor outside the QBX.EXE
environment without DECLARE statements at the top of the program,
DECLARE statements will not automatically be added to your code. As a
result, a SUB statement that contains a formal parameter with the
BYVAL attribute (at the receiving end) will have no BYVAL declaration
at the calling end. Instead of specifying BYVAL in a DECLARE
statement, you can specify BYVAL in the CALL statement.

Code Example: Incorrect Way to Pass by Value
--------------------------------------------

The program below, written in an editor outside of the QBX.EXE
environment, will pass the offset of the variable A&amp; to the
SUBprogram, although the SUBprogram is expecting the actual value
contained in A&amp;. This happens because each end of the call to the
SUBprogram acts blindly on the information that it has. The call to
TestPass blindly assumes that it is passing a value by reference,
which is the default. It therefore passes the offset (in this case
3030) of the variable A&amp; to the SUBprogram TestPass. The SUBprogram
TestPass is expecting to receive the value of the variable A&amp;, as is
dictated by the BYVAL attribute in the SUB statement. The program
therefore prints 3030 (the offset) on the screen, instead of the
constant 2 (the value).

CALL TestPass (2&amp;)  'Notice no declaration of BYVAL in CALL or
                    'DECLARE, so default is pass (send) by reference.
SUB TestPass(BYVAL A&amp;)  'BYVAL in SUB says to pass (receive) by value.
    B&amp; = A&amp;
    PRINT A&amp;        ' Prints 3030, the offset of A&amp;.
END SUB

Correct Way to Pass by Value, Using BYVAL in DECLARE and SUB
------------------------------------------------------------

DECLARE SUB TestPass(BYVAL A&amp;)
' BYVAL in the above DECLARE means to pass (send) by value.
CALL TestPass (2&amp;)
SUB TestPass(BYVAL A&amp;)  'BYVAL in SUB means pass (receive) by value.
    B&amp; = A&amp;
    PRINT A&amp;      ' prints 2, the value (contents) of A&amp;
END SUB

Another Correct Way to Pass by Value, Using BYVAL in CALL and SUB
-----------------------------------------------------------------

CALL TestPass (BYVAL 2&amp;)  'BYVAL in CALL means pass (send) by value.
SUB TestPass(BYVAL A&amp;)    'BYVAL in SUB means pass (receive) by value.
    B&amp; = A&amp;
    PRINT A&amp;      ' prints 2, the value (contents) of A&amp;
END SUB

The following is taken from the README.DOC file for BASIC 7.10:

   In version 7.10, BASIC supports the use of the BYVAL keyword
   in CALL, DECLARE, SUB, and FUNCTION statements for BASIC
   procedures. You can use BYVAL to pass parameters by value
   rather than by reference (the default). It is no longer
   necessary to enclose parameters in parentheses to emulate
   passing by value. For more information and an example of using
   BYVAL in BASIC procedures, see the online Help for the DECLARE
   statement (BASIC procedures). For specifics on using BYVAL with
   CALL, see the online Help for the CALL statement (BASIC
   procedures).
