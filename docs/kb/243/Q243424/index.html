SUMMARY
=======

FileImg.exe is an unsupported utility that takes snapshots of the entire
contents of any directory on your machine. It displays important information
about all files and subdirectories such as version, size, date, and attributes.
It also lets you compare two images to determine how the files in a target
directory have changed.

For example, you can use FileImg to determine exactly what files were installed
or updated by an application. This can be useful when deploying an application
to ensure that no system components are being overwritten with older files. You
can also use FileImg for troubleshooting problems on two machines. Often there
are two similar machines, but only one machine is experiencing problems. By
comparing the versions of system files on the two machines, you could determine
which system files need to be updated on the problem machine.
