The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

If you change the registry entry for the trace file path of a service to
anything other than %SnaRoot%\Traces, the trace files are not deleted when you
use the Purge All Trace Files option in the SNA Trace utility (Snatrace.exe).

CAUSE
=====

The delete operation used when selecting Purge All Trace Files is different than
the create operation used when the SNA Trace utility is started.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
4.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 4.0. This
problem was first corrected in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
In some cases, after you apply Service Pack 3, traces may not appear in the
specified folder, or in the %SnaRoot%\Traces folder. If this happens, remove the
following registry key and restart the SNA Trace utility (Snatrace.exe):

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SNA Server\CurrentVersion\Traces

This key is rebuilt when the SNA Trace utility is restarted.
