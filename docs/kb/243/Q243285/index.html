SUMMARY
=======

The Win32 API GetGlyphOutline function can return native glyph outline data from
a TrueType font. To draw a TrueType glyph outline, the data must be converted
from its native B-Spline definition to a sequence of Bezier line definitions.
Then the PolyBezier Win32 API function can be used to draw the outline.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The GetGlyphOutline function in the Win32 Application Programming Interface(API)
can retrieve a TrueType outline. The GGO_NATIVE format option fills a buffer
with Quadratic B-Spline curves for a TrueType outline. Quadratic B-Splines are
used by TrueType to describe the glyph outline in a TrueType font file. To draw
these outline curves one can implement a B-Spline drawing function or use the
PolyBezier function from the Win32 API.

Quadratic B-Spline curves are a class of parametric curves that define the path
of multiple curve segments via a few control points. A Quadratic curve is a
second order parametric curve. There is no function in the API to draw a
Quadratic Spline directly but if the Quadratic is converted to a Cubic it can be
drawn with the Win32 API function for drawing a Bezier curve; called
PolyBezier.

Quadratic B-Spline curves in particular and parametric curves in general are a
well-researched topic of graphics in computer science. They can also be quite
complex. Algorithms have been published in various texts that can be used to
implement a function to draw a Quadratic Spline, but describing such an
algorithm is beyond the scope of this article.

The PolyBezier function can draw a Quadratic Spline because a Bezier curve is a
cubic or third order parametric curve. Since a Quadratic Spline is a second
order equation, it can be expressed in terms of the higher order cubic equation.
Although an equation for expressing a quadratic as a cubic is given in the
sample code, its derivation is not discussed in this article.

The sample code in this article is a demonstration of how to parse a GGO_NATIVE
glyph buffer returned by the GetGlyphOutline function. The buffer returned by
the GGO_NATIVE format flag conforms to the TTPOLYGONHEADER structure. The
TTPOLYGONHEADER structure and the data that immediately follows it constitute
one contour of a TrueType glyph. A contour is one complete path of curves that
is implicitly closed if it is not explicitly returned that way.

Please see the Platform SDK for documentation on the TTPOLYGONHEADER and
TTPOLYCURVE structures.

A glyph contour consists of multiple curve segments represented by TTPOLYCURVE
structures. In a contour, the TTPOLYGONHEADER is followed by one or more
TTPOLYCURVE structures and coordinate point data. The pfxStart member gives the
starting coordinate point of the contour. The count of curve records that follow
the TTPOLYGONHEADER is given by the cb member. The starting point is relative to
the origin of the glyph. The origin of a glyph is the lower left corner of the
character at the character's baseline.

Each TTPOLYCURVE curve record (a curve segment) consists of either Quadratic
B-Spline control points or simple Polyline points. The count of points is given
by the TTPOLYCURVEcpfx member. The curve type of either spline or polyline is
given by the wType member. The array of coordinate points immediately follow the
structure. The starting point of the curve is given by the apfx member.

Since a glyph may contain more than one contour, the buffer contains one or more
groups of TTPOLYGONHEADER structures and data. Subsequent contours are packed
immediately following the previous one in the native buffer. The next contour
starts with a TTPOLYGONHEADER at the next byte beyond the last point of the
previous curve record.

This sample code draws the outline of a TrueType glyph by parsing the GGO_NATIVE
buffer to create a list of Bezier line segments that form each contour. The list
of Bezier line segments is then drawn using PolyBezier. The code that parses the
buffer is in the DrawT2Outline function.

The first step to create a list of Bezier lines is to determine the size of the
buffer for the list. Four points define Bezier lines. The PolyBezier function
interprets an array of points as being one continuous line of Bezier segments
where the start of the next line is coincident with the endpoint of the previous
line. Thus, only three points are needed to describe an additional Bezier line
segment.

The GGO_NATIVE buffer may contain either a polyline curve or a Quadratic B-Spline
curve. Two points define a line segment while three points define a B-Spline.
Since each type is to be drawn with a Bezier line using PolyBezier, the worst
case scenario occurs when one contour that is entirely composed of line segments
expands to multiple Beziers.

Note that to express an additional curve segment in a B-Spline curve
representation requires only one additional point. That point explicitly defines
the "B" or off curve point and implicitly defines the additional on curve point.
The on curve point is the midpoint to the next "B" point. Thus either an
additional line segment or an additional curve segment will expand to three
additional points of a Bezier line.

The code assumes that the entire native buffer will consist of POINTFX structures
so it can determine the largest possible number of points represented by the
buffer. The actual number is slightly smaller since there is structure overhead
in describing the contours and curves. The size of the buffer for the Bezier
list is given by the maximum possible number of points multiplied by the data
size of a POINT structure and multiplied by three. Three is the number of
additional points that are needed for each additional line segment or quadratic
spline segment when converted to a Bezier.

Once the Bezier buffer has been allocated the code parses the native buffer by
starting at the first TTPOLYGONHEADER. During an iteration of the loop the code
processes one contour and draws it. A Second inner loop parses each curve type.

In the case of a polyline curve (TT_PRIM_LINE), each line segment of the polyline
is converted and appended to the list of Beziers with the AppendPolyLineToBezier
function. If the curve is a Quadratic B-Spline (TT_PRIM_QSPLINE), the
AppendQuadBSplineToBezier function converts and appends the Quadratic B-Spline.
Each of these functions uses a loop to parse out each segment of the curve into
its independent control points. Then the line or spline is converted to a Bezier
and appended to the list of Beziers.

A Bezier line can draw a straight line easily. The start and ending vectors
simply point at the opposite end of the line segment. This is done in the
MakeBezierFromLine function.

To convert a quadratic spline into a cubic Bezier spline requires expressing the
cubic's control points in terms of the quadratic's control points. The equation
to translate the control points is located in the MakeBezierFromQBSpline
function.

Before drawing the contour, the code ensures that the path is closed by calling
the CloseContour function. The function is called only if the start and end
points of the sequence of Beziers are not coincident. Then the PolyBezier
function is called.

After the contour is drawn, the next contour's TTPOLYGONHEADER is found by
advancing the lpHeader pointer beyond the end of the records in the current
contour. If this results in a pointer value beyond the end of the native buffer,
the code has processed all of the contours and exits.
