- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

After you replace a failed hard disk, or change drives (different SCSI ID or
physical location in a SCSI rack) for the shared disk resource, the Cluster
service may not start. Also, the following error message may be displayed in the
Event log:

  Event ID: 1034
  Source: ClusDisk
  Description: The disk associated with cluster disk resource
  &lt;DriveLetter&gt; could not be found. The expected signature of the disk
  was &lt;DiskSignature&gt;.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because the Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS) server relies
on disk signatures to identify and mount volumes. If a hard disk is replaced or
the bus is re-enumerated, MSCS may not find the disk signatures that it is
expecting, and consequently may fail to mount the disk.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
To resolve this issue:

1. Backup the Servers Configuration:

   - Update your Emergency Repair disk (ERD) on each node. To do so, click
     Start, click Run, type "RDISK" (without the quotation marks), and then
     click OK.

2. Disable the Cluster Service on both Nodes:

  a. On BOTH nodes change the Startup value to Manual for the following items:

      - Clusdisk (by using the Devices tool in Control Panel)
      - Cluster Service (by using the Services tool in Control Panel)

NOTE: Do not attempt to stop the Clusdisk resource. If you do, you receive the
following error message:

  Error 2191: The requested pause or stop is not valid for this service

  b. Restart node 2.

      - At the OS Loader Boot menu, press SPACEBAR to pause the boot process
        and prevent Windows NT from loading.

     NOTE: This is necessary to maintain termination on the shared SCSI bus on
     some hardware configurations.

  c. Restart node 1 (and allow it to boot completely).

     NOTE: It is assumed at this point that you have replaced the failed hard
     disk in the shared resource. It is also assumed that you have followed the
     necessary steps to configure the hard disk to permit Windows NT to
     recognize it upon restarting.

3. Configure the New Disk:

  a. Start Disk Administrator (Windisk.exe) on node 1.

  b. Partition the new drive.

  c. Format the partition with the NTFS file system.

  d. Assign a drive letter and label to the partition.

4. Gather Information about your Disks:

  a. Start FTEdit.exe (included in the Microsoft Windows NT or 2000 Resource
     Kit).

  b. Obtain the disk signature information for all the hard disks.

  c. Document which disk signature belongs to each partition label.

     NOTE: At this point, there are probably 2 disk signatures for the hard disk
     that you are replacing. For example, if you are replacing disk W:, you see
     two separate entries in Ftedit for disk W:, each with its own disk
     signature. One signature is the original disk, the second signature is the
     new replacement.

For additional information about the Ftedit.exe tool, click the article number
below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q149927 FTedit.exe: What You Can and Can't Use It For

5. Gather Information about your Disk Resources:

  a. Start the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

  b. Open the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive, and then click on the root
     (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE) to select it.

  c. On the Registry menu, click Load Hive.

  d. Locate the %SystemRoot%\Cluster folder, and then click CLUSDB. When you
     are prompted for a key name, type "Cluster" (without the quotation marks).

  e. Locate the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Cluster\Resources\&lt;GUID&gt;\Parameters\Signature

      - Under each GUID, look for a TYPE value that is Physical Disk. After you
        identify all the physical disks, verify the Name key. It should have a
        value of "Disk &lt;DriveLetter&gt;". This is how you can identify which
        GUID belongs to which physical disk resource.

     NOTE: Each resource is listed by its Globally Unique Identifier (GUID). The
     GUID has 32 alpha numeric values with the following format:
     "x11xx1x1-x11x-11x1-xxx1-11111xxx111x".

  f. Document which disk signature belongs to each physical disk resource.

6. Update the Disk information in the Cluster Registry:

  a. Compare the disk signatures for each hard disk that you observed using the
     FTEdit.exe tool (step 4) with the disk resource signature values in the
     Cluster registry (step 5).

  b. The disk signature from FTEdit that is not the same as the one listed in
     the Signature key is the correct new disk signature.

  c. Document the correct disk signature for each disk.

  d. Replace the information in the Signature key in the Cluster registry with
     the correct disk signature value for the new disk. Make sure to make the
     changes in Hex.

  e. Locate the following registry key for the disk that is being replaced:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Cluster\Resources\&lt;GUID&gt;\Parameters\DiskInfo

     NOTE: The data type for the DiskInfo key should be REG_BINARY, and should
     be located directly above the Signatures key that was modified earlier in
     this article.

  f. Delete the DiskInfo registry key.

     NOTE: Make sure to delete the entire key, and not just the value for the
     key. This key is dynamically re-created the next time the Cluster service
     is started.

  g. Select the Cluster hive, then on the Registry menu, click Unload Hive.

7. Remove the Disk Signature Information for the Cluster Disk driver:

  a. Locate and delete the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Clusdisk\Parameters\Signatures

     NOTE: There are several registry keys under the Signatures key. They are
     disk signatures for drives on the shared resource. This key and all
     subkeys are re-created the next time the Cluster service bring that disk
     resource online on that node.

  b. Quit Regedt32.exe.

8. Remove the Duplicate entry in the Disk Key:

  a. Start FTEdit.exe again.

  b. Locate and then click the disk signature for the old disk (determined in
     step 6).

  c. Click Edit, and then click Delete Drive.

  d. Quit Ftedit.exe, and then click Yes to save changes.

9. Create a Copy of the Cluster Registry:

   - Copy the Clusdb file located in the %SystemRoot%\Cluster folder to a
     floppy disk.

10. Remove the Cluster Registry on the Quorum drive:

   - Start Windows Explorer, go to the MSCS folder on the quorum drive and
     delete the Quolog.log file and all the "Chk&lt;xxx&gt;.tmp" files.

     NOTE: The Cluster registry is dynamically re-created on the Quorum drive
     when the Cluster Service starts.

11. Start the Cluster Service on Node 1:

  a. Change the following Startup values back to:

      - System for Clusdisk (by using the Devices tool in Control Panel)
      - Automatic for the Cluster Service (by using the Services tool in
        Control Panel)

  b. Manually start the Clusdisk driver.

  c. Manually start the Cluster service.

IMPORTANT: If the quorum drive is the drive that failed, you may need to start
the Cluster service by using the -FIXQUORUM switch and temporarily change the
drive that is the quorum drive.

  d. Verify on node 1 that Clusdisk and the Cluster service started correctly.
     Start Cluster Administrator and verify that all physical disk resources
     are online and that there is one for each volume on the shared disk.

12. Boot Node 2:

   - Keep node 1 on, and then start node 2.

     Reminder: Node 2 will fail to join the cluster because the Cluster Service
     is disabled.

13. Manually Synchronize the Cluster Registries:

   - Replace the %SystemRoot%\Cluster\Clusdb file on node 2 with the Clusdb
     file that you copied to the floppy from node 1.

     IMPORTANT: After the cluster service starts on node 1, it is impossible to
     copy this file without stopping the Cluster service and unloading it from
     the registry.

14. Remove the Disk Signature Information for the Cluster Disk driver on node 2:

   - Locate and delete the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Clusdisk\Parameters\Signatures

15. Remove the Duplicate entry in the Disk Key:

  a. Start FTEdit.exe again.

  b. Locate and then click the disk signature for the old disk (determined in
     step 6).

  c. Click Edit, and then click Delete Drive.

  d. Quit Ftedit.exe, and then click Yes to save changes.

16. Start the Cluster Service on Node 2:

  a. Change the following Startup values back to:

      - System for Clusdisk (by using the Devices tool in Control Panel)
      - Automatic for the Cluster service (by using the Services tool in
        Control Panel)

  b. Manually start the Clusdisk driver.

  c. Manually start the Cluster service.

  d. Verify that node 2 successfully joined the cluster by using Cluster
     Administrator. Verify that you are able to manually move the new hard disk
     resource back and forth between the two nodes. To do so, right-click the
     resource group the disk is in and then click Move Group. This option
     changes ownership of the resource group and all its contents to the other
     node.

Perform the Following Steps if the Previous Steps Did Not Resolve the Issue
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the event that the steps listed earlier in this article do not resolve your
issue, you may have corruption in the Disk key and it may be necessary to delete
it from the registry. The Disk key is dynamically re-created when Disk
Administrator is launched for the first time. The following procedure outlines
the steps you need to perform in addition to the previous steps.

NOTE: This process can take a significant amount of time and should only be used
if the previous procedure does not resolve your issue.

WARNING: Verify that there is no software fault tolerance on the systems.
Deleting the Disk key from the registry destroys all software fault-tolerant
sets, and all data on them is lost! Software fault tolerance includes disk
mirroring, disk duplexing, stripe sets with parity, and stripe sets without
parity. Any software fault tolerance on the system is local to the nodes in
addition software fault tolerance is not supported on cluster shared drives.

1. Backup your Configuration on Both Nodes:

  a. Start Disk Administrator (Windisk.exe), and save a copy of the disk
     configuration information for disaster recovery. To do so, click
     Configuration Save in the Partition drop-down list, and then quit Disk
     Administrator.

  b. Update your Emergency Repair disk (ERD). To do so, click Start, click Run,
     type "RDISK" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.

2. Disable the Cluster Service on both Nodes:

  a. On BOTH nodes change the Startup value to Manual for the following items:

      - Clusdisk (by using the Devices tool in Control Panel)
      - Cluster Service (by using the Services tool in Control Panel)

     NOTE: Do not attempt to stop the Clusdisk resource. If you do, you receive
     the following error message:

  Error 2191: The requested pause or stop is not valid for this service

  b. Restart node 2:

     At the OS Loader Boot menu, press the SPACEBAR to pause the boot process
     and prevent Windows NT from loading.

     NOTE: This is necessary to maintain termination on the shared SCSI bus on
     some hardware configurations).

  c. Restart node 1 (and allow it to boot completely).

NOTE: It is assumed at this point that you have replaced the failed hard disk in
the shared resource. It is also assumed that you have followed the necessary
steps to configure the hard disk to permit Windows NT to recognize it upon
restarting.

3. Label all Partitions:

  a. Start Windows Explorer.

  b. Right-click on the drive and click Properties.

  c. Type the partition drive letter in the Disk Label field under the General
     tab, and then click OK.

     NOTE: Label all hard disks with their current drive letters. For example,
     if disk R: is labeled "SQL Data", change the label so that disk R: is
     labeled "Disk R". This prevents confusion later after deleting the Disk
     key.

4. Re-create your Disk Configuration:

  a. Start the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

  b. Locate and then delete the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Disk

  c. Reboot node 1.

  d. Start Disk Administrator. You may receive a warning message that Disk
     Administrator is being run for the first time on this computer, and this
     message is expected.

  e. Change all partitions so that their drive letters match their labels.

     NOTE: It may be necessary to restart the computer several times in order to
     get all the drive letters changed back to the way they were.

  f. Partition and format the new disk and assign the same drive letter to it
     that the previous (failed) hard disk had.

  g. After all drive letters are correct, quit Disk Administrator.

5. Gather Information about your disks:

  a. Start Ftedit.exe.

  b. Document all of the disk signatures and their corresponding drive letters.

  c. Quit FTEdit.exe.

6. Update the Disk information in the Cluster Registry:

  a. Start the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

  b. Open the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive, and then click on the root
     (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE) to select it.

  c. On the Registry menu, click Load Hive.

  d. Locate the %SystemRoot%\Cluster folder, and then click CLUSDB. When you
     are prompted for a key name, type "Cluster" (without the quotation marks).

  e. Locate the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Cluster\Resources\&lt;GUID&gt;\Parameters\Signature

      - Under each GUID, look for a TYPE key that has a Physical Disk value.
        After you identify all the physical disks, verify the Name key. It
        should have a value of "Disk &lt;DriveLetter&gt;". This is how you can
        identify which GUID belongs to which physical disk resource.

     NOTE: Each resource is listed by its Globally Unique Identifier (GUID). The
     GUID has 32 alpha numeric values and will follow this format:
     x11xx1x1-x11x-11x1-xxx1-11111xxx111x.

  f. Compare the disk signatures for each disk that you observed by using the
     Ftedit.exe tool with the Signature values in the Cluster registry. When
     you locate the hard disk that you are replacing, make a note of the old
     signature value (you will need it later). Replace the disk signature
     information with the new hard disk's signature that you obtained from
     Ftedit.exe.

  g. Locate the following registry key for the hard disk that you replaced:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Cluster\Resources\&lt;GUID&gt;\Parameters\DiskInfo

      - The data type for the DiskInfo key is REG_BINARY. This key should be
        directly above the Parameters key that you modified earlier in this
        article.

  h. Delete the DiskInfo key. This key is dynamically re-created the next time
     the cluster service is started.

  i. Select the Cluster hive, then on the Registry menu, click Unload Hive.

7. Remove the Disk Signature Information for the Cluster Disk driver:

  a. Locate and delete the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Clusdisk\Parameters\Signatures

     NOTE: There are several registry keys under the Signatures key. They are
     disk signatures for drives on the shared resource. This key and all
     subkeys are re-created the next time the Cluster service bring that disk
     resource online on that node.

  b. Quit Regedt32.exe.

8. Remove the Cluster Registry on the Quorum drive:

   - Start Windows Explorer, go to the MSCS folder on the quorum drive and
     delete the Quolog.log file and all the Chk&lt;xxx&gt;.tmp files.

NOTE: The Cluster registry will be dynamically re-created on the Quorum drive
when the Cluster Service starts. For additional information, click the article
