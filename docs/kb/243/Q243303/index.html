-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a Windows NT-based computer with at least two disk volumes, opening Recycle
Bin may take several seconds if access to one or more of the disk volumes has
been locked using a third-party service.

CAUSE
=====

When Recycle Bin is opened, it attempts to open the current user's Recycler
folder on each available volume. A problem with the Windows NT shell causes it
to pause and retry the open operation several times if access to the volumes is
denied. This can lead to a delay of several seconds.


RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
