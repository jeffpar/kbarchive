The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition

SYMPTOMS
========

When you pass random data to some of the functions in the Windows NT 4.0 print
spooler sub-system Application Programming Interface (API) that have unchecked
buffers, the print spooler service may stop responding (hang). If the affected
API is provided with a specially-malformed argument, it may be possible to
bypass the computer security settings and run an unauthorized program using a
buffer overrun technique.

The majority of the affected APIs require that the user be a member of the Power
Users or Administrators group. However, at least one API is callable by users
that have not been assigned extended security permissions. The calls can also be
made remotely.

RESOLUTION
