==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, follow these steps on the Systems Management Server site
server:

1. Replace the Inv32cli.exe file in the
  &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\&lt;Platform&gt;.bin folder
  with the hotfix version.

2. Replace the Invwin32.exe file in the
  &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\&lt;Platform&gt;.bin folder
  with the hotfix version.

3. Replace the Invwin32.exe file in the
  &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Site.srv\&lt;Platform&gt;.bin folder with the hotfix
  version.

4. Maintenance Manager replicates the updated files to the Systems Management
  Server logon servers on its next work cycle. To update the clients, either
  manually run Upgrade.bat on each client or follow the instructions in the
  following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q166771 SMS: How to Force Site-Wide Client Updates

5. A site reset is required for Invwin32.exe (SMS_INVENTORY_AGENT_NT) to be
  copied to all servers managed by Site Configuration Manager. You can manually
  perform this process by stopping the SMS_INVENTORY_AGENT_NT service on each
  server and replacing the Invwin32.exe file in the
  &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Helper.srv\&lt;Platform&gt;.bin folder with the hotfix
  version.
