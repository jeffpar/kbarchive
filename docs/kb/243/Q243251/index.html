SYMPTOMS
========

If the specified screen saver is set to use password protection, but the screen
saver does not exist on the computer, the computer is not locked when the screen
saver time-out occurs. Users can still start programs.

At this point, pressing CTRL+ALT+DELETE does not display the Windows Security
dialog box. Instead, the workstation is locked and displays the Unlock Windows
dialog box.
