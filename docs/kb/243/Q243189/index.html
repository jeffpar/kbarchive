-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you open Control Panel on a computer that is a Systems Management Server
(SMS) 2.0 client, "%SMS_LOCAL_DIR%\MS\CORE\BIN" is added to your path. However,
closing Control Panel does not remove the entry. Each time you open Control
Panel, another instance of "%SMS_LOCAL_DIR%\MS\CORE\BIN" is added to the path.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, rename the SMS Control Panel (.cpl) files in the
System32 folder.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix:

1. Copy the Q243189.exe file from the disk on which you received it to a share
  on your network. This is an SMS Installer file that updates specific files on
  your site server.

2. Log on to your site server using an account with administrative privileges.

3. On the site server, close the SMS Administrator console.

4. Run the executable file that you copied in step 1 and follow the directions
  in the wizard.

NOTE: The default Client Configuration Installation Manager (CCIM) polling
interval is 23 hours. Therefore, it may take up to 23 hours for the hotfixed
files to be propagated to the clients. To speed up this process, you can stop
and restart the SMS Client Service on each client. You can also create a
software distribution for one of the Resource Kit tools Setevnt.exe or
Cliutils.exe along with the appropriate parameter(s) to start a CCIM work cycle.
For information on the proper syntax to use with these tools, see the Resource
Kit documentation.
