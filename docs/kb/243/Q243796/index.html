SUMMARY
=======

This article describes persistent verification authentication when LU6.2
connectivity is employed for mainframe communications.

In the COM Transaction Integrator (COMTI) Remote Environment Security properties,
a user may choose to "Allow the application to override the selected
authentication." Additionally, a user may opt to "Use Already Verified or
Persistent Verification authentication". (Properties on the mainframe determine
which of the two, Already Verified or Persistent Verification, will be used.
This is settled at the time a LU 6.2 session is bound.)

Persistent Verification authentication means that after a session is bound, the
first transaction request (ATTACH) must contain both a user ID and a password.
Subsequent ATTACHes on that session need only the user ID. On the mainframe, a
security check is required only the first time so that there is a reduction in
the mainframe overhead of security-checking for the subsequent transaction
requests.

Despite this, when the client is using application override security, the client
callback mechanism must supply both a user ID and the password for every
transaction. The rationale for this requirement is that it precludes a security
risk: It is considered too easy to guess mainframe user IDs, which is a problem
when no password is required. Nevertheless, SNA Server sends the password on
only the first ATTACH for a given session.

MORE INFORMATION
================

COMTI cannot tell which mode of security has been negotiated between the partner
LUs nor whether the present transaction is the first for the given LU 6.2 APPC
session. Therefore, the application must always supply both the user ID and
password.
