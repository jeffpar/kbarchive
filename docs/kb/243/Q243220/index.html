-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
- Microsoft Windows 98 
- Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5 on a computer running
Windows 95 or Windows 98, or if you are running Windows 98 Second Edition, you
may receive the following error message from COM Internet Services:

  The remote server machine does not exist or is unavailable (Error 462)

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you clear the "Bypass proxy server for local intranet
access" check box in Internet Explorer options.

In Internet Explorer 4.x, clearing the "Bypass proxy server for local internet
access" check box sets the following registry value to null:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet
  Settings\ProxyOverride

In Internet Explorer 5, the ProxyOverride value is deleted. The Remote Procedure
Call (RPC) protocol flags an error condition when it cannot find the
ProxyOverride key in the registry.

==========
