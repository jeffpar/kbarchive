SUMMARY
=======

The "More Information" section of this article contains contents from the
Internet Information Services 5.0 RC2 Release Notes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Internet Services
-----------------

The following sections describe Windows 2000 issues related to Internet services
features.

Internet Information Services

To obtain the most recent information about installation, documentation, and
other known Internet Information Services (IIS) issues, type the following into
the address bar of your browser (or click Start, click Run, and type the
following):

  file:\\%Systemroot%\Help\Iishelp\Iis\Htm\Core\Readme.htm

Where %systemroot% is your Windows 2000 installation path, including drive and
directory (for example, C:\Winnt).

IIS is not installed by default on Windows 2000 Professional. If you cannot view
the IIS Release Notes from the link above, you need to install IIS by using
Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel.

If you previously installed Windows 2000 without IIS, you can install it through
Control Panel Add/Remove Programs by clicking the Add/Remove Windows Components
button. Do not use the Autorun utility on the Windows 2000 compact disc.

Requiring 128-Bit Encryption on a 56-Bit Server

If you select the Require 128-bit encryption check box on a server that is only
capable of 56-bit encryption, users cannot access resources for which this
requirement is selected. Even though the Require 128-bit encryption check box is
selected, only 56-bit encryption is used. To enable access to these resources,
clear the check box.

Using Clustered Host Header Sites

If you are using clustered Web sites with host headers, you must set the
ServerAutoStart metabase property type to True for these sites. To set the
ServerAutoStart metabase property type to True, type the following at the
command prompt:

  

  %SystemDrive%\inetpub\adminscripts\adsutil.vbs set w3svc/&lt;instance id&gt;/ServerAutoStart True

The &lt;instance id&gt; is the instance ID for the virtual host sites that are
part of the cluster.

Problems Accessing FrontPage Webs after Upgrading to the FrontPage 2000 Server
Extensions

If you upgrade to the FrontPage 2000 Server Extensions and then experience
problems accessing FrontPage Webs, review the permissions for all of your
FrontPage Web sites. If any changes are required, update the permissions in
FrontPage to ensure that changes are made correctly.

Server Certificate Cannot be Removed and Reassigned after Upgrade

After you upgrade to Windows 2000, you may be unable to remove and reassign your
server certificate. This issue is caused by changes in the way that IIS uses
server certificates. As a workaround, use the following Visual Basic script to
change metabase settings and remove the certificate:

  

  'Set Machinename to the name of the machine or localhost
  Set PathObj = GetObject("IIS://" &amp; MachineName &amp; "/w3svc")
  PathObj.PutEx 1, "SSLCertHash", ""
  PathObj.PutEx 1, "SSLStoreName", ""
  PathObj.Setinfo

You can then use the Web Site Certificate wizard in IIS to reassign the
certificate. This will be addressed in a future release.
