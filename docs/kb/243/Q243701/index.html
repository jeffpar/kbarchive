SYMPTOMS
========

When you restart the message transfer agent (MTA), the Microsoft Mail Connector
interchange may log the following event ID 2450 and 2380 error messages, which
indicate that a message could not be delivered:

  Event ID 2380

  A memory access violation has occurred that prevents further processing of a
  message. The access violation that occurred is an attempt to read from 0x1.
  Please refer to the immediately following event(s) logged by MS Mail
  Connector Interchange for more information on the message that could not be
  processed. (Exception address: %2.)

  Event ID 2450

  message is left in the delivery queue. Use the MS Exchange Administrator to

  MS Connector is restarted if the message is not removed from the queue.
