SUMMARY
=======

This article shows how to limit an application to one instance. It does not rely
on any creation of windows, so the method used in this article could be used for
about any 32-bit application that is developed in C++. This includes console
applications, WinCE applications, dialog box based applications, applications
without a graphical user interface and many others.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The method used in this article is the one described in MSDN under the WinMain
topic. It uses the CreateMutex() function to create a named mutex that can be
checked across processes. Instead of duplicating the same code for every
application that intends to be used as a single instance, the needed code is in
a C++ wrapper class that can be reused across each application.

In order to use this functionality, you can use the following steps:

1. Create a new header file with the name LimitSingleInstance.h and add it to
  your project.

2. Copy the following code into the LimitSingleInstance.h file and save the
  file.

  #ifndef LimitSingleInstance_H
  #define LimitSingleInstance_H

  #include &lt;windows.h&gt; 

  //this code is from Q243953 in case you lose the article and wonder
  //where this code came from...
  class CLimitSingleInstance
  {
  protected:
    DWORD  m_dwLastError;
    HANDLE m_hMutex;

  public:
    CLimitSingleInstance(TCHAR *strMutexName)
    {
      //be sure to use a name that is unique for this application otherwise
      //two apps may think they are the same if they are using same name for
      //3rd parm to CreateMutex
      m_hMutex = CreateMutex(NULL, FALSE, strMutexName); //do early
      m_dwLastError = GetLastError(); //save for use later...
    }
     
    ~CLimitSingleInstance() 
    {
      if (m_hMutex)  //don't forget to close handles...
      {
         CloseHandle(m_hMutex); //do as late as possible
         m_hMutex = NULL; //good habit to be in
      }
    }

    BOOL IsAnotherInstanceRunning() 
    {
      return (ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS == m_dwLastError);
    }
  };
  #endif

3. #include the LimitSingleInstance.h file where the entry point of the program
  is located. If this is to be used in an MFC Application, it is the file where
  the InitInstance() function for the application is located. In a Win32 SDK
  application, it is where the WinMain() function is located. In a console
  application, it is where the main() function is located.

  #include "LimitSingleInstance.H"

4. Create a global instance of the CLimitSingleInstance class before the entry
  point function. If this is being used in a MFC application, create the
  instance before the InitInstance() function.

5. Pass a unique name to the constructor of the global CLimitSingleInstance
  instance. It is recommended to use a unique name so another application that
  may be using this article will not conflict when doing the duplicate
  checking. An easy way to get a unique name that no one else will have is to
  use the GUIDGEN tool. You can access the tool by typing "GUIDGEN" (without
  the quotation marks) from the Start button and then select Run in Windows. If
  for some reason you do not have the tool, the tool is provided as a sample in
  MSDN. Type in GUIDGEN in the MSDN index to find it. Be sure to use the
  Registry Format option in the GUIDGEN tool.

  #include "LimitSingleInstance.H"

  // The one and only CLimitSingleInstance object
  // Change what is passed to constructor. GUIDGEN Tool may be of help.
  CLimitSingleInstance g_SingleInstanceObj(TEXT("{719967F0-DCC6-49b5-9C61-DE91175C3187}"));

6. In your entry point function, call the IsAnotherInstanceRunning() method on
  the global instance of the CLimitSingleInstance class and check the return
  value. If the function returns TRUE, return from the entry point function.
  Otherwise, continue execution as normal.

  In an MFC Application, you could do something like the following:

  #include "LimitSingleInstance.H"

  // The one and only CLimitSingleInstance object
  CLimitSingleInstance g_SingleInstanceObj(TEXT("{05CA3573-B449-4e0b-83F5-7FD612E378E9}"));

  BOOL CSingleInstDlg5App::InitInstance()
  {
      if (g_SingleInstanceObj.IsAnotherInstanceRunning())
         return FALSE; 

  //rest of code
  }

  In a Console Application, you could do something like the following:

  #include "LimitSingleInstance.H"

  // The one and only CLimitSingleInstance object
  CLimitSingleInstance g_SingleInstanceObj(TEXT("{9DA0BEED-7248-450a-B27C-C0409BDC377D}"));

  int main(int argc, char* argv[])
  {
      if (g_SingleInstanceObj.IsAnotherInstanceRunning())
         return 0;
  //rest of code
  }

  In a Win32 SDK Application, you could do something like the following:

  #include "LimitSingleInstance.H"

  // The one and only CLimitSingleInstance object
  CLimitSingleInstance g_SingleInstanceObj(TEXT("{2194ABA1-BFFA-4e6b-8C26-D191BB16F9E6}"));

  int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance, LPSTR lpCmdLine, int cmdShow)
  {
      if (g_SingleInstanceObj.IsAnotherInstanceRunning())
         return FALSE; 
  //rest of code
  }

After following the above steps, the application will not allow more than one
instance to remain active at one time.
