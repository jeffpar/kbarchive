The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Application Converter for Lotus Notes is comprised of the
Connection Manager for administrators and the Application Converter for
developers.

Replication requirements and the type of application being converted determine
which program to use. Use the Connection Manager to move data in production
environments or on an ongoing basis, and for simple Notes applications, such as
discussions, as well as the Notes template-based applications: Customer
Tracking, Status Reports, News, and Document Libraries. For more complex Notes
applications where customizing is often required, you must use the Application
Converter. You can also use the Application Converter when conversion does not
require periodic synchronization.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Connection Manager for Administrators
-------------------------------------

With this Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in, administrators can create
and manage connections, and migrate standard Notes applications.

Replication Service
The Connection Manager includes a Replication Service that automatically migrates
Notes data to Exchange Server public folders or personal folders. This is a
Windows NT service.

Application Converter for Developers
------------------------------------

The Application Converter enables developers to:

- Establish connections. Connections are pairings of Notes databases with
  Exchange Server personal folders or public folders for transferring data.

- Automatically convert Notes application designs to Outlook forms and views.

- Develop custom Outlook forms with the included ActiveX controls customized so
  that Outlook can duplicate Notes functionality. The controls are Radio Button
  List, Checkbox List, Keyword List, Image, and Frame.

- Perform a test or one-time migration of data from Notes to Exchange Server.

- Export the connections and the application information to a file for import
  by an administrator.

The Exchange Application Converter for Lotus Notes does not support Notes version
5. Application support for Notes 5 is currently being reviewed, and may be
released in a future product.
