-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 Professional Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000, you may experience one or more of
the following symptoms:

- The joystick behaves erratically.

- The joystick does not respond.

- The rudder or throttle does not respond.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following troubleshooting methods in the order in
which they are presented. After each method, test to see if the issue is
resolved. If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

NOTE: If you use a Logitech Warrior joystick, connect it to the game port. Do not
connect it to the serial port. The Logitech Warrior does not function properly
with Microsoft DirectX 5.0 or later when it is connected to a serial port.

Because the Logitech Warrior is not listed in the Devices.cfg file, Flight
Simulator 2000 may not assign any actions to the buttons on the joystick, or it
may configure the Logitech Warrior as a generic joystick.

Verify That Your Operating System Supports Your Game Controller
---------------------------------------------------------------

To enable support for the game port in Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, you must install
Service Pack 3 (SP3) or later. Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 with SP3 or later
supports most analog game controllers. However, it does not support digital game
controllers.

Microsoft Windows 95/98 supports both analog and digital game controllers. For
best performance, verify that the latest version of the game controller driver
for your game controller is installed on your computer.

The following table contains an operating system compatibility list for Microsoft
SideWinder game controllers:

* Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 3 or later only supports the SideWinder 3DPro
joystick in analog mode.

** You can install and run version 4.0 of the SideWinder software on a Windows
2000-based computer. However, all features may not function as expected, and the
SideWinder software may not function properly. To install the SideWinder
software on Windows 2000, you must log on as an administrator.

*** To use a hybrid game port/Universal Serial Bus (USB) game controller with a
Windows 95-based computer, you must connect the game controller to the game port
in your computer. Windows 95 does not support USB.

NOTE: Unless otherwise indicated in the preceding table, support for all current
USB/game port and USB-only SideWinder game controllers is included in Windows
98, Windows Me, and Windows 2000.

Check the Game Controller Connection to the Game Port
-----------------------------------------------------

If you use a game port game controller, verify that the game controller is
connected directly to the game port in your computer. Daisy-chained game
controllers or game port adapters can interfere with communication between the
game port and the game controller.

If you use a Universal Serial Bus (USB) game controller, verify that the game
controller is connected properly to the USB port in your computer or to a
combatable USB hub that is connected to the USB port in your computer.

NOTE: Windows NT 4.0 does not support daisy-chained game controllers, game port
adapters, or USB game controllers.

Disable the SideWinder Game Device Profiler
-------------------------------------------

If you use a SideWinder game controller, disable the SideWinder Game Device
Profiler or SideWinder Game Controller software. To do this, right-click the
Game Device Profiler icon or the Game Controller Software icon in the status
area on the taskbar, and then click Unload or Disable.

Confirm That Your Game Controller Is Assigned to Controller ID 1
----------------------------------------------------------------

Many games do not recognize game controllers that are not assigned to Controller
ID 1. To verify that your game controller is assigned to Controller ID 1:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Game Controllers.

3. Click the Advanced tab.

4. If the game controller you want to use is not assigned to ID 1, click
  Change.

  If the game controller you want to use is assigned to ID 1, proceed to the
  next method.

5. In the Game Controllers box, click the game controller you want to use, and
  then click the UP ARROW or DOWN ARROW to change the Selected ID value to 1.

6. Click OK, and then click OK again.

7. Close Control Panel.

Confirm the Version of SideWinder Game Controller Software
----------------------------------------------------------

If you use a SideWinder USB-only game controller, verify that the SideWinder Game
Controller Software version 4.0 is installed on your computer.

If you use a game port-only or a hybrid game port/USB game controller, verify
that version 3.02 or earlier of the SideWinder Game Device Profiler or the
SideWinder Game Controller software is installed on your computer.

If you use both SideWinder USB-only game controllers and SideWinder game port or
hybrid game port/USB game controllers, make sure that versions 4.0 and 3.02 or
earlier of the SideWinder Game Controller software are installed on your
computer.

The following table lists the SideWinder game controllers that are supported by
each version of the SideWinder Game Controller software:

  
  +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Game controller                 | Version 4.0   | Version 3.02 or earlier | 
  +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | SideWinder Game Pad Pro         | Supported     | Not supported           | 
  +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | SideWinder Dual Strike          | Supported     | Not supported           | 
  +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | SideWinder 3D Pro               | Not supported | Supported               | 
  +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | SideWinder Freestyle Pro        | Not supported | Supported               | 
  +---------------------------------------------------------------------------+

If you are using one of the SideWinder game controllers listed above, visit the
following Microsoft Web site to see if a software update is available for your
game controller:

  http://www.microsoft.com/sidewinder/

Calibrate the Game Controller
-----------------------------

If you use a digital Microsoft SideWinder game controller with version 2.0 or
later of the Microsoft SideWinder Game Device software or the Microsoft
SideWinder Game Controller software, the software calibrates the game controller
automatically.

To use version 2.0 of the Microsoft SideWinder Game Device software to test the
calibration for your digital SideWinder game controller:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Game Controllers.

3. On the Test tab, test all of the functions for your digital SideWinder game
  controller, and then click OK.

4. Close Control Panel.

To use version 3.x or 4.0 of the Microsoft SideWinder Game Controller software to
test the calibration for your digital SideWinder game controller:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Game Controllers.

3. On the General tab, click the game controller you want to test in the Game
  Controllers box, and then click Properties.

4. On the Test tab, test all of the functions for your digital SideWinder game
  controller, click OK, and then click OK again.

5. Close Control Panel.

If you use an analog game controller, or if you use a Microsoft SideWinder 3D Pro
or a Microsoft SideWinder game pad with version 1.5 of the SideWinder Game
Device software, you may need to calibrate the game controller manually. To do
this:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Game Controllers.

3. Select the gaming device you want to calibrate in the Controller column, and
  then click Properties.

4. Click Calibrate, and then follow the instructions on the screen to calibrate
  the game controller. If you use a SideWinder 3D Pro with version 1.0 of the
  SideWinder software, when you are prompted to press a button on the
  controller, press a button on the joystick, not on the joystick base.

  NOTE: Because of differences between analog game controllers, you may notice a
  certain amount of deviation between the graphic display for the joystick
  position and the actual joystick movement. This is normal and does not affect
  the callibration of the game controller.

5. When you receive the "You have successfully calibrated your device" message,
  click Finish.

6. On the Test tab, test all of the functions for your game controller, and then
  click OK.

7. Close Control Panel.

NOTE: No calibration option is available in version 1.5 of the SideWinder Game
Device software unless you install Flight Simulator 98 with DirectX 5.0.

If you cannot calibrate your game controller, or if your game controller does not
function properly when you test it, Microsoft Windows may be unable to
communicate properly with the game controller. If this is true, contact the
manufacturer of your game controller for information about how to configure the
device correctly in Windows. You may also need to obtain and install the latest
version of the game controller device driver.

If you calibrate and test the game controller successfully, start Flight
Simulator 2000 to test the game controller in the game. If the issue continues
to occur, calibrate the device in Flight Simulator 2000. To do this:

1. Start a new flight in Flight Simulator 2000.

2. On the Options menu, point to Controls, and then click Calibrate Joystick.

  NOTE: If Calibrate Joystick is unavailable, click Enable Joystick, and then
  repeat this step.

3. In the Game Controllers box on the General tab, click the game controller you
  want to use, and then click Properties.

4. On the Settings tab, move the sliders to the settings you want.

5. Click OK, and then click OK again.

Reset the Default Actions
-------------------------

To reset the default actions assigned to the game controller:

1. Start a new flight in Flight Simulator 2000.

2. On the Options menu, point to Controls, and then click Assignments.

3. In the "Joystick type" box on the Buttons/Keys tab, click the game controller
  you want to use, and then click Reset Defaults.

4. Click the "Joystick axes" tab.

5. In the "Joystick type" box, click the game controller you want to use, and
  then click Reset Defaults.

6. To check if the default events are selected for your 4-axis game controller,
  verify that the Axis settings for each Event match the settings in the
  following table:

  
  +-------------------------+
  | Event         | Axis    | 
  +-------------------------+
  | Elevator axis | Axis 02 | 
  +-------------------------+
  | Ailerons axis | Axis 01 | 
  +-------------------------+
  | Rudder axis   | Axis 04 | 
  +-------------------------+
  | Throttle axis | Axis 03 | 
  +-------------------------+

  If the default events are not selected, proceed to the "Manually Assign
  Actions" method in part 2 of this article to assign the default events
  manually.

  To view part 2 of this article, click the article number below:

  Q244515 Flight Simulator 2000: Troubleshooting Joystick Problems (Part 2)

  If the default event is assigned to an axis, but the event behaves in reverse
  (for example, up instead of down, or right instead of left), click to select
  or clear the check box under the Reverse column for that axis.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Rebuild the Fs2000.cfg File
---------------------------

To rebuild the Fs2000.cfg file, press and hold down CTRL+SHIFT as you start
Flight Simulator 2000 and start a new flight. Continue to hold down CTRL+SHIFT
until you are in Cockpit view.

NOTE: When you rebuild the Fs2000.cfg file, some of your joystick settings may
change.

If your game controller is installed properly and the Devices.cfg file contains
the default settings for your game controller, Flight Simulator 2000 adds the
appropriate entries for your game controller to the Fs2000.cfg file.

The Devices.cfg file contains the following joystick headings:
