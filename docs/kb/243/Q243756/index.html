SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows 2000 employs a security technology named Encrypting File
System (EFS), which enables users to encrypt and decrypt files. Windows users
can utilize EFS to keep sensitive files safe from unauthorized access. This
article summarizes how to use this technology to encrypt personal Web documents
for additional security.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: EFS will fail encryption attempts on files with the System attribute.
Administrators should not attempt to defeat this safeguard to encrypt files in
the system directory. The private keys needed for decryption are not available
during the boot process. Therefore, a system will be rendered unusable if its
system files are encrypted. Future releases of Windows may provide secure boot
capabilities that support encryption of system files.


EFS is enabled for documents in Windows 2000 through an optional advanced file
attribute. To implement this feature, follow these steps:

1. In Windows Explorer, create a new folder named SecureTest in the root folder
  for your Web site.

2. In the new folder, save the following Active Server Pages (ASP) code as
  Default.asp:

  <span class="nt">&lt;html&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
  You are logged on as:
  "<span class="nt">&lt;b&gt;&lt;</span><span class="err">%=</span><span class="na">Request</span><span class="err">.</span><span class="na">ServerVariables</span><span class="err">("</span><span class="na">LOGON_USER</span><span class="err">")%</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</span>"
  <span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>

3. Right-click the Default.asp file and then click Properties.

4. Click Advanced.

5. Select the Encrypt contents to secure data check box.

6. Click OK.

7. If you are prompted to encrypt the parent folder, select the Encrypt the file
  only radio button and then click OK.

8. Click OK again to return to Windows Explorer.

When you browse to the http://<span class="nt">&lt;servername&gt;</span>/SecureTest/default.asp page, the
page requires authentication and your user name is displayed, even if anonymous
authentication is enabled for the entire Web site. This is because files that
are encrypted with EFS are private files, and only the user that encrypted the
files can browse to them. The authentication method used may be Basic/Clear
Text, Windows Integrated, or Digest, depending on how the Web site is
configured.

The following is a list of best practices regarding EFS:

- Protect the private keys associated with data recovery certificates. Export
  them into a Personal Information Exchange (.pfx) file protected with a strong
  password. Store .pfx files on a floppy disk, and lock the floppy disk away
  for safekeeping.

- Encrypt folders rather than individual files. Explorer only allows encryption
  at the folder level. However, the Cipher.exe file can encrypt individual
  files. Applications work on files in various ways. For example, when a user
  edits a file with an application, the application may create temporary files
  in the same folder as the original. Encrypting at the folder level ensures
  that these temporary files are not created or saved as plain text.

- Encrypt the My Documents folder (%UserProfile%\My Documents) to ensure that
  the personal folder, in which most Microsoft Office documents are saved, is
  encrypted by default.

- Encrypt the Temp folder (%TEMP%) to ensure that the temporary files that are
  created by various applications are encrypted.
