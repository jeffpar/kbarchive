SUMMARY
=======

Exchange Server bridgeheads configured with a large number of site connectors
may experience occurrences of the following Event ID, and message backlogs are
likely to result:

  Event ID 9280
  MSExchangeMTA
  Warning
  A resource limit has been reached when attempting to open an association. The
  locality table is full.

The following Event ID is likely to be seen in conjunction with the occurrences
of Event ID 9280:

  Event ID 57
  MSExchangeMTA
  Warning
  The limit on the number of associations allowed to and from entity (X.500
  Distinguished Name referring to a remote server) has been reached. The limit
  is 9.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Event ID 9280 indicates that the message transfer agent (MTA) has reached its
limit for concurrent LAN-based MTA connections. Currently, this limit is
approximately 240 concurrent associations for each MTA.

Note that this limit relates only to bridgeheads which serve a large number of
remote procedure call (RPC)-based connectors, such as site connector. X.400
connections do not factor into this total concurrent association count for the
240 limitation. For additional information about Event ID 57 from the Exchange
Server MTA, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
