SYMPTOMS
========

Support for TN3287 clients has been added to Microsoft TN3270 Server.

STATUS
======

Support for TN3287 has been added to the TN3270 Server as a hotfix to SNA Server
2.11 Service Pack 1. This update is available on request from Microsoft.

MORE INFORMATION
================

TN3287 provides a different protocol for accessing printer clients, but there
are no changes to the TN3270 configuration. That is, if you have a TN3270 LU
configured to support printer clients it will support both TN3270E and TN3287
clients. So, when you configure the TN3270 Server, no special configuration is
required for TN3287 clients

RFC 1646 contains the following text on TN3287:

  The purpose of the TN3287 protocol is to provide a general IBM 3270 host
  printer communications facility. Its primary goal is to allow a method of
  connecting printer devices and printer-oriented processes to each other. This
  protocol will allow a TN3270 Client to process 3287 print data streams.

  The TN3287 Client is a TN3270 client created specifically to print mainframe
  3270 print data. The client emulates the IBM device type that it identifies
  itself to the TN3270 server as, in this case, an IBM 3287 model 1 type
  printer. The design of this printer protocol is aligned with the way printing
  occurs in the IBM host and how 3270 printers function. These printer
  extensions DO NOT support a 3270 printer client that cannot accept both types
  LU1 and LU3 printer streams.

Support for the TN3287 data stream requires that both sides:

- Are able to exchange binary data.

- Can establish the agreement between client and server on the terminal type
  that will be used.

- Agree to use the TELNET IAC EOR as a delimiter for inbound and outbound
  TN3287 data streams

This implementation requires the options: TERMINAL-TYPE and BINARY be
successfully negotiated between the Client and Server before processing of any
print data streams. The LU type is determined by the bind from the mainframe
application. The server, when bound, must remember LU 1 or LU 3 type. The server
will automatically unbind the session upon receipt of a TELNET CLOSE command.
The printer will be reported to VTAM as powered down until a new TELNET
connection is established.
