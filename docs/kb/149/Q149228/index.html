SUMMARY
=======

The default settings for the mouse have acceleration enabled. To disable
acceleration in the Mouse Control Panel tool, you can move the Mouse Speed slide
bar all the way to the left. However, this makes the mouse pointer move very
slowly in relation to the movement of the mouse. Disabling acceleration is
desirable for some users of Windows NT, such as CAD users, but making the
default mouse speed the only speed is impractical.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To calculate the mouse speed under Windows NT, three settings are used: Mouse
Speed, MouseThreshold1, and MouseThreshold2.

Mouse Speed sets the relationship between mouse and cursor movement when the
value of either MouseThreshold1 or MouseThreshold2 is exceeded. When this
occurs, cursor movement accelerates according to the value of MouseSpeed.

MouseThreshold1 and MouseThreshold2 set the maximum number of pixels the mouse
can move between mouse interrupts before the system alters the relationship
between mouse and cursor movement. If the mouse movement exceeds the threshold
defined by MouseThreshold1 and if MouseSpeed is greater than 0, the system moves
the cursor at twice the normal speed. If the mouse movement exceeds the
threshold defined by MouseThreshold2 and if MouseSpeed is 2, the system moves
the cursor at four times the normal speed.

Using the slide bar in the Mouse Control Panel tool, you cannot disable
acceleration without making the mouse pointer respond very slowly to the mouse
movements. It is possible to overcome this limitation by manually setting the
MouseThreshold settings so low that any movement at all is accelerated. Mouse
pointer speed will no longer increase factorially with an increase in mouse
movement, but still moves at a rate higher than normal.

  WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system- wide
  problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
  Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
  Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

To implement a higher default mouse pointer speed for the currently logged in
user, use the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) to edit the following registry
key:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Mouse

1. Set the value of MouseThreshold1 to 0.

2. Set the value of MouseThreshold2 to 0.

3. Set the value of MouseSpeed to 1 or 2 (1 doubles the normal speed, 2
  quadruples the normal speed).

4. Close Registry Editor, close all applications, and restart Windows NT.
