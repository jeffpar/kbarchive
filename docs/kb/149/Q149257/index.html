- The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The SPLIT32 sample demonstrates the following Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC)
programming concepts:

1. A ReplaceView() function can be created which replaces a view in a
  CSplitterWnd pane with another. The function replaces a view but uses the
  same CDocument object. This function can be helpful if a programmer wants to
  keep the same frame window and document for a splitter pane, and only wants
  to delete a view in a pane and replace it with another.

2. The CDocument variable m_bAutoDelete can be used to prevent the destruction
  of a CDocument object if all views of the document are destroyed.

3. The CWnd::PreCreateWindow() function can be used to prevent the main
  application from having a thick frame, thus preventing the user from resizing
  the main application window.

4. By trapping the WM_SETCURSOR, WM_MOUSEMOVE, and WM_LBUTTONDOWN messages of a
  CSplitterWnd, you can fix the splitter bars in a splitter window so that they
  can't be moved by the user.

5. CSplitterWnd panes can contain regular CWnd objects and are not limited to
  the use of CViews. This sample places a dialog in the first pane.

6. CWnd::CenterWindow() can be used to position windows at the center of the
  screen.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: The following Microsoft Software Library samples, which also replace
various views, are also available:

- VWRPLC32 (MDI)

- COLLECT (MDI)

- ENROLL (SDI)

- VSWAP32 (SDI)

To understand what the sample does, first execute the program. You will see a
main application window with a splitter window (CSplitterWnd) in its client
area. A selection dialog will be displayed in the first pane and a view will be
displayed in the second pane.

Click on the View 1 and View 2 buttons. Notice that the view in the second pane
will switch from one to the other. The view is changing, but after looking at
the source you'll see that the document stays the same.
