SUMMARY
=======

Passing a Recordset object from a client to an OLE automation server (or vice
versa) is allowed. However, this Recordset object cannot subsequently be
assigned to a data control. Any attempt to do so results in error 419,
"Permission to use object denied."

CAUSE
=====

Notifications for the IConnectionPoint interface are not currently marshaled by
OLE, so setting the Recordset property of a data control to a Recordset object
that was passed in from another process fails at some point during
initialization. All properties and methods of the Recordset object can be
utilized normally, so code can be written to access the passed Recordset object
and perform all desired DAO operations.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to reproduce problem
--------------------------

1. Create a minimal OLE server and a client that accesses the OLE server.
  Step-by-step instructions that describe this type of functionality can be
  found in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q129801 How to Create and Use a Minimal OLE Automation Server

  The following steps assume a client and server created from Q129801 for
  clarity purposes. However, the following steps can be implemented in any
  client and server to see the behavior described in this article.

2. In the server project, add a form by clicking Form on the Insert menu. On
  this new form, place a single data control.

3. Add the following procedure to Class1 (assuming the form added in step 2 is
  named Form1):

        Public Sub SetRecordset(x As Recordset)
           Set Form1.Data1.Recordset = x
        End Sub

4. Press F5 or click Start on the Run menu to start the OLE server.

5. Load the client into another instance of Visual Basic.

6. Add a single data control to Form1 of the client. Set the properties of the
  data control to the following:

  DatabaseName = BIBLIO.MDB
  RecordSource = Authors

7. Change the Form_Click event to contain the following code:

        Private Sub Form_Click()
           Dim x As Object
           Set x = CreateObject("Project1.Class1")
           Data1.Refresh
           x.SetRecordset Data1.Recordset
           Set x = Nothing
        End Sub

8. Press F5 or click Start on the Run menu to start the client application.
  Click on the form to execute the code added in step 7. Error 419 is displayed
  on the Set statement in the OLE server (you may need to minimize the client
  to see this error).
