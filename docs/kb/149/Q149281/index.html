SUMMARY
=======

Macintosh allows files to be saved without extensions. When a Windows 95 client
examines the file with Explorer, the files will appear as the default document
icon with the Windows logo.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT provides a method to add extensions to file names in an orderly
fashion for any program that requires an extension. The method can be broken
down into the following steps:

1. On a Windows NT Server running Services for Macintosh "SFM" create a
  Macintosh volume for each of the extensions needed. For example, if your
  converting Excel, Word, and PowerPoint files, create new folders for each of
  these programs in the Windows NT Macintosh volume.

2. Copy all the files to their respective volume share on the Windows NT Server.

3. Go to a Windows NT command prompt, then go to the Microsoft Word directory
  and type:

  " ren *.* *.doc " (without the quotation marks)

4. Switch to the Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint directories and do the same,
  typing:

  " ren *.* *.xls
  ren *.* *.ppt
  " (without the quotation marks)

5. Examine the files using Windows 95 Explorer and you will see that the files
  now have the correct icon and can be easily opened with Explorer and the
  parent application.

There are three consideration to take into account with this process. The first
limitation is that Windows 95 is not Unicode aware. While Macintosh clients can
save files with file names such as 2/6/96, Windows 95 programs will be unable to
open or rename these files. To correct this problem, rename them from a
Macintosh client or from Windows NT server.


The second consideration is the current file name length. If by adding the ".doc"
extension, the Macintosh file name exceeds 31 characters, the file name will be
converted on the Macintosh side to an MS-DOS short name. However, you will still
be able to see all the characters from Office 95. Thus, if you had a Macintosh
file named: "Spooky Kitty lost his Katnip," it would get renamed to "Spooky
Kitty lost his Katnip.doc." And because this causes the file name to exceed 31
characters, SFM would display it to Macintosh users as "Spooky~1.DOC." This
display issue comes from a Macintosh limitation, which states that the file
names cannot be longer than 31 characters.

Finally, when the Macintosh file contains several periods in the name, The
process above will place the extension after the first period. For example, if
the Macintosh saved the file as "Spooky.Kitty.likes.Katnip," when the conversion
process is completed the file while be renamed "Spooky.Doc."
