The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When Microsoft Exchange Windows clients are used to add a public folder to the
public folder Favorites list, any subfolders of that public folder will not be
available through the Favorites list.

This is by design and has been implemented this way to reduce network traffic.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, consider the following public folder tree.

Public Folder A
  Public Folder B
     Public Folder C

If Public Folder A is added to the Favorites, upon selecting this folder through
the Favorites, its subfolders (Public Folder B and Public Folder C) will not be
seen.

The public folder tree could be physically on many different Microsoft Exchange
Servers, even though each user will only see one public folder tree. If the
Microsoft Exchange client displayed the folder hierarchy below each public
folder favorite and was notified of each addition to the public folder (in order
to display the folder name in boldface), each individual user could have network
connections to many different servers and receive notifications of new items
from all of them. As the number of users increased, the network traffic
generated by the public folder notifications would increase. For organizations
with tens of thousands of Microsoft Exchange users, this network traffic could
be significant.
