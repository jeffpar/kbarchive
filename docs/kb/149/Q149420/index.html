The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT 3.5 includes with an IDE CD-ROM (ATAPI 1.2) driver that should
support all compact discs, versions 4x and later, that Creative Labs currently
packages in its multimedia kits. This driver can be set up during or after NT
Setup. The setup and troubleshooting procedures are listed below.

This article addresses the following topics:

  -Setting Up IDE CD-ROM Support During NT Setup
  -Adding IDE CD-ROM Support to NT After NT Setup
  -Troubleshooting Creative Labs IDE CD-ROMs in NT

MORE INFORMATION
================

Setting Up IDE CD-ROM Support During NT Setup:
----------------------------------------------

During NT Setup, you will be asked if you want to perform a mass storage device
scan. If you press Enter at this time, NT should find the IDE CD-ROM driver
during its scan and continue.

Another option is to press S to skip the mass storage device scan, then press S
again to specify your own SCSI devices, and scroll up through the list to IDE
CD-ROM (ATAPI 1.2).

B. Adding IDE CD-ROM Support to NT After NT Setup:
--------------------------------------------------

1. In the Main Group, start the Windows NT Setup Program.

2. Under Options and click Add SCSI Adapters.

3. Select IDE CD-ROM (ATAPI 1.2) and click Install.

  NOTE: If Setup asks for disks at this point instead of prompting for the
  Current driver, quit Setup, copy the file Atapi.sys from Disk 3 of the
  Microsoft Windows NT Setup disk set to the %Systemroot%\System32\Drivers
  directory, and try this procedure again.

4. Close the Setup program and restart NT.

C. Troubleshooting Creative Labs IDE CD-ROMs in NT
--------------------------------------------------

Check to make sure that the IDE address, IRQ, and port match the table below:

IDE Port                              I/O Address     IRQ Lines
---------------------------------------------------------------
Primary                               1F0             14
Secondary                             170             15
Tertiary (not currently supported)    1E8             11, 12
Quaternary (not currently supported)  168             10, 11

Try all the settings above except for Primary, 1F0, 14, which is reserved for
boot device. Reinstall the driver and shut down and restart the system each time
a configuration change is made.

Check the Event Viewer in the Administrative Tools group to see if the driver
loaded properly.

Use the NT Diagnostics program in the Administrative Tools group to find hardware
conflicts.

If the CD-ROM drive is the only device on its cable, make sure that it is set to
Master. If the CD-ROM drive shares its cable with a hard drive, set the hard
drive to Master and the CD-ROM drive to Slave.

Disable the Sound Blaster IDE port via jumpers on the Sound Blaster card (refer
to the Creative Labs documentation for jumper settings) and try the CD- ROM
drive on the existing IDE port.
