SYMPTOMS
========

This article provides some guidelines for using DAO in regular DLLs. In general,
avoid performing any DAO construction, destruction, or operations inside the
DLL's InitInstance or ExitInstance functions. Otherwise, you might see the
following assertions:

  Assertion failed in DAOCORE.CPP, line 36

  (in Visual C++ 4.0)

  Assertion failed in APPCORE.CPP, line 585 (in Visual C++ 4.1)

  (in Visual C++ 4.1)

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. MFC/DAO objects need to be created after
CWinApp::InitInstance and destroyed before terminating DAO. By default, MFC
attempts to terminate DAO within CWinApp::ExitInstance.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The AfxDaoTerm helper function terminates the DAO database engine. In
applications, AfxDaoTerm is called automatically, but in DLLs, it must be
explicitly invoked before the DLL's ExitInstance function.

Here are some general guidelines to follow:

- Create any MFC/DAO objects after the DLL's InitInstance function. For
  additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q147629 PRB: Problems If ODBC or DAO in DLL's InitInstance or DLLMain

- Destroy these objects before calling AfxDaoTerm.

- Call AfxDaoTerm before calling the DLL's ExitInstance function.

Because the AfxDaoTerm helper function terminates the database engine, it must be
called after all MFC/DAO objects have been destroyed.

AfxDaoInit
----------

This function initializes the DAO database engine. In most cases, you don't need
to call AfxDaoInit because the application calls it when it is needed.
AfxDaoInit is called during the construction of the first MFC/DAO object.

AfxDaoTerm
----------

This function terminates the DAO database engine. Typically, this function only
needs to be called in a DLL; an application automatically calls AfxDaTerm when
it is needed.

When DAO is initialized, MFC will set the m_lpfnDaoTerm pointer in the CWinApp
class to point to AfxDaoTerm(). When CWinApp::ExitInstance is invoked, by
default it invokes the value of m_lpfnDaoTerm if it is set.

In a Regular DLL, you need to call AfxDaoTerm() before the default ExitInstance
is invoked because ExitInstance is invoked by DllMain. Visual C++ 4.0 had a
documented bug where the .exe's ExitInstance would shut down DAO, causing an
assertion when the Regular DLL's ExitInstance was called.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q143084 FIX: Problems with Using the MFC DAO Classes in a .DLL or .OCX

All MFC/DAO objects in the DLL must be destroyed before the call to AfxDaoTerm.
Be careful about the scope of local and global DAO objects. For example, the
following code causes an assert:

     SomeExportedFunc( .. )
     {
        // Only call for regular MFC DLL's
        #ifndef _AFXDLL
        AFX_MANAGE_STATE(AfxGetStaticModuleState());
        #endif

        CDaoDatabase db;
        db.Open(..);
        db.Close();
        AfxDaoTerm();
     }

Because the DAO object db is a local variable, it remains in scope until
SomeExportedFunc returns. The call to AfxDaoTerm causes an assertion because DAO
terminates while db still has scope. Similarly, a global DAO object has scope
throughout the life of the DLL, so a call to AfxDaoTerm also results in an
assertion.

To ensure that your MFC/DAO objects are destroyed before calling AfxDaoTerm,
avoid global objects and create local objects dynamically by using the new
operator as in this example:

     SomeExportedFunc( .. )
     {
        // Only call for regular MFC DLL's
        #ifndef _AFXDLL
        AFX_MANAGE_STATE(AfxGetStaticModuleState());
        #endif

        CDaoDatabase *DB = new CDaoDatabase;
        pDB-&gt;Open(..);

        // do something

        pDB-&gt;Close();

        // Destroy the object with delete
        delete pDB;

        // can now safely terminate DAO
        AfxDaoTerm();
     }

A variation is to export special creation and termination functions as in the
following example. The advantage of this method is that DAO is running and
connections remain open during the life of the DLL. The disadvantage is that the
user of the DLL is responsible for explicitly calling these special functions.

     SomeExportedInitializeDAO( .. )
     {
        // Only call for regular MFC DLL's
        #ifndef _AFXDLL
        AFX_MANAGE_STATE(AfxGetStaticModuleState());
        #endif

        m_pDB = new CDaoDatabase;
        m_pDB-&gt;Open(..);
     }

Then, to terminate MFC/DAO:

     SomeExportedDestroyObjectsAndTerminateDAO( .. )
     {
        // Only call for regular MFC DLL's
        #ifndef _AFXDLL
        AFX_MANAGE_STATE(AfxGetStaticModuleState());
        #endif

       m_pDB-&gt;Close();
       delete m_pDB;
       AfxDaoTerm();
     }
