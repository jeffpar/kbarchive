- Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Showing a modal form in the Form_Load event of a different form causes any SSTab
controls on the modal form to ignore all mouse and keyboard commands. This
problem occurs with both the 16-bit and 32-bit SSTab OCXs.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem occurs only when the tab control is on a form that is shown modally
during the load event of another form. To avoid this problem, either show the
form non-modally, or show the form modally, but in an event other than the
Form_Load event of the first form. Alternatively, one can emulate the appearance
of showing the second form modally using a scheme similar to the one outlined
below, although any code placed in the Form_Load event will be executed because
execution will not pause when the second form is shown. This should be taken
into account if code is written using this method. The following code fragment
makes the first form invisible and then shows the second form. When the second
form is unloaded, one line of code in the Unload event of the second form makes
the first form visible again.

  Sample Code
  ----------------

     ' On Form1
     Private Sub Form_Load()

        Form1.Visible = False
        Form2.Show

     End Sub

     ' On Form2
     Private Sub Form_Unload()

        Form1.Visible = True

     End Sub

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Basic 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start Visual Basic 4.0. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a second form to the project by selecting Form from the Insert menu.

3. Add a single SSTab to Form2. Leave all properties as default.

4. Add this code to the Form_Load event of Form1:

     Private Sub Form_Load()
        Form2.Show vbModal
     End Sub

5. Press F5 or select Start from the Run menu to start the application. Form2
  displays, but the tab control does not respond to any mouse or keyboard
  commands.
