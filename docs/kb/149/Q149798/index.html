SUMMARY
=======

This article lists the actor names and locations for each of the Talent Book
pages in 3D Movie Maker.

MORE INFORMATION
================

How to use the table:

The Talent Book Page column reflects the Talent Book page number for each actor.
The Actor column shows the actors name as it appears on the page, and the
Location column indicates where the actor's page can be found. In many cases, in
addition to listing the room in which the actor can be found, the listing also
shows where you must move once you are in the room to get to the appropriate
location.

For example, Alexander's entry in the lists appears as follows:

Talent
Book
Pg  Actor       Location
------------------------
1.  Alexander   Projects Room (back): Green bottle on the right.

To get to Alexander's page, go to the Projects Room. In the Projects Room, move
your mouse to the bottom of the screen and click when the pointer turns into an
arrow that points backward.
