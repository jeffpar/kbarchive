SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to upgrade to MSN, The Microsoft Network, version 1.2
without being connected to MSN.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The easiest way to upgrade to MSN 1.2 is to connect to MSN and allow it to
automatically upgrade your files. However, there may be circumstances in which
you prefer to manually upgrade to MSN 1.2. For example:

- You successfully upgraded to MSN 1.2, but you have since removed MSN or
  installed an earlier version of the MSN files.

- You successfully upgraded one computer to MSN 1.2 and you have several other
  computers you would like to upgrade without spending several minutes of
  connect time for each upgrade.

To upgrade to MSN 1.2 without connecting to MSN, use the following steps.

NOTE: You must have previously upgraded to MSN 1.2 for these steps to work.

1. Locate the Msn12.inf and Msn12.cab files. These files are normally located in
  the Program Files/The Microsoft Network folder.

2. Use the right mouse button to click the Msn12.inf file, and then click
  Install on the menu that appears.

To upgrade several computers, copy the files to each computer, or copy the files
to a network server that can be accessed from each computer.

For information about uninstalling MSN 1.2, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
