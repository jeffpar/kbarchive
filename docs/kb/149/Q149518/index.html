SYMPTOMS
========

There is a problem in the Video Poker Game sample included with Microsoft
Fortran PowerStation 4.0. If you change a value of one of the scoring hands
payoff values in the Poker Paytable dialog box and press the ENTER key while the
changed payoff value edit box has the focus, the OK button callback routine
isn't called. Consequently, the changed payoff values are not saved. This
problem also occurs if you press the OK button's shortcut keys (Alt+O).

The OK button's callback routine is called and the payoff values saved only when
the user clicks the OK button with the mouse or presses the TAB key to move to
the OK button and then presses the ENTER key.

CAUSE
=====

The IDD_POKERPAY dialog box has two different OK buttons, one directly on top of
the other, and both are selected as the default button. The dialog box manager
is picking the IDOK2 (not visible) OK button when you exit the dialog, but the
callback function is expecting the other button IDCHECKOK (visible) to be the
default.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the IDOK2 button from the IDD_POKERPAY dialog box. In Developer Studio,
with the Video Poker Game project open in the active workspace select the
Poker.rc file from the file viewer and open the IDD_POKERPAY dialog. Once the
dialog is open, highlight and drag the visible OK button to one side
(IDCHECKOK). This should reveal a second OK button hiding directly underneath
the first one (IDOK2). This is the button that must be removed from the dialog.
Select it, and delete it. After deleting the IDOK2 button, move the correct
button (IDCHECKOK) back to its original location, and rebuild the Video Poker
Game project.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Copy the "POKER: Video Poker Game" sample files from FPS 4.0 Books Online in
  the Samples/General section to your computer's hard disk.

2. Run the Poker.exe program and open the Poker Paytable dialog box by selecting
  the Edit Paytable option from the Game menu.

3. Change the Royal Flush edit box value to 200, and press the ENTER key, or
  press the OK button's shortcut keys (Alt+O).

4. From the Game menu, select the Edit Paytable option again. Note the value
  entered in the Royal Flush edit box in Step 3 was not saved.
