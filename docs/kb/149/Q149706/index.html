- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, on platform(s):
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT

SYMPTOMS
========

The MicroGate SDLC Link Service may report an IRQ conflict if the MicroGate MG96
or MG144 SDLC adapter is installed in a SNA Server. When you select Adapter
Details during the MicroGate link service installation, you will see information
similar to the following if this problem occurs:

  I/O Port Address: 0x380
  Interrupt(IRQ): conflict?
  DMA Channel: 1

The System Event Log may also contain the following errors:

  

  Event ID: 7001
  Source: Service Control Manager
  Description: The SnaMG1 service depends on the IBMSYNC service which
  failed to start because of the following error: A device attached to
  the system is not functioning.

  Event ID: 7000
  Source: Service Control Manager
  Description: The IBMSYNC service failed to start due to the following
  error:
  A device attached to the system is not functioning.

CAUSE
=====

The MicroGate MG96 and MG144 SDLC adapters include a built-in V.32 modem. These
adapters are hardwired to use IRQs 3 and 4. Microsoft Windows NT detects IRQ3 as
being used by the UART on these adapters during its startup sequence.

WORKAROUND
==========

Change the dip switches on the MicroGate SDLC adapter to have the UART use COM3,
instead of COM2, which is the default. The changes must be made via dip switches
on the adapter because they are not software configurable. The diagnostics
software will allow you to make configuration changes and test the changes.
However, the changes are written to a configuration file and do not change the
adapter settings.

The default dip switch settings on the adapter are:

S1: 1-8:  01111001 (0=off, 1=on) S2: 1-4: 1111 (all flipped up to ON
position)

Change the dip switches to:

S1: 1-8:  10011001               S2: 1-4: 0111

This instructs the adapter to use COM3 for the UART.

UART = COM3, Base Address = x'03e8', IRQ = 5
