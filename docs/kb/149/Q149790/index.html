SUMMARY
=======

This article provides tips and tricks to getting around in GhostWriter, and
hints on how to obtain clues.

MORE INFORMATION
================

GhostWriter is a group of documents used in conjunction with Creative Writer
that directs the participant to solve "clues" in a mystery. There are nine cases
to solve in the first nine documents, and the clues you get help you solve the
case. The last file of the case is encrypted, so you'll use the nine letters you
received as clues to decrypt the final document. The clues allow you to solve
the final portion of the case.

Where Is the Documentation? How Do I Get Started?
-------------------------------------------------

To set up, follow the instructions printed on the disk label. This installs
several files on your computer.

You can start the mystery in two ways. You can either click the Begin Blue Makva
icon in the MS Kids folder, or, if you are in Creative Writer, you can choose
the Author GhostWriter and the documents are displayed. Start with Introduction,
which explains you how to get around, what to open, and how to set up a case
notebook.

Printing directly from a Blue Makva document may be slow. This is because the
documents are heavily formatted. Also, the case notebook cannot be printed
directly. However, you can create a new document in Creative Writer and copy
everything from the casebook to your new document and print it.
