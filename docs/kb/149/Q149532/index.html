  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

An Event ID 2009 "Number of sessions exceeds 2048" may be recorded in the event
log and/or clients may be unable to create new connections to the server.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because computers that run Microsoft Windows NT clients
and use excessive numbers of ports (more than 3,976 simultaneously) may run out
of ports before TCP/IP releases closed connections. The TCP/IP-state computer
dictates that when a connection is closed, the connection is not released until
two maximum segment lives (MSLs) have passed. This state is defined as the
Time-wait state. Since one MSL is defined as 120 seconds, it takes four minutes
for a closed connection to be released in TCP/IP.

NOTE: For more information on MSL and Time-wait, please refer to Internet RFC
793.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this behavior, you must make the following registry change:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrectControlSet\services\Tcpip\Parameters

The registry value is:

TcpTimedWaitDelay

Key: Tcpip\Parameters
Value Type: REG_DWORD - Time in seconds
Valid Range: 30-300 (decimal)
Default: 0xF0 (240 decimal)


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT Workstation
version 3.51 and Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51. This problem was
corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT Workstation or Server
version 3.51. For information on obtaining this update, query "servpack"
(without the quotation marks) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

This registry entry was first added in Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack 5. Customers
using Windows NT 3.51 need to apply Service Pack 5 before making this
modification.
