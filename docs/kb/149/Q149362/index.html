SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT local groups cannot be used for purposes of permission assignment to
Microsoft Exchange Server site objects unless all Microsoft Exchange Server
computers, the local group, the user account to be added to the local group, and
the machine account that the Administrator program is run on were all created
within the same domain as the Exchange Server computers that you are trying to
administer. Note that adding a two-way trust between multiple domains cannot be
used as a workaround. All accounts involved have to be in the same domain before
you will be able to use local groups to administer any Exchange Server objects.

If any of the above mentioned accounts are not in the same domain as the Exchange
Server computer you are trying to administer, you may receive the following
error:

  "You do not have the permissions required to complete the operation:
  "Microsoft Exchange Directory ID no: DS_E_INSUFFICIENT_ACCESS_RIGHTS"

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Exchange Server 4.0, the user and machine accounts did not have to be in the
same domain. They could be located in a second domain, and the user account
could just be added to the local group in the Exchange Server computer's domain.
However, this had the potential of exposing problems when the data is written to
the remote Directory Service. With Exchange Server 5.0 and 5.5 the architecture
has been changed to require that all accounts involved have to be in the same
domain as the Exchange Server computer. Local groups that do not have all the
accounts in the Exchange Server computer's domain will not be supported in
Exchange Server versions 5.0 and 5.5.
