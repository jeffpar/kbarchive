SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to change the personal information store (.pst file)
that is associated with a set of personal folders in Microsoft Exchange, or move
the personal information store to a different location.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To change the .pst file that is associated with a set of personal folders in
Microsoft Exchange, follow these steps:

1. Quit Microsoft Exchange if it is running.

2. Use Microsoft Explorer to rename the .pst file that is associated with the
  set of personal folders, or move the .pst file to a different location. To
  determine the file name and location of the .pst file, double-click the Mail
  And Fax icon in Control Panel, click the set of personal folders in the list
  of information services, and then click Properties.

3. Start Microsoft Exchange. The following message is displayed

  The file &lt;path&gt;\&lt;filename&gt;.pst was not found

  where &lt;path&gt; is the location of the original .pst file and
  &lt;filename&gt; is the file name of the original .pst file.

4. Click OK.

5. The Create/Open Personal Folders File dialog box is displayed, prompting you
  to create a new .pst file or specify the location of an existing .pst file.
  If you want to create a new .pst file, type the path and file name for the
  new .pst file in the File Name box, and then click Open. If you want to use
  an existing .pst file, type the path and file name of the existing .pst file
  in the File Name box, and then click Open.

  If you are creating a new .pst file, the Create Microsoft Personal Folders
  dialog box is displayed after you click Open. Click OK to close the dialog
  box and create the new .pst file.

To move the .pst file that is associated with a set of personal folders in
Microsoft Exchange to a different location, follow these steps:

1. Quit Microsoft Exchange if it is running.

2. Use Microsoft Explorer to move the .pst file to the new location. To
  determine the file name and location of the .pst file, double-click the Mail
  And Fax icon in Control Panel, click the set of personal folders in the list
  of information services, and then click Properties.

3. Start Microsoft Exchange. The following message is displayed

  The file &lt;path&gt;\&lt;filename&gt;.pst was not found

  where &lt;path&gt; is the location of the original .pst file and
  &lt;filename&gt; is the file name of the original .pst file.

4. Click OK.

5. The Create/Open Personal Folders File dialog box is displayed, prompting you
  to create a new .pst file or specify the location of an existing .pst file.
  Type the new path and file name for the .pst file in the File Name box, and
  then click Open.

If you double-click the Mail And Fax icon in Control Panel, click the set of
personal folders in the list of information services, and then click Properties,
you can view the path and file name information for the .pst file, but you
cannot modify this information. To modify the location or file name of a .pst
file, you must use the procedure described in this article.
