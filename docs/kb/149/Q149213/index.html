-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Schedule+ 7.0 accounts can be created as Resource Accounts, for example
Conference Rooms, Overhead Projectors, Company Vehicles, etc. These Resources
can also be configured to automatically accept meeting requests and clear
canceled meetings from their appointment book.

NOTE: Auto-booking of appointments does not work when you send meeting requests
between Microsoft Mail for PC Networks postoffices and Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0 environments. Mail for PC Networks does not support Bcc:
recipients.


MORE INFORMATION
================

By placing the Resource account into the RESOURCE address box of the Meeting
Attendees dialog box, it will place the ResourceID in the Bcc: line of the
meeting request message. The ResourceID will also be displayed in the Where:
field of the meeting request message. Schedule+ will only search for users
listed in the Bcc: box to perform the auto-booking of appointments. This
eliminates overhead of parsing addresses, locating the appointment book,
determining the Account-type (Resource or not) and accessing permissions to all
users; therefore, it improves performance.

NOTE: Entering ResourceIDs into any address box other than that of a Resource
Attendee (for example, Required or Optional) will disable the Auto-booking
features.

Inviting the Resource to Attend a Meeting

Attendee (for example, Required or Optional) will disable the Auto-booking
features.
