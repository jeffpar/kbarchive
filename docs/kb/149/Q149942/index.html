SUMMARY
=======

To fully automate the process of logging on to a SLIP server using a Windows NT
Remote Access Service (RAS) client, you must use Rasdial.exe to dial the SLIP
server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows NT RAS PhoneBook application (Rasphone.exe) does not include a
facility to fully automate logging on to a SLIP server. You can use the
Switch.inf file to automate all parts of the logon process except the receipt of
the IP address. In the Terminal window, RAS prompts you to manually supply the
IP address; there is a field for it in the lower right corner.

To fully automate the connection to the SLIP server, you can use the Rasdial
command-line utility as follows:

1. Use the RAS PhoneBook application to create an entry for your SLIP server.
  Note the entry name you assign to this new entry.

2. Click Network and make sure SLIP is selected.

3. Click Security. In the After Dialing field, select the name of the Switch.inf
  script you created to automate the process of logging on to your SLIP
  server.

  For additional information on automating a RAS logon using the Switch.inf
  file, refer to the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q125975Automating Remote RAS Logons Using SWITCH.INF Scripts

4. Connect to the SLIP server using the RAS PhoneBook entry you have just
  created. You must enter the IP address in the Terminal window; however, you
  will not need to do this again. RAS records the address you enter in the
  Rasphone.pbk file, under the SlipIpAddress parameter.

5. For future connections to the SLIP server, run the following command:

  Rasdial &lt;entry name&gt;

  where &lt;entry name&gt; is the entry name you assigned in step 1.

  Rasdial does not prompt you to enter the IP address in the Terminal window.
  Rasdial uses the IP address included in the section of Rasphone.pbk for your
  SLIP entry.

NOTE: This procedure only works if you are assigned the same IP address by the
SLIP server each time you dial in. If the SLIP server does not assign you the
same IP address each time, you must use the RAS PhoneBook application, which
enables you to enter whatever IP address the SLIP server assigns you.
