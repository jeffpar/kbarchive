-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- MSN versions 5.0, 5.1, 5.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect to MSN, The Microsoft Network, you may receive any
of the following error messages:

  Invalid Member ID or Password.

  Could not connect. The Member ID or Password is not valid.

  The password is not valid. Please type it again.

  The Member ID is not valid. Please make sure it is correct and try again.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur for any for the following reasons:

- You may have typed your MSN Member ID or password incorrectly.

- Dial-Up Networking uses your password file, &lt;Username&gt;.pwl, for
  password validation. This file may be damaged.

- The MSN connections in Dial-Up Networking may be damaged.

- Dial-Up Networking may be damaged.

- Your account may not be available because it is locked or it has expired.

- MSN is temporarily unable to validate your account.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, first retype your correct MSN Member ID and password in
the MSN sign-in screen.

NOTE: Your MSN Member ID does not include @msn.com. That is only used as part of
your MSN e-mail address.

If you continue to receive the error message, use the methods below in the order
presented. After you complete each method, attempt to connect to MSN. If you are
unable to connect to MSN, continue with the next method.

Rename Password List Files
--------------------------

To eliminate password file problems, locate and then rename your password list
file. The file is named &lt;Username&gt;.pwl, where as &lt;Username&gt; is the
name you use to log on to MSN, and should be located in the Windows folder. To
rename the file, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click "Files or Folders".

2. In the Named box, type *.pwl, and then click Find Now.

3. Right-click your &lt;Username.pwl&gt; file, click Rename, and then type a new
  name for the file, such as &lt;Username.old&gt;.

  NOTE: If you are using a personal certificate, you should export it before
  renaming your .pwl file. If you do not do so, it may be unavailable when you
  send e-mail. For more information, see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q190296 Unable to Use Personal Certificatesin Outlook Express

4. Double-click the MSN icon to open the sign-in screen.

5. Click the Remember My Password check box to clear it.

6. Type xxxxxxxx in the Member ID and Password boxes, and then click Connect. Do
  not use your existing password.

7. When you receive the Invalid member ID or password error message, click OK.

8. Type your correct member ID and password in the Member ID and Password boxes,
  and then click Connect.

NOTE: If you have installed Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1, password list
files may be damaged even after you delete them and they are recreated
automatically. To resolve this issue, obtain the Mspwlupd.exe update file and
run it. You can obtain this update file from your MSN CD or from the following
page on the Microsoft site on the World Wide Web:

  http://www.microsoft.com/windows95
