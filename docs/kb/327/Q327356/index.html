SUMMARY
=======

When you configure 3270 print sessions and 5250 print sessions to use a Printer
Definition Table (PDT) file, you may receive Event 25 error messages similar to
the following in the Application Event Log for each print job that the print
session processes:

  Event ID: 25
  Source: SNA Virtual Print Driver
  Description: If your print output is correct, this warning can be ignored.

  If your session has "Printer Language is Hewlett-Packard (HP) PCL" selected,
  then the SNA Virtual Print Driver has not recognised your PaperSize (1) or
  Orientation (1) setting. If your job output has incorrect PaperSize or
  Orientation, use GDI printing or put the definitions in the START_JOB macro
  in your PDT file.

  If your session is not configured for HP PCL, the SNA Virtual Print Driver
  cannot automatically apply PaperSize and Orientation Admin settings. If your
  job output has incorrect PaperSize or Orientation, use GDI printing or put
  the definitions in the START_JOB macro in your PDT file.

  Print Session: &lt;Print Session Name&gt;.
  Printer: &lt;Printer Name&gt;.

This behavior can cause the Application Event Log to fill up on computers that
print a large number of print jobs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A supported feature that modifies the product's default behavior is now
available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to modify the behavior that is
described in this article. Apply it only to systems that specifically need it.
This feature may receive additional testing. Therefore, if your system is not
severely affected by the lack of this feature, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 service pack that
contains this feature.

To obtain this feature immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services.
For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information on support costs, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

The English version of this fix has the file attributes (or later) that are
listed in the following table. The dates and times for these files are listed in
coordinated universal time (UTC). When you view the file information, it is
converted to local time. To find the difference between UTC and local time, use
the Time Zone tab in the Date and Time tool in Control Panel.

  Date          Time    Version     Size      File name

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.




The print service that is included with Host Integration Server 2000 was designed
to log an Event 25 error message for each print job when the print service
cannot recognize the paper size, orientation, or paper source that you specified
in the printer's DEVMODE structure.

Because most print jobs print correctly even when Event 25 error messages are
logged, it was determined that a reduction in the frequency of Event 25 error
messages would help to prevent unnecessary message logging.

After you apply the update, the print server logs an Event 25 error message only
when the print session is initially activated. The event is not logged for each
print job that is processed by the print session.
