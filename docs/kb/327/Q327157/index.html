SYMPTOMS
========

While you are configuring a 3270 emulator, such as the Microsoft SNA Server 3270
emulator or Attachmate's Extra Personal Client, an access violation may occur in
the SNADMOD SNAGetUserRecord() function.

A second symptom, if an access violation does not occur, is that the list of 3270
logical units (LUs) that is shown in the configuration may have incorrect data
at the end of the list, and the list may be incomplete or inaccurate.

If Drwtsn32.exe is configured as the default debugger, and if you are using the
3270 Client that is included with SNA Server or Host Integration Server 2000, a
Drwtsn32.log similar to the following is generated:

Application exception occurred:
       App: obj\i386\win3270.exe (pid=976)
       When: 7/24/2002 @ 13:36:28.086
       Exception number: c0000005 (access violation)

CAUSE
=====

This is an SNA Server-side issue, not an emulator issue. This problem occurs
only when the following two conditions exist:

- The User Workstation Secured option is selected for the 3270 LUs.

- 3270 LUs are assigned to both a User/Group record and a Workstation record.

Under these conditions, the SnaBase service on the SNA Server or Host Integration
Server 2000 system returns a user record that incorrectly indicates that the
user has access to more 3270 LUs than the user actually has access to. The
result is that the SNA Server or Host Integration Server 2000 Client may read
beyond the memory buffer that was allocated to store the returned user record.
This results in a list of 3270 LUs that contains invalid characters (as
mentioned in the "Symptoms" section).
