SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 cannot be run on a Novell
nondedicated server. A nondedicated server is a computer that operates as both a
server and a workstation at the same time.

The following are two possible workarounds:

- Run Windows 3.1 on all workstations, and run Windows 3.0 in real mode on the
  nondedicated server.

- Purchase another computer to be a dedicated server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Novell NetWare allows a server machine to double as a workstation. In this case,
the server is called a nondedicated file server. However, no extended or
expanded memory is available to the workstation, and Windows 3.0 can run in real
mode only. Windows 3.1 does not have a real mode and therefore cannot be run on
a nondedicated file server. For more information, query on the following words
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  win31 real stable

Nondedicated servers are available with the following Novell products:

  ELS Level I           (4 users)
  ELS Level II          (8 users)
  Advanced NetWare 286  (100 users)

A dedicated file server functions as a file server only. A dedicated file server
is preferable because the processor time is not split between the workstation
functions and the requirements of the file server.
