- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11

SUMMARY
=======

Every time a Windows-based application is opened after being closed, its display
window will appear slightly lower and to the right of the screen.

This will occur even if there are no other applications running.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is known as the "cascading" effect. This behavior is by design to prevent
most applications from hiding previous Windows. In most programs, the
application window will show in such a way that part of the required display
will not show completely. Solitaire, for example, will not display some of the
cards. If the application is then closed and reopened multiple times, it will
eventually show in such a position where its display will be optimal.

In Windows 3.1 the cascading effect can still be observed in the following
applications: Paintbrush, Write, Notepad, Terminal, Cardfile, Calendar,
Clipboard, Sound Recorder, and Object Packager.

This behavior is only characteristic of some Windows applications. In Windows
3.0, only the File Manager and the PIF Editor will not cascade (File Manager
will not allow more than one instance at the same time).

Other Windows-based applications such as Word and Excel will also behave in the
same manner. The only way to reset the original position for all applications is
to exit Windows and start it again.
