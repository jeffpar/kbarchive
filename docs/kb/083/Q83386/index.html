-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The information in this article was taken from the SYSINI.WRI file contained in
the Microsoft Windows Resource Kit for Windows version 3.1. The SYSINI.WRI file
may be viewed with Windows Write.

MORE INFORMATION
================

&lt;BR/&gt;
The [boot] section of the SYSTEM.INI file contains a list of drivers and
Windows modules that are used to configure Windows each time it boots. All
settings contained in this section are required, with the exception of the
CachedFileHandles entry.

If any of these settings are modified or deleted, Windows may not work
properly. There are no built-in default values for these settings; these
settings are assigned upon Setup based on the system configuration.

The [boot] section can contain the settings described in the following
paragraphs.

286grabber=&lt;filename&gt;
---------------------

Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies the filename of the device driver
         (called a grabber) that makes a non-Windows
         application visible when you use Windows in
         standard mode.
To change:  Choose the Windows Setup icon from the Main
           Group window. This setting changes when you
           change the Display setting in Setup. If you are
           installing a device driver that is not included
           with Windows, run Setup from MS-DOS.

386grabber=&lt;filename&gt;
---------------------

Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies the filename of the device driver
         (called a grabber) that makes a non-Windows
         application visible when you use Windows in 386
         enhanced mode.
To change:  Choose the Windows Setup icon from the Main
           Group window. This setting changes when you
           change the display setting in Setup. If you are
           installing a device driver that is not included
           with Windows, run Setup from MS-DOS.

CachedFileHandles=&lt;number&gt;
--------------------------

Default:  12
Purpose:  Specifies the number of the most recently-used
         executable (.exe) and dynamic link library (.dll)
         files that can remain open. Windows keeps these
         files open so that they can be accessed quickly,
         ensuring optimal performance. However, some
         networks have a limit on the number of files that
         can be open on a server at a time. If you are
         having problems running Windows from a Network
         server, use a lower number for this setting. Valid
         numbers are 2 through 12.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

comm.drv=&lt;filename&gt;
-------------------

Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies the filename of the serial
         communications driver you are using.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

display.drv=&lt;filename&gt;
----------------------

Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies the filename of the display driver you
         are using.
To change:  Choose the Windows Setup icon from the Main
           Group window. If you are installing a device
           driver that is not included with Windows, run
           Setup from MS-DOS.

drivers=&lt;filename-or-aliasname&gt;
-------------------------------

Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies the filename(s) or alias name(s) of the
         installable drivers that load when Windows is
         started. An installable driver is a dynamic-link
         library that is treated by Windows like a device
         driver. If the drivers you want to use include
         parameters, you must specify them by alias name.
         Alias names are defined in the [Drivers] section
         of the SYSTEM.INI file. You can list several file
         or alias names in this setting
To change:  Most setup programs add these settings to the
           SYSTEM.INI file when installing installable
           drivers, so you shouldn't need to change the
           settings. Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI
           file.

fixedfon.fon=&lt;filename&gt;
-----------------------

Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies the filename of the fixed system font
         used by Windows version 2.x. This font will still
         be used by version 2.x applications.
To change:  Choose the Windows Setup icon from the Main-
           group window. This setting changes when you
           change the display setting.

fonts.fon=&lt;filename&gt;
--------------------

Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies the filename of the proportionately-
         spaced system font used by Windows 3.1.
To change:  Choose the Windows Setup icon from the Main-
           group window. This setting changes when you
           change the display setting in Setup.

keyboard.drv=&lt;filename&gt;
-----------------------

Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies the filename of the keyboard driver you
         are using.
To change:  Choose the Windows Setup icon from the Main-
           group window and change the setting for the
           Keyboard option.

language.dll=&lt;library-name&gt;
---------------------------

Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies the name of the dynamic-link library
         that supplies language-specific functions. If no
         language library is specified, Windows uses the
         built-in U.S. English library.
To change:  Choose the International icon from the Control
           Panel window and change the setting for the
           Language option.

mouse.drv=&lt;filename&gt;
--------------------

Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies the filename of the mouse driver you are
         using.
To change:  Choose the Windows Setup icon from the Main-
           group window and change the setting for the
           Mouse option.

network.drv=&lt;filename&gt;
----------------------

Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies the filename of the network driver you
         are using.
To change:  Choose the Windows Setup icon from the Main-
           group window and change the setting for the
           Network option.

oemfonts.fon=&lt;filename&gt;
-----------------------

Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies the name of the font file for the OEM
         character set. This setting is associated with the
         display setting.
To change:  Quit Windows and then run Setup from MS-DOS.
           This setting changes when you change the
           Codepage or Display setting in Setup.

shell=&lt;filename&gt;
----------------

Default:  None (Setup initializes this value as PROGMAN.EXE)
Purpose:  Specifies the Windows program that runs when you
         start Windows. Unless you change this setting,
         Program Manager will run when you start Windows.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

sound.drv=&lt;filename&gt;
--------------------

Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies the filename of the system sound driver
         you are using.
To change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.

system.drv=&lt;filename&gt;
---------------------

Default:  None
Purpose:  Specifies the filename of the system hardware
         driver you are using.
To change:  Quit Windows and run Setup from MS-DOS.

TaskMan.Exe=&lt;filename&gt;
----------------------

Default:  taskman.exe
Purpose:  Specifies the task-switching application that
         appears when you press CTRL+ESC. If this setting
         does not appear in the SYSTEM.INI file, then
         Windows Task Manager is used as the task-switching
         application.
To Change:  Use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
