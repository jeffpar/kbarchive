SUMMARY
=======

If an application window or dialog box has a number of edit controls, the user
can lose track of the control that has the input focus. FlshEdit.exe is a sample
in the Microsoft Download Center that demonstrates how to make an edit control
flash to indicate that the control has the input focus. The technique used by
FLSHEDIT is similar to calling the FlashWindow function. FlashWindow flashes the
caption bar on a window to gain the user's attention.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  FlshEdit.exe

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

The FLSHEDIT sample contains a dialog box with four edit controls. The
application uses one timer, which is used to flash whichever edit control has
the focus. The application sets the timer each time an edit control receives the
input focus (an EN_SETFOCUS message). The timer is destroyed when an edit
control loses the input focus (an EN_KILLFOCUS message) or when the context of
the edit control changes (an EN_CHANGE message).

When the specified time elapses and the application receives a WM_TIMER message,
the application invalidates the contents of the edit control and specifies the
new text and background colors. Then Windows redraws the control using the new
colors.

Therefore, a control stops flashing when either of the following events take
place:

- The user takes the input focus away from the control.

- The user changes the text contents of the control.

The FLSHEDIT application provides an option to stop the flashing and to change
the color of the flashing.

In addition to flashing, the FLSHEDIT sample changes the text in an edit control
to indicate that the control has the input focus. However, if the user changes
the contents of an edit control, the changed text remains even after the user
moves the input focus to another control. If the user changes the text to an
empty string, the edit control regains its default contents.

Windows 3.0 does not properly change the background color of a single-line edit
control.


FLSHEDIT incorporates the first method provided by this Knowledge Base article.
