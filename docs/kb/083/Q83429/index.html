SUMMARY
=======

If you use the Logitech Mouse with the Microsoft Windows operating system
version 3.1, you may experience problems using the mouse in an MS-DOS window if
you start the MS-DOS application with a program information file (PIF).

MORE INFORMATION
================

With Windows 3.1, you can use the mouse in an MS-DOS application that is being
run in a window if you have an MS-DOS-based mouse driver and a Windows mouse
driver that support this functionality. The MS-DOS-based mouse driver must be
able to communicate with Windows mouse driver for this to work correctly. The
Microsoft mouse driver version 8.2 or later and the Logitech mouse driver
version 6.02 or later support this feature.

If you are using the Logitech MS-DOS mouse driver and you start an MS-DOS
application in a window using a PIF, the mouse does not work. You must start the
application full screen and then move it into a window by pressing ALT+ENTER.


Logitech is aware of this problem and is working on an update to their mouse
driver.

Note: Running an MS-DOS application in a window is a feature of 386 enhanced mode
only.

The Logitech Mouse is manufactured by Logitech, Inc., vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
