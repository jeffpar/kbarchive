The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following Novell NetWare 286 rights are required to run the Microsoft
Windows SETUP /N command from a shared server directory to a network user
directory:

  In the shared directory, the user running SETUP /N must have Search (S), Open
  (O), and Read (R) rights.

  In the user directory, the user running SETUP /N must have Create (C), Delete
  (D), Read (R), Write (W), Open (O), Modify (M), and Search (S) rights. (That
  is, the user must have all rights except Parental [P].) NetWare 386 uses
  slightly different privilege naming, but this can be used as a guideline.

This information applies to Microsoft Windows versions 3.0 and 3.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is a discussion of the symptoms of not having the various rights
(privileges) to the directories when running SETUP /N.

Shared Directory        SETUP /N Returns
----------------        ----------------

No Search right (S)     Bad command or filename
No Open right   (O)     Bad command or filename
No Read right   (R)     Access denied

User Directory          SETUP /N Returns
--------------          ----------------

No Create right (C)     *
No Delete right (D)     *
No Read right   (R)     **
No Write right  (W)     **
No Open right   (O)     **
No Modify right (M)     **
No Search right (S)     Returns to MS-DOS command prompt with no
                       message

* File Copy Error. Unknown File Copy Failure: X:win.src

** Setup is having trouble making changes to
   your SYSTEM.INI file.

In order to make changes to your Windows configuration, you must delete
WINVER.EXE from your Windows directory and then run Setup again to reinstall
Windows.

Using the SETUP /N or SETUP command on a local hard drive has been reported to
also fail in systems with some ARCNET boards configured for IRQ2. In test
configurations, changing the interrupt from IRQ2 to IRQ3 corrected the problems.
Novell also confirmed that changing the interrupt on certain cards corrects
several problems with different (usually older) ARCNET boards. In the test,
there was nothing to indicate that there should have been any sort of interrupt
conflict.

The following error message may occur when running SETUP /N on systems with some
ARCNET cards:

  File copy error: Unknown File Copy Failure

To correct this, use SETUP /I /N. Be sure to use the switches in this order,
otherwise the /I switch will be ignored. Also confirm the following are true:

1. The Novell Shell version 3.01 is being used.

2. All the Windows 3.0 or 3.0a files have been expanded to the network.

3. All rights for the target directory (except for Parental) are present.

4. All expanded .SY$ files have been renamed.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.
