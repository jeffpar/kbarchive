SUMMARY
=======

Applications in the Windows environment must typically deal with two different
character sets: the ANSI (American National Standards Institute) character set
and the OEM (original equipment manufacturer) character set. Conversely,
applications in the MS-DOS environment must deal only with the OEM character
set. This article describes how Windows deals with the ANSI and OEM character
sets.

- When ALT+xxx is used to enter a character from the OEM character set into an
  application in the Windows environment that uses the ANSI character set,
  Windows displays the character in the ANSI character set that most closely
  matches the entered character.

- When a character from the OEM character set is entered into a file using a
  text editor under MS-DOS and the file is displayed under Windows, the
  character from the ANSI character set that has the same character code number
  as the OEM character is displayed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

OEM and ANSI Character Sets
---------------------------

MS-DOS uses the OEM character set. This character set varies between computers
and depends on the code page ROM (read-only memory) installed by the computer
manufacturer. For example, personal computers manufactured for use in the United
States use a character set called code page 437, while computers manufactured
for use in Portugal use code page 860. MS-DOS uses the OEM character set in
applications and to create files and filenames.

For the most part, Windows uses fonts organized according to the ANSI character
set (called ANSI-set fonts, in this article). Windows also supports fonts that
use the same OEM character set that MS-DOS uses (called OEM-set fonts, in this
article).

Character positions 32 through 127 are identical in the ANSI and OEM character
sets for most code pages (including code pages 437, 850, 852, 860, 861, and
865). The remaining characters of the OEM character set (character positions 0
through 31 and 128 through 255) either do not appear in the ANSI character set,
or exist at a different position in the ANSI character set. Therefore, some
characters in the OEM character set cannot be displayed in Windows using an
ANSI-set font. If an application must display such characters under Windows, an
OEM- set font is required.

Typing ANSI and OEM Characters in Windows
-----------------------------------------

In the Windows environment, a user can enter any character in the character set
by holding down the ALT key and typing 0xxx, where "xxx" is the decimal number
of the desired character position in the font. For example, with an ANSI-set
font in use, ALT+0123 will display the 123rd character in the ANSI character
set. Similarly, with an OEM-set font in use, ALT+0123 will display the 123rd
character in the OEM character set.

In the MS-DOS environment, a user can enter any character in the OEM character
set by holding down the ALT key and typing xxx (no leading zero), where "xxx" is
the decimal number of the desired character position in the font.

If a user enters an MS-DOS OEM character set code (ALT+xxx) in an application for
Windows that uses an ANSI-set font, Windows converts the OEM-set character to
the character that most closely matches in the ANSI set. This conversion is
governed by a mapping table that is installed with Windows. Because some OEM-set
characters with positions greater than 127 do not exist in the ANSI character
set, the result of the conversion in Windows may differ from the character in
the OEM set. The OemToAnsi function uses the same mapping table to perform its
character conversions.

For example, while OEM character-set code page 437 contains a square- root symbol
at position 251, the ANSI character set does not contain this character.
Consequently, when the user types an ALT+251 in an edit control that uses the
ANSI character set, an underscore character appears because Windows defines the
character mapping in this manner. As another example, the C-cedilla character
exists in both the ANSI character set and in the OEM character-set code page
437. Therefore, typing ALT+128 in an edit control creates the desired C-cedilla
character. Note that while the character exists in both character sets, its
position is different in each set (128 in the OEM character set and 199 in
ANSI). The alternative method to request a C-cedilla is to type ALT+0199, which
specifies the character's position in the ANSI character set.

An edit control that uses the ES_OEMCONVERT style and a combo box that uses the
CBS_OEMCONVERT style have a different behavior from that described above. These
two styles cause their text contents to be converted from lowercase letters to
uppercase letters, then from the ANSI set to the OEM set and then back to the
ANSI set for display. This behavior is important for an edit control in which
the user specifies a filename. If the user enters characters that do not exist
in the underlying OEM character set, the name of the file will differ from the
name specified by the user, which would be confusing. Because the characters are
mapped into characters that exist in the OEM character set, the filename
specified always matches the filename actually used. The contents are converted
to uppercase characters because it is customary in some languages to eliminate
diacritical marks when a character is in uppercase, and the OEM character set
does not contain uppercase characters with these diacritical marks.

Displaying a String Containing OEM-Set Characters

in an Application that Uses the ANSI Character Set
--------------------------------------------------

Text editors running under MS-DOS use the OEM character set for display and in
the files they create. When a Windows-based text editor loads a file that uses
the OEM character set, the editor interprets the characters according to the
ANSI character set. Character positions 32 through 127 are not affected under
most code pages because both the ANSI and OEM character sets have identical
characters. However, character positions greater than 127 may be displayed
differently than in the MS-DOS-based text editor because the character positions
represent different characters in the ANSI character set.

The solution to this difficulty is to use a Windows-based text editor that uses
the ANSI character set when the text contains characters in both the OEM and
ANSI character sets. A Windows-based editor accepts ANSI-set characters directly
and converts OEM-set characters to the closest matching ANSI-set characters. The
resulting text contains only ANSI-set characters, which can be displayed by any
application running under the Windows environment. If an application must
display OEM-set characters that are not in the ANSI character set, it must use
an OEM- set font.

Consider the following example: An MS-DOS-based text editor is used to edit a
application's resource file on a system with OEM character-set code page 437
installed. The user types ALT+129 as part of the static text to label a button
in a dialog box. However, when the dialog box is displayed, the text is not as
expected but contains a black rectangle where the u-umlaut character belongs.
The black rectangle is used to signify character positions that are not defined
in the ANSI character set.

To workaround to this problem is to edit the resource file with a Windows-based
text editor that uses the ANSI character set. Typing ALT+129 will create a
u-umlaut as desired because the editor will convert the OEM-set character to the
closest matching ANSI-set character. In this case OEM-set character position 129
maps to ANSI- set character position 252. The alternative method to specify
u-umlaut in the Windows-based editor is to type ALT+0252, using its ANSI
character set character position directly.

As another example, an application requires the square-root symbol, which does
not exist in the ANSI character set, as part of a button label. Assuming the
code page 437 is installed, and that the resource file is edited under Windows,
enter ALT+0251 in the button label because the square-root symbol is the 251st
character of the OEM character set. When the application is run, send a
WM_SETFONT message to the control, specifying an OEM-set font. An OEM-set font
is always available from the GetStockObject function through its OEM_FIXED_FONT
index.
