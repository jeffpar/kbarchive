SUMMARY
=======

Sealing Wax is a feature used by all versions of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk
Networks Gateway to Fax for incoming fax documents that are more than one page
long. Sealing Wax is actually a feature of the MailMaker form- -the Fax gateway
uses the MailMaker form for all incoming faxes. The form is included as a part
of the Fax gateway and is automatically installed on your server when the Fax
gateway is installed.

How Sealing Wax Works
---------------------

If you receive an incoming multi-page fax document, you can view the first page
(usually the cover page) by choosing the View Cover Page button in the MailMaker
read window. This usually allows you to forward the fax to the person specified
in the delivery instructions of the fax. However, you are not allowed to turn
the cover page to see the other pages of the document unless you break the
sealing wax. The only way you can break the sealing wax is to choose the View
Image File or Save Image File button.

Sealing Wax and Fax Gateway 1.1.2 (for Mail for AppleTalk Networks 2.0)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In Mail for AppleTalk Networks 2.0, a sealed incoming fax document can only be
forwarded to a single recipient. It cannot be forwarded to multiple recipients
or a group recipient. When the document is forwarded, the forwarder's copy is
automatically deleted. This means that only a single user can have access to a
copy of a sealed fax document, no matter how many times it is forwarded. If you
have a sealed MailMaker document in your mailbox in Mail for AppleTalk Networks
2.0, you can be sure that you are the only user that has it (unless it was
forwarded through a Mail for AppleTalk Networks 3.0 server - see below).

Sealing Wax and Fax Gateway 3.00a-ms (for Mail for AppleTalk Networks 3.0)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In Mail for AppleTalk Networks 3.0, a sealed document may be forwarded to
multiple recipients, group recipients, and copied or stored in any folder in a
user's Mail window. This means that many users may have a copy of the same
sealed document. The only security of a sealed document on Mail for AppleTalk
Networks 3.0 is that if any one user breaks the seal, it is broken for every
user on the same mail server. The seal will still be intact if a user on another
mail server received a copy of the sealed document. In other words, if you break
the seal on a fax document, you can be assured that you are the first user on
your mail server that has read the fax document. After the seal has been broken,
any user that has a copy of the fax document may read it.

If you are using Mail for AppleTalk Networks 3.0 and are concerned about the
security of incoming faxes, it is important for your incoming fax recipient to
control the distribution of faxes. Make sure they forward the fax document only
to those users who should see it. Also make sure they delete all copies of the
message from their mail folders after any required administrative mail archiving
has been done so that the fax documents are not available to unauthorized
personnel on an unattended workstation.
