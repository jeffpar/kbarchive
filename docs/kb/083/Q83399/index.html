SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows version 3.1's Setup automatically replaces earlier versions of
HIMEM.SYS or HIMEM.EXE with the version supplied with Windows 3.1, regardless of
whether they were from Microsoft or another company. Windows 3.1's HIMEM.SYS is
version 3.07, and supports the Lotus/Intel/Microsoft/AST eXtended Memory
Specification version 3.0.

In general, HIMEM.SYS from Microsoft is completely compatible with the HIMEM.EXE
supplied by COMPAQ. Microsoft HIMEM.SYS version 3.07 includes all functionality
found in COMPAQ HIMEM.EXE versions through 3.02 (which was the version available
at the time Windows was released).

However, COMPAQ will eventually ship a HIMEM.EXE version 3.03 which will have one
additional function not found in Microsoft HIMEM.SYS. This is the ability to
handle more than 16 MB of memory on an ISA machine. (Existing versions of
HIMEM.SYS will only support more than 16 MB of memory on EISA or MCA machines.)
This feature will be turned off by default and must be explicitly enabled to be
used. If you need this functionality, then you should continue to use the COMPAQ
HIMEM.EXE version 3.03.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
or reliability.
