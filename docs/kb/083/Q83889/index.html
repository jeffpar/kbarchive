SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses some known problems with, current versions of, and
installation of the MicroField Graphics display driver, T8.DRV.

MORE INFORMATION
================

GP Faults
---------

Some versions of the MicroField Graphics display driver, T8.DRV, cause general
protection (GP) faults in Windows Resource Kit (WRK) for Windows 3.1
applications such as SMARTDrive Monitor (SMARTMON.EXE).

Version Information
-------------------

MicroField has released five major versions of its display driver:

  Version  Date
  -------  ----
  3.14     10/13/90
  3.21     03/04/91
  3.26     12/26/92
  3.30     02-24-92
  3.32     05-07-92

Other minor releases were made between these major releases.

The MicroField installation program installs CHKVER.EXE in the Windows directory.
This program reports the version of the MicroField Graphics display driver that
is currently running.

MicroField Graphics recommends that all users upgrade to version 3.32 of its
driver. A minimum of version 3.30 is required for Windows 3.1, but version 3.30
has problems with TrueType and PowerPoint.

Display Driver Installation
---------------------------

The MicroField Graphics documentation instructs you to install a VGA or EGA
display driver when installing Windows. After you have a functioning
installation of Windows, you can use the MicroField Graphics installation
program to install its drivers. The MicroField Graphics installation program
does not use the Windows Setup program, so if you are having installation
problems, you should contact MicroField Graphics for assistance.

Obtaining Updated Display Drivers
---------------------------------

MicroField Graphics customers can obtain the current drivers from MicroField
Graphics Sales.

For additional information, please contact MicroField.
