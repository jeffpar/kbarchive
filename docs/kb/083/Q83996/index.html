The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The recommended installation procedure for version 3.1 of the Microsoft Windows
Software Development Kit (SDK) consists of the following five steps:

1. Install the final retail release of the Windows graphical operating
  environment, version 3.1.

2. Do not install the Windows SDK over another version of the Windows SDK. The
  Windows SDK installation procedure is not designed to update a previous
  version. NOTE: The Windows SDK version 3.1 can create applications compatible
  with Windows 3.0. For more information, see Chapter 3 of the "Microsoft
  Windows Software Development Kit: Getting Started" manual for version 3.1,
  starting on page 29.

  If multiple (more than one) versions of the SDK are installed on the same
  machine, each must be installed in a separate directory tree. A pair of batch
  files that change the PATH, INCLUDE, and LIB environment variables
  appropriately for the two versions of the SDK are also very helpful.

3. Make sure enough hard disk space is available. The amount of space required
  depends on the components installed and ranges between 9.6 and 24.3 megabytes
  (MB) of space. The program requires an additional 4 MB of free space for
  scratch files created in the installation process. The SDK installation
  program does not copy any files unless it detects enough free hard-disk space
  for a successful installation.

4. Run the SDK installation program to install the final retail release of the
  Windows 3.1 SDK. For more information on this procedure, see Chapter 1 of the
  "Microsoft Windows SDK: Getting Started" manual.

5. If the Windows SDK version 3.1 is used with the Microsoft C Optimizing
  Compiler, version 6.0, install the C run-time libraries and header files from
  the disk labeled "Microsoft C 6.0 Run-time Libraries" provided with the SDK.
  To install the libraries, place the disk into a drive and run the INSTALL.BAT
  file on the disk. For more information on this procedure, see page 3 of the
  "Microsoft Windows SDK: Getting Started" manual.
