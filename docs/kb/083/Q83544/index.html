The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to add additional printers to Windows, you receive the following
message:

  The information file is damaged or not in the system directory. Copy the
  control.inf file from disk #1 ...

RESOLUTION
==========

- Delete all *.INF (information) files from the Windows directory. NOTE: Do not
  delete any *.INF files from the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory.

  This error occurs if the *.INF files were placed in the Windows directory
  erroneously. This could occur due to user error, or third- party installation
  programs.

- Re-creating the WIN.INI file may also help correct this error. For more
  information about rebuilding the WIN.INI file, query on the following words
  in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  create and win.ini and without and third-party

- Open the SYSTEM.INI file in a text editor (such as Windows Notepad) and add a
  semicolon preceding the Device=SYMEVNT.386 line to disable it:

  ;Device=SYMEVNT.386   ;Added By NU8

  Restart Windows to make this change take effect. Disabling this statement does
  not allow Norton Utilities to run properly while in Windows.

  NOTE: SYMEVNT.386 is a device driver provided with Norton Utilities and Norton
  AntiVirus. Symantec has released a new version of this file that may correct
  this error. Download file NU8DRV.EXE from the Symantec bulletin board service
  (BBS).
