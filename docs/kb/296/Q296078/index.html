-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Server service (Snaservr.exe) may terminate unexpectedly on an SNA
Server or Host Integration Server (HIS) 2000 system when providing LU 6.2
sessions to APPC (Advanced Program-to-Program Communciations) applications that
call the APPC ACTIVATE_SESSION verb.

If Drwtsn32.exe is configured as the system's default debugger, the Drwtsn32.log
will be updated with information that resembles the following:

  Application exception occurred:
  App: exe\snaservr.DBG (pid=&lt;process id&gt;
  When: &lt;date&gt; @ &lt;time&gt;
  Exception number: 80000003 (hardcoded breakpoint)

The SNA or HIS 2000 server will log the following event just prior to the
application exception:

  Event ID: 102
  Source: SNA Server
  Description: (0BC6) Internal Error
  Subcode Information: X'0BC6' Free active pool is empty.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server service fails to release an internal control block that is used
for CNOS (Change Number of Sessions) negotiations for each client APPC
application that issues an ACTIVATE_SESSION verb. SNA Server and HIS 2000
support a fixed number of these special control blocks; therefore, over time
this type of control block leak leads to a situation in which there are no
available control blocks. When this occurs, the SNA Server service logs the
Event 102 Subcode X'0BC6' and terminates abnormally.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 4.0:

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0 service pack that contains this
fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server versions
4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 and Host Integration Server 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A single control block is leaked for each client connection to the SNA Server
service over which an APPC application issues an ACTIVATE_SESSION verb. A
control block is not leaked for each ACTIVATE_SESSION verb that is issued by the
application after the client connection is established.

ACTIVATE_SESSION and DEACTIVATE_SESSION support was added in SNA Server 4.0 SP2.
