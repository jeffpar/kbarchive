-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you examine the Outbound Awaiting Conversion queue of the Internet Mail
Service, messages that are already sent may still appear in the queue.

Also, the application event log reports the following event:

  Event ID: 3038
  Source: MSExchangeIMC
  Description: An attempt to remove processed messages from the outbound store
  queue has failed. The removal will be retried later. If the messages are not
  removed before the service is shutdown, the mail will be resent at service
  startup causing duplicate mail.

You may also find that messages are sent more than once to recipients who are not
within the Exchange organization.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if there is corruption on a folder level in the Internet
Mail Connector (IMC) mailbox.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, recreate the Internet Mail Service:

1. Delete the Internet Mail Service, and then recreate the In and Out folders in
  the Imcdata folder.

2. Defragment the information store.

3. Recreate the Internet Mail Service, and then check the mail flow.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior has been observed when the Exchange Server computer uses Network
Associates' GroupShield Exchange 4.0.4. You may need to change GroupShield's
scanning settings:

1. As an Exchange Administrator, go to the GroupShield properties.

2. Click the On-Access(Mailboxes) tab, and then click Exclusion List.

3. Add the IMS mailbox.

Alternatively, you can upgrade to GroupShield Exchange 4.5, which by default
scans the correct API mode.
