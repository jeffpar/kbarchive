This article discusses a Beta release of a Microsoft product. The information in this article is provided as-is and is subject to change without notice.

No formal product support is available from Microsoft for this Beta product. For information about how to obtain support for a Beta release, see the documentation that is included with the Beta product files, or check the Web location from which you downloaded the release.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the following scenario

- An Exchange 5.5-based computer is running in a Windows 2000 domain with
  Active Directory.

- The Exchange Server 5.5 directory is linked with the Active Directory
  Connector (ADC).

- You ran Exchange 2000 Setup with the forestprep option.

you encounter the following symptoms:

- When you attempt to move mailboxes, you are unable to do so, and you receive
  an "Invalid ADSI pathname" error message.

- Many users are missing homeMDB, homeMTA, or both.

- The following events are logged in the Application log:

  Event Type: Warning
  Event Source: MSADC
  Event Category: Replication
  Event ID: 8294
  Description:
  The homeMDB attribute is not present on the import object CN=&lt;DN&gt;. This
  can happen when ADC does not have permissions to see all links. Please ensure
  that the ADC has Read permissions to the all of the source directory,
  including the Microsoft Exchange Configuration Container. (Connection
  Agreement '&lt;CA Name&gt;' #1812)

  Event Type: Warning
  Event Source: MSADC
  Event Category: Replication
  Event ID: 8294
  Description:
  The homeMTA attribute is not present on the import object CN=&lt;DN&gt;. This
  can happen when ADC does not have permissions to see all links. Please ensure
  that the ADC has Read permissions to the all of the source directory,
  including the Microsoft Exchange Configuration Container. (Connection
  Agreement '&lt;CA Name&gt;' #1812)

CAUSE
=====

When you run the Exchange 2000 setup /forestprep command, the Enterprise
information is imported into Active Directory. Removing and adding several
servers into the environment after you run forestprep causes the information in
Active Directory to be out of date. Active Directory Users and Computers and the
ADC try to reference this outdated information, which results in the symptoms
that are listed in the "Symptoms" section in this article.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, add an Exchange 2000 server into the environment. By
doing so, the Site Replication Service and a Configuration Connection Agreement
are installed, which updates the information in Active Directory.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, do not make server changes after you run
forestprep.
