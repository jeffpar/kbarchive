-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Index Server version 2.0 
- Indexing Service 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A new variant of the Malformed Hit-Highlighting vulnerability
(http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS00-006.asp) has been
discovered that affects both Index Server 2.0 and Indexing Service in Microsoft
Windows 2000. The new variant has exactly the same scope as the original
vulnerability. If an attacker provides an invalid search request, he or she can
read files that reside on the Web server. The new patch eliminates all known
variants of the vulnerability.

Mitigating Factors:

- The vulnerability would only allow files to be read. File cannot be added,
  changed, or deleted through this vulnerability.

- Server-side files should not contain sensitive data. If you follow this
  recommendation, there would be no sensitive data to compromise through this
  vulnerability.

- The vulnerability would only allow files that reside on the Web server (and
  in the same logical drive as the server's root directory) to be read. It
  would not allow files elsewhere on the server, or files that reside on a
  remote server, to be read.

==========
