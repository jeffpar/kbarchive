SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to search a database using the LIKE parameter in a
Structured Query Language (SQL) statement in the Database Results Wizard of
Microsoft FrontPage.

This article assumes that you have a basic knowledge of how to query a database
using Active Server Pages (ASP) technologies in FrontPage.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When used in a search, the LIKE clause in SQL can be used to generate a result
set based on a minimum amount of information typed into the form field of a
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) form. For example, if you type "mic%" (without
the quotation marks) in the form field, the results may include Microsoft,
microphone, microwave, and so forth.

To use the Database Results Wizard to specify what you want to compare, follow
thse steps:

1. Open a Web on an Internet Information Services (IIS) Web server and create a
  new blank page.

2. On the Insert menu, point to Database, and then click Results.

3. In Step 1, choose your Data Source, and then click Next. (For example, click
  the Northwind sample connection.)

4. In Step 2, click to select Record Source, select the table from which you
  want to retrieve data, and then click Next. For this example, select the
  "Employees" table.

5. In Step 3, edit the list of fields that you want to be included in your
  query.

6. Click More Options.

7. Click Criteria.

8. Click Add.

9. In the Add Criteria dialog box, select the field name you want to compare.
  For this example, choose "Title".

10. Click the Comparison list, and select "Like" or "Not Like".

11. In the Value box, specify the form field name you will use to search with,
  and then click OK three times.

12. Click Next twice.

13. In Step 5, click to select the Add Search Form check box to have FrontPage
  automatically create a search form.

14. Click Finish.

FrontPage will generate a SQL statement like the following:

  SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE (Title LIKE '::Title::')

If you browse to the page and enter "Sales Manager" (without the quotation
marks), you will see only those records that exactly matched the search string.
If you enter "Sales%" (without the quotation marks), you will see all records
that begin with the word "Sales" (without the quotation marks). The resulting
SQL used by this query would be:

  SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE (Title Like 'Title%')

The precent sign is a wildcard character so that the LIKE string can match
multiple records.

NOTE: When you first browse the page or if the form field is blank when you
submit the form, no records from the database will be returned. However, you can
enter a value of a single precent sign and all records will be returned.
