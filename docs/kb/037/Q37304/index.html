If you specify a library directory name that contains a minus sign
(such as LIB-BAS) during the SETUP.EXE program for Microsoft BASIC
Compiler Version 6.00 or 6.00b, or Microsoft BASIC Professional
Development System (PDS) Version 7.00, the LIB.EXE manager may have
problems creating the BASIC stand-alone and run-time libraries.

This problem occurs because when the Library Manager (LIB) is run from
the SETUP program, it uses the pathname to your library directory in
its "Operations:+" step and is confused by an operator (such as "-")
in the directory name.

For example, if you specified the directory name C:\LIB-BAS for your
BASIC libraries, a library build would look like the following:

   Microsoft (R) Library Manager  Version 3.11
   Copyright (C) Microsoft Corp 1983-1988.  All rights reserved.

   Library name:BRUN60ER.LIB
   Library does not exist.  Create? (y/n) Y
   Operations:+ C:\LIB-BAS\BRUN60R.LIB
   LIB : error V2155: BAS\BRUN60ER.LIB : module not in library; ignored
   &amp;
   Operations:+ .\B4 ;
   LIB : error V2157: C:\LIB.obj : cannot access file

The LIB thinks the "-" character in the LIB-BAS directory is an extra
operation trying to subtract BAS\BRUN60ER.LIB. It then tries to add a
file called C:\LIB.obj, which does not exist.

Then, when trying to compile a BASIC program and link it with the
BRUN60ER.LIB library, the compile will seem to work correctly, but the
link can return errors, such as the following:

   LINK : warning L4021: no stack segment
   LINK : error L2029: Unresolved externals:
     &lt; here would be a list of the unresolved library references &gt;

If you avoid the following operators in the directory name for BASIC
libraries, the LIB shouldn't have any problems initially creating the
libraries:

   +  -  -+  *  -*
