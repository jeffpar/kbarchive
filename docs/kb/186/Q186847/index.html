- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word 97, when you open a Microsoft Word 98 Macintosh Edition
document containing Unicode characters that are beyond the 256th character (512
bytes) of the document, those Unicode characters are not converted correctly
(they will be displayed as "garbage" characters).

CAUSE
=====

The converter for Unicode characters fails to correctly read characters after
the 256th character of the document.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, obtain Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 2 (SR-2).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Office 97
Service Release 2 (SR-2).

For additional information about SR-2, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

Unicode is a 16-bit character set designed to cover all the world's major living
languages in addition to scientific symbols and dead languages that are the
subject of scholarly interest. It eliminates the complexity of multi-byte
character sets that are currently used on UNIX and Windows to support Asian
languages. A consortium of companies including Apple, Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard
(HP), Digital, and IBM created Unicode. These companies used information from
the ISO-10646 standard to produce a single standard in 1993. Unicode is the
basis for the Windows NT operating system.

Unicode is a 16-bit character set where all characters occupy the same space. The
first 256 values are the same as the ISO-Latin character set, which is also the
basis for the ANSI character set used in Windows 3.1 and Windows 95. However,
Unicode defines 34,168 distinct coded characters. In most character sets a
single value is often assigned to several characters. For example, in ASCII a
"-" is used to represent a hyphen, a minus sign, a dash, and a non-breaking
hyphen. In Unicode, each meaning is given its own code; that is, a hyphen is
represented by a character different from a minus sign, and so forth. The
Unicode standard contains only one instance of each character and assigns it a
unique name and code value. It also supports "combining" accent characters,
which follow the base character that they are to modify.
