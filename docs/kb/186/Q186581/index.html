- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

The following event 152 appears in the application event log when messages are
filtered based on the O/R address of the originator. This event is recorded,
even when diagnostics logging is set to none.


  EVENT ID:  152
  Originator
  DN:/o=ORGANIZATION/ou=ABRAVES/cn=RECIPIENTS/cn=FREDF&lt;A7&gt;C=US;A=
  ;P=Organization;O=ABRAVES;S=FredF;OU1=bogus1;OU2=bogus2; barred by rule
  o=ABRAVES; on link/gateway
  /O=ORGANIZATION/OU=CTIGERS/CN=CONFIGURATION/CN=CONNECTIONS/CN=X400 TO
  ABRAVES.
  MTS-ID C=US;A= ;P=Organization;L=SERVER2-980601172533Z-9. [MTA XFER-IN
  12
  40] (14)

If the originator is configured to receive a non-delivery report (NDR), the text
of the NDR is as follows:

  Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

     Subject: testing filtering
     Sent: 6/1/98 1:15:12 PM

  The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

     User 1 on 6/1/98 1:17:01 PM
           The recipient was unavailable to take delivery of the message
           MSEXCH:MSExchangeMTA:CTIGERS:SERVER1.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

Under certain conditions, you may want to filter messages based on the O/R
address of the originator. The Microsoft Message Transfer Agent (MTA) in version
5.5 Service Pack 1 allows you to do this.

In order to filter the messages, the following registry keys must be added.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

1. Start Regedt32.exe and locate the registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
   \MSExchangeMTA\Parameters
 

2. On the Edit menu, click Add Key, and add the following entry:

     Key Name: &lt; Common-Name of the X.400-Link on which you want to filter
                 in-bound mail (for example, X400 TO ABRAVES).&gt;
     Class:  &lt;leave blank&gt;
 

3. Under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
  \MSExchangeMTA\Parameters\X400 TO ABRAVES

  add the following values:

  a. 

        Value Name: Bar P1 Originator
        Data Type:  REG_MULTI_SZ
        Data: series of O/R Address substrings.
      

     (For example, p=Microsoft;s=admin; make sure they are separated by a
     semicolon.)

  b. 

        Value Name: NDR to barred originator
        Data Type:  REG_DWORD
        Data: &lt;non zero value&gt;.
   

This value determines whether the originator gets an NDR or not. If the value is
set to zero or absent, the messages are dropped and no NDR is sent. However,
event ID: 152 is recorded in the application log.

NOTES:

- The values are case sensitive and should be entered exactly as shown above,
  including spaces.

- The changes made for either Bar P1 Originator or NDR to Barred Originator are
  dynamic and do not require restart of the MTA.

- If you want to filter on any OU value, you also must include any superior
  OUs. For example, ou2=Branch Office; is not valid, but ou1=Sales;ou2=Branch
  Office; is okay. This is because the OUs are strictly hierarchical;
  therefore, inferior OUs make no sense outside the context of their superiors.

- If you want to filter messages from additional X.400 Connectors, add the same
  registry keys as above.

- You can also filter messages from another replicated Exchange site connected
  over an X.400 Connector.
