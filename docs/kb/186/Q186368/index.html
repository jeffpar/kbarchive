-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A General Protection Fault occurs when you run a form from the form designer.
Under Windows 95, the following message appears:

  This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.

If the problem persists, contact the program vendor.

Under Windows NT 4.0, the following message appears:

  The instruction at "0xnnnnnnnn" referenced memory at "0xnnnnnnnn." The memory
  could not be "read."

Click on OK to terminate the application.
Click on Cancel to debug the application.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because a QUIT command executed while the form designer was
open. The problem is not limited to form methods or events.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not issue a QUIT command in a form's events or methods while in the Form
Designer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This has been corrected in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

WARNING: Before attempting to reproduce this behavior, it is strongly recommended
that you close any open tables.

1. Using Visual FoxPro 5.0, create a new form.

2. In the form's Destroy event, add the following code:

        QUIT

3. Close the Code window.

4. Select Form, Run Form from the Menu bar.

5. Click the form's Close button AND NOTE THAT a General Protection Fault
  occurs.
