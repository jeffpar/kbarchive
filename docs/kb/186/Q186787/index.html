-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to view the Exchange Server Internet Mail Service properties in
the Exchange Server Administrator program, one of the following error messages
may be displayed:

  Extension 'SMTP' could not be loaded.
  The error 87 occurred while formatting windows NT error 182.
  Microsoft Windows NT ID No 0xc00200b6

  -or-

  Extension 'SMTP' could not be loaded.
  The specified module could not be found.
  Microsoft Windows NT
  ID no: 0xc002007e

CAUSE
=====

The error messages in the "Symptoms" section of this article occur if the
Mfc42.dll file is missing or corrupted.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, copy the Mfc42.dll file from the Exchange Server CD
to the &lt;SystemRoot&gt;\System32 subfolder of the computer running the
Exchange Server Administrator program.

Additional Workaround
---------------------

Make sure that the Add-ins subfolder is shared.

NOTE: You may need to check all of the drives for the drive that contains the
shared folders under this subfolder. The standard shared subfolders in the
Exchsrvr folder are: Add-ins, Address, Connect, RES, and Tracking.log.

If the Add-ins subfolder is not shared, share it as follows:

1. In Windows Explorer, click the Exchsrvr\Add-ins subfolder.

2. Right-click the subfolder, and then click Sharing.

3. In the Add-ins Properties dialog box, click Share As. Make sure that the
  Share name and Comment boxes contain the following information:

  Share name: Add-ins

  Comment: "Access to EDK objects" (with the quotation marks)

4. Click Permissions. Make sure that the "Access through share permissions"
  dialog box has the following permissions set:

  Everyone (which is a global group - with the globe icon) as Read
  &lt;Exchange Server service account name&gt; (individual icon) as Full
  Control
  &lt;Local administrators&gt; (local group icon) as Full Control

5. Click OK.

6. Click Apply, and then click OK.

This permission may be turned off during a service pack update or a
reinstallation, which can cause this problem.

MORE INFORMATION
