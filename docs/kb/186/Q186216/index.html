-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When an Exchange user sends a message with an attachment to a Lotus cc:Mail
mailing list that includes Exchange recipients, the date is appended to the end
of the attachment name when the message arrives in the Exchange recipients'
mailboxes.

CAUSE
=====

This is a problem in the hrParseFileName() function. This function assumes that
the date following the file name is always in MM/DD/YY format. However, for
dates such as 1/1/98, the format is actually M/D/YY. The parsing algorithm does
not handle these correctly and fails for all dates with a single-digit month or
day with the symptom listed above.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the following fix or wait for the next Exchange
service pack.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
