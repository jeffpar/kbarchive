SYMPTOMS
========

After dropping the MonthView ActiveX control onto a form, the control resizes
itself after losing focus. Only part of the control is visible either in design
mode or at run-time. Trying to resize the MonthView ActiveX control by dragging
the control's handles results in the control snapping to a certain size, and any
other attempts appear to have no effect at all in resizing the control. Changing
the Height and Width properties also appear to have no effect after resizing the
control once. When the form runs, the border around the MonthView ActiveX
control appears resized but the size of the control remains the same.

RESOLUTION
==========

You should resize the MonthView ActiveX control using only the Font.Size
property.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Normally, when resizing a control located on a form at design-time, you would
click on the control and drag one of the handles or change the Height and Width
properties to resize it. Doing this to the MonthView ActiveX control results in
resizing the border around the control. Of course, the Appearance property of
the MonthView ActiveX control must be set to "3D," which is the default.

After resizing the MonthView control once, any attempts to resize the control
again have no effect because the size of the control or its border do not change
visually while in design mode. If the form is run, then the border of the
MonthView ActiveX control will be resized, either covering part of the control
or being expanded to an area larger than the control, depending on which way it
was resized. Use the Font.Size property to resize the control. You can change
the Font.Size property at design-time or during run-time.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form and add the MonthView ActiveX control to it by clicking the
  ActiveX Control (OleControl) icon on the Form Controls toolbar and dropping
  it on the form.

2. In the Insert Object dialog box, select the Create Control button, then
  scroll down the Object Type list box and choose the Microsoft MonthView
  control.

3. Click the form to make the MonthView ActiveX control lose focus and note that
  the control changes size and only part of the control can now be seen.

4. Grab the lower-right handle on the MonthView ActiveX control and drag it down
  and to the right. Note that the control resizes once and any other attempts
  to resize it seem to have no effect. Run the form and observe that the border
  may be larger than the control itself depending on how far the handle was
  dragged.

5. Modify the form, drop a spinner control onto the form, and then add the
  following code to the respective events:

  Spinner Init event:

           This.Value = ThisForm.OleControl1.Object.Font.Size

  Spinner InterActiveChange Event:

           ThisForm.OleControl1.Object.Font.Size = This.Value

6. Run the form and change the value in the spinner. Note that the MonthView
  ActiveX control changes its size according to the value of the spinner.
