-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Schedule+, versions 7.0, 7.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With Microsoft Schedule+, you may get the following error when attempting to
modify your own schedule:

  The new item could not be inserted. The schedule is being used by someone
  else. Try again later.

CAUSE
=====

Someone with access permissions to your Schedule file is in the process of
receiving data from your file on the server. This activity places a record-
level lock on your schedule file while the data is downloading.

WORKAROUND
==========

Ensure that users who have permissions to your schedule do not connect over slow
access links, such as telephone lines, or ask that they open your schedule only
when necessary rather than keeping it open all the time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When others have your schedule open but are not actively using it, the server
can still initiate the download when new data is available. This ties up your
schedule file even if other users have read-only permissions.

This problem is more likely to occur with a large schedule accessed by several
users over slow telephone lines.
