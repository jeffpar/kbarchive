SYMPTOMS
========

When performing a two-step migration from Microsoft Mail for PC Networks to
Exchange Server, selecting to migrate a user's mail and address book information
in the Migration Wizard may cause the migration to fail with the following Event
ID:

  EventID: 7017
  Source: MSExchangeMig
  Type: Error
  Category: None
  Description:

  Could not log onto the Message Store for Account: &lt;username&gt;

CAUSE
=====

This error will occur when the MS Mail user already has an existing Exchange
Server mailbox with an alias name that is different than the MS Mail mailbox
name.

WORKAROUND
==========

When performing a two-step migration from MS Mail to Exchange Server while the
user already has an existing Exchange Server mailbox, the following steps need
to be taken:

1. Using a text editor or Excel, edit the Mode field in the .csv file so that
  the field is blank. This, in effect, performs an Update function.

2. Edit the Common-Name field in the .csv file so that the name matches the
  Directory Name for the existing mailbox. (Usually the alias name is the
  directory name; checking Raw Mode Properties will confirm.)

  WARNING: Using the raw mode of the Exchange Server Administrator program
  (admin/r) incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to
  reinstall Microsoft Windows NT Server and/or Microsoft Exchange Server.
  Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of
  raw mode can be solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.

  You can check the Raw Properties of a mailbox by starting the Microsoft
  Exchange Administrator program in Raw Mode. To do this:

  a. Start the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program in raw mode by
     typing the following at a command prompt:

  admin/r

  b. Select the mailbox and from the File menu, click Raw Properties.

3. During the second step of the two-step migration, in the dialog that comes up
  after choosing the .csv file, clear the Information to Create Mailboxes check
  box.

4. If asked to create a Windows NT account, do not create one.

Following these steps will allow you to migrate a user's mail and address book
information from an MS Mail (PC) account to an existing Exchange Server
mailbox.
