SUMMARY
=======

Some applications do not have the flexibility for users to specify their home
directory or some other private directory for saving files. Also, an
administrator may want to use a common directory for related files. In either of
these cases, the administrator may want to secure the files in the common
directory. For example, if you want to secure a common folder so that only the
user who created a file or administrators can view the file, you can set the
NTFS permissions on the common folder to:

  Administrators   Full Control
  Creator/Owner    Full Control

Any files that are created in or copied into the common folder will inherit the
default folder permissions, so that only admininstrators and the owner of a file
can access that file.

In a Terminal Server environment, if only Terminal Server Clients will access
this common folder, only NTFS permissions need to be set. If the folder is
shared for network access, then the share permissions can be set to:

  Everyone   Full Control

When both share-level permissions and NTFS permissions are specified for a
folder, whichever set of permissions is most restrictive will apply. In this
case, the NTFS permissions are more restrictive, and a file could only be
accessed by administrators and the user who created and owns the file.
