-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The problem occurs in the following scenario: UserA (on server A) has delivery
set to a PST file and the Empty the Deleted Items Folder Upon Exit option is not
selected. UserB is any user in the organization. UserB logs on to his or her
mailbox and sends UserA a message with a Read receipt. When UserA reads the
message, UserB receives a receipt with a status of Read. When the IS maintenance
runs on the server, UserB receives another receipt with a status of "not read".
The second receipt, which states:

  The message was deleted without being read.

makes it unclear to UserB whether UserA actually read the message. Because the IS
maintenance can be configured, the second receipt can be received days after the
first receipt.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the following fix or wait for the next Exchange
service pack.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
