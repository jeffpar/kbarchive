-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The CHANGE command replaces CHGLOGON, CHGUSER, and CHGPORT from Citrix
Winframe.

The change utilities are used to change current settings. The change command can
invoke any one of the change utilities.

change [logon | port | user] [/?]

/? (help): Displays the syntax for the command and information about the
command's options.

CHANGE LOGON
------------

Disables all logons for system maintenance.

Syntax:

change logon [/enable] [/disable] [/query] [/?]

Parameters:

none

/enable

  Enables logons from client sessions, but not from the console.

/disable

  Disables subsequent logons from client sessions, but not from the console.
  Currently logged on users are not affected.

/query

  Displays the current logon status.

/? (help)

  Displays the syntax for the command and information about the command's
  options.

Security Restrictions:

Only administrators can run CHANGE LOGON.

CHANGE LOGON -- Additional Notes:

The change logon command disables logons from client sessions other than the
system console. Users that are currently logged on are not affected. Client
sessions are always re-enabled when you restart the system. If you are connected
to the Terminal Server from a remote location and disable client sessions, and
if you log off before re-enabling client sessions, you will not be able to
reconnect. You need to logon at the system console in order to re-enable
sessions.

CHANGE PORT
-----------

Changes the COM port mappings to be compatible with DOS applications.

Syntax:

change portchange port COMx=COMychange port /d COMxchange port [/?]

Parameters:

COMx=COMyMaps COM port x to port y.

/d COMx

  Deletes the mapping for COM port COMx.

/? (help)

  Displays the syntax for the command and information about the command's
  options.

CHANGE PORT -- Additional Notes:

Most MS-DOS applications support only COM1 though COM4 serial ports. CHANGE PORT
maps a serial port to a different port number, allowing applications that cannot
access high-numbered COM ports to access the serial port. For example, to map
COM12 to COM1 for use by a MS-DOS application, type change port com12=com1.
Remapping works only for the current session and is not retained if you logoff
and then log on again.

Run CHANGE PORT without any parameters to display the available COM ports and the
current COM port mappings.

CHANGE USER
-----------

Changes the .ini file mapping setting.

Syntax:

change user [/install | /execute | /query] [/?]

Parameters:

none

/install

  Disables the ability to map the .ini files in the home directory. All .ini
  files are read and written to the Terminal Server system directory. You must
  disable .ini file mapping when installing applications on a Terminal Server.
  See the Notes section below for details.

/execute

  Enables the ability to map.ini files to the home directory. This is the
  default setting.

/query

  Displays the current .ini file mapping setting.

/? (help)

  Displays the syntax for the command and information about the command's
  options.

CHANGE USER -- Additional Notes:

Use change user /install before installing an application to create .ini files
for the application in the Terminal Server system directory. These files are
used as master copies for the user-specific .ini files. After installing the
application, use change user /execute to revert to normal .ini file mapping.

The first time you run the application, the application looks in the home
directory for its .ini files. If the .ini files are not found in the home
directory, but are found in the Terminal Server system directory, the Terminal
Server copies the .ini files to the home directory. This ensures that each user
has a unique copy of the application's .ini files. Any new .ini files are
created in the home directory. Each user should have a unique (user-specific)
copy of the .ini files for an application to avoid instances where several users
have incompatible application setups; for example, different default directories
or screen resolutions.

When the system is put into install mode (change user /install), several things
happen. All Registry entries that are created are shadowed under
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Terminal
Server\Install.

Keys added to HKEY_CURRENT_USER are copied under the Software key and keys added
to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE are copied under MACHINE. If the application queries the
Windows directory (using system calls like GetWindowsDirectory), the Terminal
Server returns the %systemroot% directory. If any .ini file entries are added
(using system calls such as WritePrivateProfileString), they are added to the
.ini files under the %systemroot% directory.

When the system is put back in execution mode (change user /execute),and the
application tries to read a Registry entry under HKEY_CURRENT_USER that doesn't
exist, the Terminal Server checks to see if a copy of the key exists under the
TerminalServer\Install section of the Registry. If it does, the keys are copied
to the appropriate location under HKEY_CURRENT_USER. If the application tries to
read from an .ini file that doesn't exist, the Terminal Server looks for that
.ini file under the system root. If the .ini file is in the system root, it is
copied to the home directory\Windows. If the application queries the Windows
directory, the Terminal Server returns the home directory\Windows.

When you log on, the Terminal Server checks to see if the system .ini files are
newer than the .ini files on your computer. If the system version is newer, your
.ini file is replaced with the newer version or the new entries in the system
version are merged into your .ini file. This depends on whether or not the
INISYNC bit, 0x40, is set for this .ini file. See the Advanced Installation
Topics section of the on-line help for additional information. Your previous
version of the .ini file is renamed to Inifile.ctx. If the system Registry
values under Install\ are newer than your version under HKEY_CURRENT_USER, then
your version of the keys is deleted and replaced with the new keys from under
Install\.
