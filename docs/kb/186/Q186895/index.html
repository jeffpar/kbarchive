-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- The AppWizard, included with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A new, Custom AppWizard project exhibits one of the following two problems if it
is based on an existing application that has context-sensitive Help support:

- If the existing application has been built already, the Custom AppWizard
  reports the following error after the Finish button is clicked to create the
  project:

  The select project contains two or more files with the same filename in
  different directories and therefore cannot be used to create a custom
  AppWizard. This is most likely caused by the project containing a subproject.


- After resolving the first problem, or if the existing application has NOT
  been built, Custom AppWizard finishes with no error. A project generated from
  this new Custom AppWizard build with no errors, but the resulting application
  has no Help file. The following error message appears when Help Topics is
  clicked from the application's Help menu:

  Cannot find the &lt;exe_path&gt;\&lt;exe_name&gt;.hlp file. Do you want to
  try to find this file yourself?

  Choosing No causes the following error report:

  Cannot find the &lt;exe_path&gt;\&lt;exe_name&gt;.hlp Help file. Check to see
  that the file exists on your disk. If it doesn't, you need to reinstall it."

CAUSE
=====

Problem 1: Custom AppWizard Error
---------------------------------

Custom AppWizard sees two .hlp files and two .cnt files in the new project.

Problem 2: No Help File Produced
--------------------------------

Two distinct problems cause this symptom:

- The new Custom AppWizard does not make custom build settings for its
  projects' .hpj file. Therefore, the project build does not launch
  Makehelp.bat to build the help files.

- The project's .hpj file refers to invalid file paths.

RESOLUTION
==========

The workarounds below resolve both problems.

Problem 1: Custom AppWizard Error
---------------------------------

Delete the .hlp file and the .cnt file from the existing application's project's
HLP\ folder. The Custom AppWizard should now finish without error.

Problem 2: No Help File Produced
--------------------------------

1. Open the project generated from the new Custom AppWizard.

2. On the Project menu, click Settings.

3. In the Settings dialog box, expand the project tree and select the project's
  .hpj file under the Source Files folder.

4. In the Settings For list, click All Configurations.

5. Click the Custom Build tab.

6. In the Description box, type, "Making help file..." (without the quotation
  marks).

7. In the Build command(s) box, enter the following text:

        call "$(ProjDir)\makehelp.bat"

8. In the Output file(s) box, enter the following text:

        $(OutDir)\$(TargetName).hlp

9. Click OK to save the settings and exit the dialog box.

10. Open the project's .hpj file in the Visual C++ IDE. Modify the following
  lines, replacing "project_name" and "project_path" with the correct values
  for the new project:

        [OPTIONS]
        ...
        HLP=project_name.HLP
        ERRORLOG=project_name.LOG
        ...
        [MAP]
        ...
        #include &lt;project_path\project_name\hlp\project_name.hm

  For example, for a project named TESTING that resides in the C:\ directory:

        [OPTIONS]
        ...
        HLP=TESTING.HLP
        ERRORLOG=TESTING.LOG
        ...
        [MAP]
        ...
        #include &lt;C:\TESTING\hlp\TESTING.hm&gt;

11. Save the changes, and close the file.

Rebuild and run the application. Context help should now function correctly.

To permanently fix the invalid file paths problem for a Custom AppWizard, edit
the root.hpj file in its project "Template Files" folder. Modify the following
lines exactly as indicated (the macros bracketed by $$ are case- sensitive):

     [OPTIONS]
     ...
     HLP=$$root$$.HLP
     ERRORLOG=$$root$$.LOG
     ...
     [MAP]
     ...
     #include &lt;$$FULL_DIR_PATH$$hlp\$$root$$.hm&gt;

Save the root.hpj template file and rebuild the Custom AppWizard project. New
projects generated from this Custom AppWizard now contain the correct file
paths, making steps 10 and 11 above unnecessary. However, the custom build step
must still be adjusted manually.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++,
version 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Problem 1: Custom AppWizard Error
---------------------------------

1. Create an AppWizard MFC application with context-sensitive help.

2. Build the application.

3. Create a Custom AppWizard application based on an existing project; use the
  project created in step 1 as the "based-on" project.

RESULT: The Custom AppWizard displays the error noted above.

Problem 2: No Help File Produced
--------------------------------

1. Create an AppWizard MFC application with context-sensitive help.

2. Do not build it; create a Custom AppWizard based on this existing project.

3. Build the new Custom AppWizard.

4. On the File menu, click New.

5. Click the Projects tab, and select the newly built Custom AppWizard as the
  project type.

6. Build and run this new application.

7. From the application's Help menu, click Help Topics.

RESULT: The error messages described above appear.
