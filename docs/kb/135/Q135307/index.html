                               of new controls available, such as timers,
                               grids, tabbed dialogs, and so on, and it
                               demonstrates how to use familiar objects in
                               the new OOP methodology.

                               you see the code and find out how a
                               particular feature was implemented, while
                               the Case Study provides a summary of the
                               design and implementation methodology used.

Sample Client-Server       X    Provides an example of an application

                               form, refreshing remote data on demand, and
                               handlng errors. Run Main.prg in the
                               \Samples\Csapp subdirectory to connect to
                               the SQL Server sample database "Pubs" by
