-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Foundation Classes included with the versions of Visual C++ listed
at the beginning of this article do not provide any support for creating OLE
control containers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The OLE Control Development Kit (CDK) provides the ability to create OLE
controls which can be used in OLE control containers such as Microsoft Visual
FoxPro version 3.0 and Microsoft Access version 2.0. However, current versions
of MFC and Visual C++ do not provide any support for creating OLE control
containers.

The next major version of Visual C++, currently planned for release in the fall
of 1995, will provide support for creating OLE control containers.

REFERENCES
==========

Here are sources of information regarding creating an OLE control container:

- "Notes on Implementing an OLE Control Container"

  This article by Kraig Brockschmidt can be found on the Microsoft Developer
  Network CD (MSDN). It discusses the OLE control container architecture and
  provides sample code that illustrates how to implement an OLE control
  container.

- "Implementing OLE Control Containers with MFC and the OLE Control Developer's
  Kit"

  This article by Mike Blaszczak can be found on the MSDN CD and in the April
  1995 issue of the "Microsoft Systems Journal." It discusses different types
  of OLE control container support and provides sample code for an OLE control
  container.

- "CONTROLS: Demonstrates How to Test OLE Controls"

  This article can be found on the MSDN CD and in the February 1995 issue of
  the Microsoft Systems Journal. It includes a sample application that
  implements a version of the MFC DRAWCLI sample that has been modified to
  provide OLE control containment.

These articles and samples provide very useful information regarding creating OLE
control containers. However, because the current versions of Visual C++ and MFC
do not provide any support for creating OLE control containers, these samples
are provided as is, with no additional support.

Microsoft Developer Support does not currently provide any support for the
creation or implementation of OLE control containers. Because the next major
version of Visual C++ will provide a fully supported OLE control container
implementation, Microsoft recommends that developers wait for this release
unless they have an immediate need for OLE control containment.
