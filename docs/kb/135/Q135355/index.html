The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, on platform(s):
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a Local APPC LU / Remote APPC LU partnership is defined in the SNA Server
configuration file, SNA Server automatically negotiates the parallel session
limit with the remote system when the connection that owns the Remote APPC LU is
started. This negotiation occurs over an SNASVCMG mode session between these
APPC LUs, using the Change Number of Sessions (CNOS) command as defined by IBM
SNA architecture.

When a large number of APPC LUs are configured in SNA Server and SNA Server is
started, SNA Server builds the SNASVCMG mode BIND messages and CNOS commands for
all these LU/LU/mode partnerships and queues them internally until they can be
processed. If there are so many partnerships that the internal SNA Server queue
becomes exhausted, SNA Server logs the following event in the Windows NT
application event log:

  Event 11 (1178) Initialization Failure
  1178 = Insufficient resources for automatic session limit negotiation

After this error occurs, the SNA Server service terminates.


CAUSE
=====

SNA Server interprets this condition as a fatal error, causing the SNA Server
service (SNASERVR.EXE) to generate an SNA Server dump file.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can correct this problem by installing an SNA Server 2.11 fix that is now
available. This fix reduces the severity of the error so that SNA Server
attempts to recover from the condition, rather than failing. Microsoft has
updated the file SNASERVR.EXE to correct this problem.

To work around the problem without installing the fix:

- Reduce the number of APPC LU partnerships.

  Using the SNA Server Admin program, select each Local APPC LU, choose the
  Partners button, and delete any LU/LU/mode partnerships that are not being
  used. When the Enable Automatic Partnering checkbox is selected on an APPC LU
  or Mode, this can cause extra LU/LU partnerships that are not intended.

- Reduce the number of automatically activated sessions.

  Within the SNA Server APPC mode definition, the Automatic Activation Limit can
  be configured to automatically bind a specified number of LU6.2 sessions when
  the connection is started. Automatically starting an LU6.2 session ahead of
  time makes the session immediately available for an LU6.2 conversation.
  However, the overhead necessary to start an LU6.2 session is often
  negligible, so automatic session activation is often unnecessary.

  Reducing the automatic activation limit will reduce the number of BIND
  messages that SNA Server will queue internally.

- Defer CNOS processing until sessions are needed.

  The SNA Server service can be configured to defer the APPC LU CNOS processing
  until the LU sessions are actually requested by APPC applications. This
  feature can be enabled using the following registry entry:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
     \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SnaServr\Parameters
     NOINITCNOS: REG_SZ: YES

  This setting will cause SNA Server to defer CNOS processing until an APPC
  application allocates a conversation over an APPC LU pair.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
