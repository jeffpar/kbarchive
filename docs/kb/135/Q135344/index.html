SYMPTOMS
========

If you install your third-party network interface card (NIC) driver (provided by
your NIC manufacturer on floppy disk) during the original installation of
Windows NT, and then upgrade to a later version of Windows NT using the CD-ROM,
the following message appears when you attempt to install the updated NIC
driver:

  Please insert the disk labeled:
  "&lt;NIC Driver Disk Name&gt;" into &lt;CD-ROM drive&gt;:

You are not allowed to change the drive letter to the NIC driver's source disk.
Therefore you must choose Cancel and exit Windows NT Setup.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs due to text in the NIC information file (OEMSETUP.INF). The
text should instruct Windows NT to prompt the user for the correct path to
install the updated driver. The problem occurs during the upgrade because during
the original installation of Windows NT, Setup copied OEMSETUP.INF to
%SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\OEMNADx.INF, where x is a number designating the quantity
of third-party drivers you have installed on your computer.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Find the OEMNADx.INF file corresponding to your NIC driver in the original
  Windows NT installation.

2. Rename the NIC driver information file in the %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32 directory
  to another file name. For example, rename OEMNADx.INF to OEMNADx.PSS.

3. Upgrade to the later version of Windows NT.

4. Rename the OEMNADx.PSS file to OEMNADx.INF so you can configure or change NIC
  settings.
