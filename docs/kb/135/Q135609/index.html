SYMPTOMS
========

If the Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) service is installed on a Remote
Access (RAS) server that has a multiport adapter, such as a Digiboard or a
Chiliports, it usually fails to start.

The event log contains multiple WINS errors. There is no pattern to the errors in
the event log, but they are usually related to the WINS service failing to
start. The WINS service may run correctly until a seventh modem is added to the
server. At this point, the WINS service fail. If six or fewer modems are used,
the WINS service seems to function normally, but may still fail.

Errors in the system log may include:

  Event ID: 4146

  WINS error 33 processes cannot access file because another process has locked
  the file

  7023: THE WINDOWS INTERNET NAME SERVICE TERMINATED WITH THE FOLLOWING ERROR:
  (No error information is given in the message.)

In all cases, the WINS service does not start.

CAUSE
=====

The failure occurs because WINS does not allocate enough storage while reading
the registry value for the Export key under Linkage for NetBT.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

- Use six or fewer modems on the RAS/WINS server.

  -or-

- Separate the RAS and WINS services (move the WINS service to a separate
  computer).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.50 and
3.51.


A supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression- tested and should
be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are
severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the service pack release containing this fix. Contact Microsoft Product
Support Services for more information.
