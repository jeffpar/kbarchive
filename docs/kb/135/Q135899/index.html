MS-DOS-BASED AND WINDOWS-BASED PROGRAMS
=======================================

NOTE: All of the following references to software deal with the
versions that were available at the time Windows 95 shipped. New
versions may now be available. For updated information about any
of the issues described here, contact your software vendor.

Animated Icons
--------------
Windows 95 does not support animated icons.

Microsoft MS-DOS Utilities Running Under Windows 95
---------------------------------------------------
The MS-DOS utilities that are installed into the \Windows\Command
directory have been enhanced to work with Windows 95. The disk repair
utilities that shipped with older versions of MS-DOS should not be
used with Windows 95. Most of the other MS-DOS utilities that worked
with Windows 3.1 should continue to work with Windows 95, but if they
were bound to an older version of MS-DOS, you may need to use the
SETVER command to enable them.

The following MS-DOS utility files will be deleted after you upgrade
from an earlier version of Windows:
    Defrag.hlp
    Mwundel.exe
    Mwundel.hlp
    Networks.txt
    OS2.txt

The following MS-DOS utility files will be upgraded after you upgrade
from an earlier version of Windows:
    Ansi.sys
    Attrib.exe
    Chkdsk.exe
    Choice.com
    Country.sys
    Debug.exe
    Deltree.exe
    Diskcopy.com
    Display.sys
    Doskey.com
    Edit.com
    Ega.cpi
    Fc.exe

    Smartdrv.exe

Re-installing Programs
----------------------
If you upgrade your existing Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups
directory to Windows 95, then you do not need to re-install your
programs. If you install Windows 95 to a new directory, then you must
re-install all of your Windows-based programs. Copying files from your
Windows 3.1 directory to Windows 95 is not sufficient.

MS-DOS-Based Programs
---------------------
Your existing MS-DOS-based programs should run from Windows 95. If you
experience problems with an MS-DOS-based program, you can set it up to
run in an MS-DOS environment.

To run an MS-DOS-based program in an MS-DOS environment (MS-DOS mode):
1. Create a shortcut to the MS-DOS-based program.
2. Right click the shortcut icon, and then select Properties.
3. Click the Program tab, and then click Advanced.
4. Make sure that the MS-DOS Mode box is checked.

When you run a program in MS-DOS mode, it will force Windows 95 to
shut down and will load the program in an MS-DOS environment. Note
that you will not have access to devices that require protected-mode
drivers.

If you find an MS-DOS-based program slowing down or stopping when it
is in the background:
1. Right click the MS-DOS Prompt icon on the taskbar, and then click
  Properties.
2. Click the Misc tab.
3. Drag the Idle Sensitivity slider toward Low.
4. In the Background area, make sure that Always Suspend is not
  checked.

Anti-Virus Software
-------------------
Existing Anti-Virus software should be able to detect, but not always
clean, viruses while running on Windows 95. This depends on where the
virus was found and how the program chose to clean it. Also, virus
shields may not be able to see all file activity, and therefore
could miss some virus activity. It is recommended that you update
your anti-virus software to a version that was designed to run with
Windows 95.

To contact McAfee for information about their new anti-virus software:
McAfee BBS:(408) 988-4004, McAfee direct line: (408) 988-3832.

To contact Symantec Corporation for information about their anti-virus
software: (800) 441-7234 or (541) 334-6054.

Disk Repair and Optimization Utilities
--------------------------------------
To make it possible to store long filenames on a FAT volume, it was
necessary to change the file system for Windows 95. Those changes will
prevent most existing disk repair and optimization programs from
functioning correctly. Depending on how they function, Windows may
block them from executing in order to protect the data on your disk.
This is necessary in a multi-tasking environment to prevent disk
corruption caused by multiple utilities running simultaneously. It is
strongly recommended that you upgrade to disk repair software that was
designed for Windows 95. For more information, contact your software
vendor.

Disk-Compression Utilities
--------------------------
Windows 95 works with most major disk-compression products. However,
since many of these products come with optimization utilities, it is
recommended that you upgrade to the version designed for Windows 95.
For more information, contact your software vendor.

Windows 3.1 Shell Enhancements
------------------------------
Most Windows 3.1 shell replacements will still run on Windows 95, but
with many limitations because of the taskbar, 32-bit components, and
the new Windows 95 shell. If you want to continue running one of these
programs, you should upgrade to a version that was designed to run
with Windows 95.

Major Windows 3.1 shell enhancements this may affect: Norton Desktop,
PC Tools Desktop, Tabworks, Dashboard, and Direct Access Desktop 1.0.

Using UNC Network Names with Existing Software
----------------------------------------------
There are three ways to assign a network resource in Windows 95.

1. Assign a network resource by using its UNC name. UNC names are
  in the format \\server\share. Windows 95 defaults to this method.
2. Assign a local name to the network resource; for example, assign
  one of your LPT ports to a network printer.
3. Assign a drive letter to a remote disk drive. This was the default
  behavior in Windows 3.1 and is still supported in Windows 95.

Using a UNC name removes much of the ambiguity of the older method
that Windows 3.1 used. UNC names tend to be longer than their Windows
3.1 equivalents and this can cause problems for some programs. If you
experience such problems, you can revert to the Windows 3.1 method
of addressing network resources. For more information, look up
"capturing, printer ports" and "mapping, drive letters" in the
Windows Help index.

This may affect the following programs: Design CAD 2D for Windows,
CorelDraw for Windows, Corel Photo Paint 5, ccMail, Quickbooks 3.0,
Lotus Notes, MS Profit 1.0b.

Notes on Specific MS-DOS-Based and Windows-Based Programs
---------------------------------------------------------
Adaptec EZ-SCSI 3.1: When this program is run with Windows 95,
you may experience the following product limitations:

-  Adaptec EZ-SCSI will not modify your Config.sys and/or
  Autoexec.bat files like it does under Windows 3.1. To use
  real-mode device drivers with Windows 95, you will need to run
  EZ-SCSI for DOS. To do this, start Windows 95, and then when you
  see the message "Starting Windows 95", choose Command Prompt Only.
  Your Config.sys and and Autoexec.bat files will be modified
  automatically as needed.
-  The SCSI Power Management device driver included with Adaptec
  EZ-SCSI 3.1 is not compatible with Windows 95.
-  The SCSI tape backup package does not support backing up long
  filenames.

For information about Adaptec software products designed specifically
for Windows 95, please contact Adaptec direct at (800) 959-7274 or
(408) 945-8600.

Adobe Persuasion: You cannot install Adobe Persuasion version 3.0
if your Config.sys file is empty or has not been created. This is not
a problem if you are upgrading over an earlier version of Windows or
MS-DOS.

To create a Config.sys file:
1. Click the Start menu, click Programs, click Accessories, and then
  click Notepad.
2. Type "rem This is a temporary config.sys file."
3. Click File, and then click Save.
4. Type C:\Config.sys, and then press ENTER.
5. Continue to install Adobe Persuasion 3.0.

For questions about Adobe Persuasion, call Adobe Systems, Inc.
Customer Service at (800) 833-6687. Outside the United States, call
(425) 622-5500 or the number that came with your program.

Alacrity E-Quip: If you have Alacrity E-Quip or E-Quip + release
1.33D or earlier, you may experience faxing and/or OCR problems. For
upgrade information, contact Alacrity at: fax (908) 813-2490,
BBS (908) 813-2495.

Ami Pro v3.01: To run the Ami Pro v3.01 tutorial correctly, you must
set your Windows 95 taskbar to Auto-Hide. To do this:
1. Click the Start menu, click Settings, and then click Taskbar.
2. Make sure the Auto hide option is checked.

AST Works: If you have problems with the voicemail program that comes
with AST Works, you will need to obtain updated files. Those files are
available on the Windows driver library, which can be ordered
separately.

Astound 2.x: If you experience printing problems, open the properties
for your printer and turn off EMS spooling.

ATM fonts: ATM fonts will not show up on the font list when certain
printer drivers for fax programs are selected as the default. You will
have this problem with WinFax (all versions), FaxWorks, and older
Quick Link 2 versions. A substitute TrueType font will be used
instead.

AT&amp;T Mail Access PLUS: If you use AT&amp;T Mail Access PLUS for DOS or
AT&amp;T Mail Access Plus for Windows (earlier than version 2.7), you need
to upgrade to the latest release of Access PLUS for Windows in order
to work well on Windows 95. With the latest release, you'll get AT&amp;T's
new mail engine, Mail Transport, which eliminates the need for the
Background Mailer TSR that was in earlier releases. To order an Access
PLUS upgrade or to get more information about other AT&amp;T messaging
products and services, call (800) 242-6005 and ask for Department 95.

Cheyenne ARCSOLO 3.02: Under Windows 95, ARCSOLO 3.02 cannot connect
to the network drives mapped through the Client for NetWare Networks
(Nwredir.vxd)and Client for Microsoft Networks (VREDIR) when the
drives are already mapped. To work around this problem, add the
following line to the [boot] section of your System.ini file:
    network.drv=commctrl.dll

NOTE: Any DLL will work; this is a 16-bit dll.

ClarisWorks for Windows 3.0 v1: To install correctly, you must run the
SETUPCW program on disk 2. The Setup program on disk 1 will not
install the program under Windows 95.

Conner Tape Backup: Because of enhancements to the Windows 95 file
system, which supports long filenames, the Conner tape backup
program does not work with Windows 95. For information about an
updated version of this utility, call Conner Peripherals at Conner
Express, (800) 531-0968; ask for the Conner Backup Executive (CBE).
Or call Conner's FaxBack system at (408) 456-4903.

DragonDictate for Windows: For information about the availability of
an upgrade that may be compatible with Windows 95, call Dragon Systems
at (800) 825-5897 or (617) 965-5200.

Faxworks v3.0: You may experience problems if your default printer
name is extremely long, which could prevent the Call Center dialog box
from appearing. If this happens, shorten the printer name or, if you
are printing to a network printer, capture the printer port. For
instructions on how to capture a printer port, see Windows Help.

FaxWorks version 3.00f.041: The Advanced AGC option (audio gain
control) is designed to adjust incoming call voice volume. This option
does not work with Windows 95. Using this option creates a .tmp file
in your Temp directory which gradually grows to fill the disk and
cause a system lockup.

Finesse: The Finesse program that was written for Windows 3.1 prevents
Windows 95 from correctly displaying taskbar buttons. If you use this
program, buttons representing your running programs will not appear
correctly on the taskbar. To switch between open programs, press
ALT+TAB. If you are in the United States, call your local Toshiba
product support organization for more information. Or you can call
(800) 999-4273. Outside the United States, call the product support
number that came with this program.

Fonts: Only TrueType fonts can be printed with Windows version 1.0
printer drivers. If a version 1.0 printer driver is selected, only
TrueType fonts will be displayed in the font list. WinFax Pro 4.0 is
the only known shipping program with a Windows 1.0 printer driver.

Frye Computer Systems Statistics Display Rack for NetWare (StatRack):
To run this program with Windows 95:
1. Locate a copy of the file Wfwnet.drv dated 7/24/93 or later. This
  file is included with Windows NT version 3.1 or later, or you can
  contact technical support at Frye Computer Systems.
2. Copy the Wfwnet.drv file into the Windows directory on your
  Windows 95 computer.
3. Add the following line to the [boot] section of your System.ini
  file, located in the Windows directory:
    network.drv = wfwnet.drv

4. Create a file called Fryenet.ini consisting of the following two
  lines:
    [network]
    protocol = ipx

5. Copy this file into the Windows directory on the Windows 95
  computer.

Gold Disk Astound v2.0: If you experience problems with embedded OLE
objects, obtain the v2.01 patch from Gold Disk.

IBM Client Access/400: You will need a patch to run this program with
Windows 95. For more information, use the SNDPTFORD command through
Electronic Customer Support (ECS), and then ask for APAR II08704. Or
you can call 1-800-274-0015, and then:
1. Press 1 for support line, then enter your customer number.
2. Press 1 for new call.
3. Press 6 for PTF and ask for APAR II08704.

running this game:
1. Right-click the Malcolm.pif file, click Properties, and then click
  the Memory tab.
2. Change the settings for Expanded Memory and Extended Memory to
  4096.
3. Click Apply, and then change the same settings back to Auto.

Lotus Notes: To install Lotus Notes from a network computer, you need
to map a drive letter to the network computer. To do this, carry out
the following procedure:
1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, and then click Windows
  Explorer.
2. On the Tools menu, click Map Network Drive.
3. In the Path box, type the path to the network server, and then
  click OK.
4. Click the drive you just mapped, and find the Lotus Notes setup
  program.
5. Install Lotus Notes.

Lotus Notes Windows Client 3.2: If you are using the NetBIOS interface
over IPX and the NetBEUI protocol stacks, then it is necessary to
configure the port for NetBIOS using the unit number that properly
corresponds to that protocol. The default number for the first NetBIOS
protocol is first set to 0, then any additional NetBIOS interface will
start at port 7 through 1. It is likely that NetBIOS will use 7 or 6
if NetBEUI is using 0. To make changes, in the Lotus Notes Windows
client, click the Tools menu, click Setup, and then click Ports.

Managing your Money v2.0a for Windows: This program uses the
Calendar.exe, Cardfile.exe, and Clock.exe files that shipped with
Windows 3.x. If you upgrade over Windows 3.x, all of these features
will be usable. If you did not upgrade over Windows 3.x you will not
be able to use the Calendar, Cardfile, or Clock.

MaxSoft-Ocron: Business Card Reader 2.0, ColorFax, ImagePhoto, and
Wordlinx 2.0 were written for Windows 3.1 and may not work correctly
under Windows 95. For more information inside the United States, call

the product support telephone number that came with your copy of
Perceive Personal OCR for Hand Scanners. Or write to the company at
MaxSoft-Ocron, Inc., 4110 Clipper Court, Freemont, CA 94538, USA.

MCS Stereo version 1.05: Because of changes in the Windows 95
operating system, you cannot switch between standard and enhanced
environments in MCS Stereo version 1.05. If you do, the mixer controls
will be disabled. To enable them, close the program, and then reopen
it. If you are in the United States, contact Animotion Development
Corp for information about obtaining a version of this program
designed for Windows 95. Inside the United States: call phone (800)
536-4175 or (205) 591-5715; fax (205) 591-5716; technical support
(205) 591-5715; technical support BBS (205) 591-5795. Outside the
United States, call the product support number that came with your
copy of MCS Stereo.

Media Blitz 3.0:  After installing Media Blitz 3.0, you must restart
your computer before you run the program to enable Windows 95 to pick
up changes made by the setup program.

Menuworks Total Security:  The security features of this product
are incompatible with the Windows 95 file system. It is strongly
recommended that you remove this software before installing Windows
95.

Microprose 1942 Gold: This program uses the version of Command.com
located in your \Dos directory. Older versions of Command.com will
not run with Windows 95. To run 1942 Gold with Windows 95, copy
Command.com in your \Windows directory over the version in your
\Dos directory.
