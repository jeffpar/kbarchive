SYMPTOMS
========

Your NetWare account is locked out when you try to establish a connection to a
Novell server from File Manager using Client Services for NetWare (CSNW) or
Gateway Services for Netware (GSNW).

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the NetWare and Windows NT user accounts have the same
username, but different passwords, and the NetWare account is restricted to
"Lock out after three (or up to six) bad logons."

When you log on, Windows NT tries to establish a connection to the default
preferred server using the Windows NT credentials (Windows NT username and
Windows NT password). When this fails, you are prompted to select a preferred
NetWare server and enter a password. If you enter the correct NetWare password,
the connection is established and you can connect to shares through File Manager
with no problems.

If you choose not to logon to the Novell server by choosing Cancel or by
selecting None for the preferred server, Windows NT still tries to connect to
the Novell server several times using the Windows NT credentials. Each attempt
by Windows NT to establish a connection is counted as a failed logon attempt. If
you later attempt to connect to the NetWare drive from File Manager, the attempt
fails as the account is locked out.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, make sure the Windows NT and NetWare account
passwords match.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
