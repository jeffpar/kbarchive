The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Slide Shows in PowerPoint for Windows 95 version 7.0 is different from Slide
Shows in PowerPoint 4.0 for Windows. The "More Information" section of this
article contains a summary of some of the major differences you may encounter.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. The On-Screen Annotation and Hidden Slide buttons no longer appear in
  PowerPoint for Windows 95 version 7.0. This change was made because many
  thought that the buttons' on screen presence was a distraction from the
  presentation being shown.

2. In PowerPoint 4.0, if you show a hidden slide, proceed to the next slide, and
  then go back to the previous slide, the slide preceding the hidden slide is
  displayed. In PowerPoint for Windows 95 version 7.0 this has been changed so
  that the hidden slide is displayed instead.

3. In PowerPoint 4.0, you were limited to placing builds on body text only. In
  PowerPoint for Windows 95 version 7.0, animation effects can be placed on any
  object or objects, including text, text objects, OLE objects, and sounds. If
  you choose to make more than one object build per slide, you can actually
  choose the order in which they are built.

4. In PowerPoint for Windows 95 version 7.0, you can utilize the new Interactive
  Setting dialog box, which replaces the Play Settings dialog in PowerPoint
  4.0. You can set options including when the object is to become active, and
  whether it should hide itself or not.

5. In a PowerPoint 4.0 or PowerPoint for Windows 95 slide show you can use the N
  key, followed by a number, to branch to a specific slide. If you branch from
  a slide with animation effects, and then return to the original slide, the
  animation effects play a second time. In PowerPoint for Windows 95, you have
  the choice to use the Slide Navigator to jump to certain slides and back
  again without the builds playing over again.
