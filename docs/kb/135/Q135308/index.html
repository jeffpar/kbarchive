-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows NT 3.51 and start Disk Administrator for the first
time, Windows NT will write a disk signature to the drives before opening the
Disk Administrator window.

The first time Disk Administrator is opened, drives and partitions appear
correctly, but if you close and reopen it, some of the partitions are lost and
incorrect information is displayed on the others. Alternatively, Disk
Administrator can hang during initialization or the error message, "The
parameter is incorrect" appears.

This only happens if there are more than two logical drives in an extended
partition when Disk Administrator attempts to write a fault tolerance
signature.

This problem will not occur if a signature is already present.

Another symptom of this problem is that any partition formatted as Windows NT
File System (NTFS) will show 0 bytes available and 0 bytes free after the
signature was written by WINDISK, but before the first reboot after the
signature was written.


CAUSE
=====

Windows NT Disk Administrator writes a fault tolerance signature to each
physical drive's master boot record, if one is not already present, when it is
run for the first time. Faulty calculations result in the corruption of logical
drives in an existing extended partition.

NOTE: It is possible for a system to remain functional after the partition table
is corrupted. The nature of the corruption is such that partition table data is
written to incorrect locations on the disk which may lie in the middle of user
or file system data. Provided this information is not overwritten, the partition
table entries may still identify the layout of the drives sufficiently well that
Windows NT can continue to access the drives. However, this is an unstable
situation and access to the partitions will be lost when the table entries are
eventually overwritten.

If the table entries overwrite existing data, user data or file system integrity
are compromised immediately.

If you suspect that your partition table is compromised, immediately back up
critical data, then re-partition your disk and restore the backed up data to the
system.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

- Install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.51.

  -or-

- If your system has already been corrupted, but Windows NT still boots, obtain
  the file CORRECT.EXE to correct the partition table whenever possible.

  CORRECT.EXE does not guarantee recovery of user data, it just means that the
  partition table is put back in its original state if possible, or at least a
  consistent state if there is not enough information to put it back in its
  original state. In the mean time, critical user or file system data may still
  have been irretrievably lost.

  This program is also being distributed with the hotfix and both the fixed
  kernel and CORRECT.EXE are being posted to our external FTP server as well.
  Again, this is an unusual step that we are taking due to the seriousness of
  the problem.

  For more information read the README.TXT file posted with CORRECT.EXE.

To Prevent Partition Table Corruption
-------------------------------------

If Disk Administrator has not been run, you can prevent partition table
corruption by any of these 3 procedures:

- If there are not already more than two logical drives in an extended
  partition, simply use Disk Administrator normally. The signature will be
  written correctly and no corruption should ensue. If there are more than two
  logical drives, perform a full system backup of data on all drives prior to
  running Disk Administrator. Then be prepared to delete and recreate the
  partition structure prior to restoring the previously backed up data.

- If an earlier version of Windows NT is available, boot that version and run
  its Disk Administrator so that a fault tolerance signature is written to the
  disk. The 3.5 version of WINDISK.EXE may be run directly on Windows NT
  version 3.51 in order to write the initial fault tolerance signature, but is
  not recommended for systems using third-party partitioning software to
  support large IDE drives.

- If you have the tools and knowledge to edit the disk at the sector level, you
  may manually enter a disk signature so that Disk Administrator will not try
  to do so. The 4-byte signature is located at offset 0x1b8 from the start of
  the Master Boot Record (physical sector 0). The value written is not
  important provided that it is non-zero, but if there are multiple disks in
  the system, each should have a distinct signature value. If this field is
  already non-zero, it is not necessary to change it.

CAUTION: Use this option at your own risk. Incorrectly editing physical disk
sectors can result in corruption of the entire physical volume, resulting in
loss of data and may require a complete reinstallation of the operating system.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
