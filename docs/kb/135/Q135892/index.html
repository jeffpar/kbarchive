WHAT IS MICROSOFT EXCHANGE?
===========================

Microsoft Exchange enables you to send and receive e-mail, faxes,
and documents in messages. Information services that can be used
with Windows 95 include Microsoft Mail, Microsoft Fax, and the
Microsoft Network. Also, a Microsoft Mail postoffice is included
in this version of Windows 95.

MINIMUM HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS
=============================

Microsoft Exchange runs on a minimum of 6 megabytes (MB) of RAM,
and 10 MB of hard disk space (for the swapfile). However, it is
recommended that you have at least 8 MB of RAM for good
performance.

INSTALLATION
============

To install Microsoft Exchange during Windows 95 Setup, choose the
information services that you would like to use with Microsoft
Exchange.

You can also install Microsoft Exchange after you have completed
installation of Windows 95 by double-clicking the Inbox icon
on your desktop and then choosing the information services that
you would like to use with Microsoft Exchange.

If you have removed the Inbox from the desktop, you can install
Microsoft Exchange by using Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel.
You must shut down and restart Windows 95 after doing this.

When you install Windows 95 or use Microsoft Exchange for the
first time, the Microsoft Exchange Setup Wizard will be run. The
Wizard is also run each time you add a new profile using the Mail
And Fax icon in Control Panel.

USING MICROSOFT EXCHANGE WITH MICROSOFT SCHEDULE+ 1.0
=====================================================

Microsoft Exchange is designed to work with Microsoft Schedule+
7.0. When Microsoft Exchange is installed, it will partially
disable Microsoft Schedule+ 1.0. You will still be able to use
Microsoft Schedule+ 1.0 in standalone mode, but you will not be
able to send or receive meeting requests. You will see an error
message when starting Microsoft Schedule+ 1.0 that notifies you
that the mail spooler cannot be started. Click Yes to continue,
and Microsoft Schedule+ 1.0 will continue.

Microsoft Schedule+ is disabled by changing Mailspl.exe to
Mailspl.bak and by putting a StartupOffline=1 line into
Schdplus.ini.

NOTE:  There is no message warning you that these changes are
made.

USING MICROSOFT EXCHANGE WITH MICROSOFT MAIL
============================================

Microsoft Exchange is designed to replace the Microsoft Mail
program that comes with Windows for Workgroups and Microsoft
Mail version 3.x. After installing Microsoft Exchange you will
no longer be able to run the older Microsoft Mail program,
but you will be able to use Microsoft Exchange to send and
receive messages.

USING MICROSOFT EXCHANGE WITH THE COMPUSERVE SERVICE(SM)
========================================================

The setup program for the CompuServe Service(sm) for
Microsoft Exchange is available on the Windows 95 CD in
the \Drivers\Other\Exchange\Compusrv directory.  The files will
also be available on CompuServe in the "cissoft" forum.
For more information, see the Cisnotes.rtf file in the
\Drivers\Other\Exchange\Compusrv directory of the Windows 95 CD.

UPGRADING A PREVIOUS INSTALLATION OF WINDOWS 95
===============================================

You can install Microsoft Exchange with Windows 95 over an
existing Windows 95 setup. When you upgrade, you may lose some
of your Microsoft Exchange preferences.

There is NO interoperability between the final release and the
beta releases. You cannot send or receive messages to or from
mismatched Windows 95 releases. Upgrade all Microsoft Exchange
users simultaneously to the released version of Microsoft
Exchange.

TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS
====================

If you experience problems connecting to your Microsoft Mail
postoffice, please ensure you have network access to your postoffice.
You can also get diagnostic details about the reason for failures by
clicking the Tools menu, clicking Microsoft Mail Tools, and then
clicking View Session Log.

If you experience a problem composing or reading a message that
produces an error saying "Can't launch form," then the forms file
may be corrupt. To correct this problem, quit Microsoft Exchange,
and then go to your {Windows}\Forms directory and delete Frmcache.dat.
&gt;From {Windows}\Forms, copy the file Frmcache.bak to Frmcache.dat,
and restart Microsoft Exchange.

Some Microsoft Mail 3.x extensions are not compatible with
Microsoft Exchange--for example, WinRules and Conference+.
Microsoft Exchange automatically disables some of these
extensions to prevent system problems. If a Microsoft Mail 3.x
extension is causing a problem, it can be disabled by placing a
';' in front of the corresponding line in Msmail.ini.  Contact
the product vendors for further information.

If you experience a problem where messages are stuck in the Outbox,
it is possible that the wrong information service is trying to process
the message. To correct the problem, click the Tools menu, click
Options, click Delivery, and then ensure the information services are
listed in the order you want them.

After quitting Microsoft Exchange, you may notice that mapisp32 is
still running. Mapisp32 continues to run for 20 seconds after you
quit Microsoft Exchange.

E-forms created with the Microsoft Electronic Forms Designer do not
open correctly when saved in the .msg file format. Transfer the .msg
file from the file system to the Inbox to open the e-form correctly.

If clicking Send on the File command in Lotus Approach does not
work, please ensure that you have a file called Msmail.ini in your
{Windows}\ directory.  If the file does not exist, just create an
empty file with that name.

Two clients using Microsoft Mail should not be run against the same
Microsoft Mail mailbox. This configuration is not supported.
