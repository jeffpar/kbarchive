Product(s): Microsoft Mail For PC Networks

Last Modified: 20-MAY-2002

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the External Mail program (any version) over a wide area network
(WAN) using an integrated service digital (ISDN) line, the following error may
occur in the SESSION.LOG when you use the DrivesDynamic and DrivesWAN options
together in the EXTERNAL.INI file:

  Network name not found: Drive in error: &lt;drive letter&gt;

CAUSE
=====

If the postoffices are using routers to establish the connection, they may not
be able to connect fast enough when the External Mail program tries to
dynamically connect to a WAN postoffice. In this case, External thinks the
postoffice no longer exists and marks the postoffice as being in error, even if
mail is waiting to be sent to it. The External Mail program will wait a minimum
of whatever the IntervalUpdate option is set to, the default is five minutes,
before trying to resend mail to that postoffice.

The Mail External program will wait a minimum period equal to the IntervalUpdate
value (default=5 minutes) before you try to resend mail to that postoffice.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem.

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information on support costs, please go to the following address on the World
Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  File Name      Version
  ----------------------
  External.exe   3.5.23

This hotfix has been posted to the following Internet location as Exty2k.exe:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/mail/pcmail-public/All-Y2K/


WORKAROUND
==========

Either remove the DrivesDynamic option from the EXTERNAL.INI file, or lower the
IntervalUpdate option so the External Mail program will not wait so long to
recheck the postoffice before delivering mail.

IntervalUpdate must be set to a value greater than zero in order for the second
attempt to send mail to occur.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the DrivesWAN option in effect, checking for updates is the only
opportunity the External Mail program has to re-establish the connection.
Network traffic should be negligible, because it only checks FLAG.GLB to see if
it has been updated.

For additional information about the DrivesDynamic and DrivesWAN options, please
see Chapter 12 of the "Administrator's Guide" for version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
for PC Networks.
