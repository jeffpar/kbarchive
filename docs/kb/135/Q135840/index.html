SUMMARY
=======

This sample Visual Basic (VB) code illustrates the use of the ODBC API call
SQLBindParameter() with a VB string variable. It has been kept as simple as
possible with a minimal amount of code and declarations.

For more information on calling Windows APIs from Visual Basic, refer to the
document "Ten Commandments for Accessing the Windows API" written by Daniel
Appleman of Desaware and available on the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN)
Level 1 CD.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Declarations required to call ODBC API from VB 3.0:

     Declare Function GetFocus Lib "User" () As Integer
     Declare Function GetParent Lib "User" (ByVal hWnd%) As Integer
     Declare Function SQLAllocConnect Lib "odbc.dll" (ByVal henv&amp;, phdbc&amp;)
     As Integer
     Declare Function SQLAllocEnv Lib "odbc.dll" (phenv&amp;) As Integer
     Declare Function SQLAllocStmt Lib "odbc.dll" (ByVal hdbc&amp;, phstmt&amp;) As
     Integer
     Declare Function SQLDisconnect Lib "odbc.dll" (ByVal hdbc&amp;) As Integer
     Declare Function SQLError Lib "odbc.dll" (ByVal henv&amp;, ByVal hdbc&amp;,
     ByVal hstmt&amp;, ByVal szSqlState$, pfNativeError&amp;, ByVal szErrorMsg$,
     ByVal cbErrorMsgMax%, pcbErrorMsg%) As Integer
     Declare Function SQLExecDirect Lib "odbc.dll" (ByVal hstmt&amp;, ByVal
     szSqlStr$, ByVal cbSqlStr&amp;) As Integer
     Declare Function SQLFetch Lib "odbc.dll" (ByVal hstmt&amp;) As Integer
     Declare Function SQLFreeConnect Lib "odbc.dll" (ByVal hdbc&amp;) As Integer
     Declare Function SQLFreeEnv Lib "odbc.dll" (ByVal henv&amp;) As Integer
     Declare Function SQLFreeStmt Lib "odbc.dll" (ByVal hstmt&amp;, ByVal
     fOption%) As Integer

You should pay particular attention to the declaration of any string variable
that will need to be passed to ODBC.DLL. This includes rgbValue in both
SQLBindParameter() and SQLGetData(). The declaration should be "rgbValue as Any"
to work. This is the most flexible way to declare a function variable for a
Windows DLL function that will be passed from a VB program in a Windows DLL
because it allows for both string and numeric values to be passed. When a string
value is passed from a VB program to the Windows DLL and the DLL call expects a
'char *', then the VB program should declare the variable being passed as a VB
String variable, and then pass it with the ByVal indicator. This is what is
shown in the example here. If the VB variable to be passed had been a numeric
value, then the variable that would be passed could be declared as long or
integer, and during the call to the DLL, the variable would go into the call
without the ByVal modifier.

The reason this happens is that in all cases, the C function expects a pointer to
a memory location. From VB's perspective, a String variable refers to a pointer
to a pointer to a memory location containing a string. This is why ByVal used in
front of the variable during the function call gives a pointer to a memory
location containing a string. On the other hand, a numeric variable in VB refers
to a pointer to a memory location containing a numeric value. That is why the
ByVal modifier is not necessary for the function call when a numeric VB variable
is being passed in.

     Declare Function SQLGetData Lib "odbc.dll" (ByVal hstmt&amp;, ByVal
     icol%, ByVal fCType%, rgbValue As Any, ByVal cbValueMax&amp;, pcbValue As
     Long) As Integer
     Declare Function SQLBindParameter Lib "odbc.dll" (ByVal hstmt&amp;, ByVal
     ipar%, ByVal fParamType%, ByVal fCType%, ByVal fSqlType%, ByVal
     cbColDef&amp;, ByVal ibScale%, rgbValue As Any, ByVal cbValueMax&amp;,
     pcbValue As Long) As Integer

     Declare Function SQLDriverConnect Lib "odbc.dll" (ByVal hdbc&amp;, ByVal
     hWnd%, ByVal szCSIn$, ByVal cbCSIn%, ByVal szCSOut$, ByVal cbCSMax%,
     cbCSOut%, ByVal fDrvrComp%) As Integer
     Declare Function SQLParamData Lib "odbc.dll" (ByVal hstmt&amp;, prgbValue
     As Any) As Integer
     Declare Function SQLPutData Lib "odbc.dll" (ByVal hstmt&amp;, rgbValue As
     Any, ByVal cbValue&amp;) As Integer

     Const SQL_ERROR = -1
     Const SQL_C_DEFAULT = 99

     Const SQL_CHAR = 1
     Const SQL_C_CHAR = 1

     Const SQL_NEED_DATA = 99

     Const SQL_LONGVARCHAR = -1
     Const SQL_BINARY = -2
     Const SQL_VARBINARY = -3
     Const SQL_LONGVARBINARY = -4

     Const SQL_C_BINARY = SQL_BINARY

     Const SQL_DRIVER_PROMPT = 2

     Const SQL_LEN_DATA_AT_EXEC_OFFSET = -100

     Sub Command3D1_Click()

This sample VB code illustrates the use of the ODBC API call SQLBindParameter().
It has been kept as simple as possible with a minimal amount of code and
declarations.

      Dim henv As Long
      Dim hdbc As Long
      Dim hstmt As Long
      Dim nstatus%
      Dim buffer As String
      Dim param As String

      nstatus = SQLAllocEnv(henv)

      nstatus = SQLAllocConnect(henv, hdbc)
      If (nstatus = SQL_ERROR) Then
          MsgBox "Couldn't allocate memory for connection"
      End If

The parameters passed to SQLDriverConnect() after the second one are not really
used for anything. The call expects the variables as output variables so we pass
them to the call to problems.

     nstatus = SQLDriverConnect(hdbc, GetParent(GetFocus()), S$,
     Len(S$), Server, Len(Server), cbOut%, SQL_DRIVER_PROMPT)
      If (nstatus = SQL_ERROR) Then
          MsgBox "Couldn't connect"
      End If

In this sample, you are connecting to a SQL Server database and define this
table:

  CREATE TABLE model01 (col1 char(30),col2 char(30))

after you have executed the following insert statement:

  INSERT INTO model01 VALUES ("Kate Moss","Elite")

For simplicity, assume only one row in the table.

      sSQLString = "Select * from model01 where col2 = ?"

      leng = Len(sSQLString)

      nstatus = SQLAllocStmt(hdbc, hstmt)
      If (nstatus = SQL_ERROR) Then
          MsgBox "Couldn't allocate memory for statement"
      End If

At this point, assign a value to the variable "param" that is going to be bound
to the SQL statement via SQLBindParameter(). After this binding, the SQL
statement becomes:

  select * from model01 where col2 = 'Elite'

It is not a requirement of the VB programmer to put the single quotation marks
into the parameter marker (param). This is handled by ODBC.

  param = "Elite"

In this particular call to SQLBindParameter, you are binding a VB string variable
to a column on the SQL Server database server that is a char(30). The '1' in the
third parameter of this call indicates that this parameter is of type
SQL_PARAM_INPUT. For more information, refer to the definition of fParamType in
the description of SQLBindParameter() in the "Microsoft ODBC 2.0 Programmer's
Reference and SDK Guide."

The sixth parameter, cbColDef, is indicating that you will be binding to a column
that is 30 bytes long on SQL Server. This could also be determined with
SQLColumns() but is assumed here to keep this example small and simple.

The 7th parameter (ibScale) is zero because Appendix D of the ODBC 2.0
Programmer's Reference states that this is the case for char datatypes. The 8th
parameter is a pointer to the VB SQLGetData() and the VB variable "param". Note
that the ByVal in the passing of the VB variable called buffer is very important
for this call to succeed. The 9th parameter is 300 because you should not return
more than 300 bytes through this parameter. And the final parameter indicates
that the parameter is a null-terminated string (SQL_NTS as defined in
C:\ODBCSDK\INCLUDE\SQL.H).

  nstatus = SQLBindParameter(hstmt, 1, 1, SQL_C_CHAR, SQL_CHAR, 30,
     0, ByVal param, 300, -3)
      If (nstatus = SQL_ERROR) Then
          MsgBox "error on Bind"
      End If

Send the SQL statement, which is now in the form:

     select * from model01 where col2 = 'Elite'

      nstatus = SQLExecDirect(hstmt, sSQLString, leng)
      If (nstatus = SQL_ERROR) Then
          MsgBox "Error on execdirect"
      End If

Fetch back the first row of data. To keep this example simple, assume that this
is the only row of data in the table that is of concern and fetch that.
Normally, you should keep calling SQLFetch() and SQLGetData() in a loop until
SQLFetch() returns 100 as a return code(SQL_NO_DATA_FOUND as defined in SQL.H).

      nstatus = SQLFetch(hstmt)
      If (nstatus = SQL_ERROR) Then
          MsgBox "Error on fetch"
      End If

It is important to initialize the VB variable that is being passed into
SQLGetData() to return the data that was just fetched back. Otherwise, it may
not be returned correctly or at all.

  buffer = String$(300, 0)

Bring the data returned to the client workstation via SQLFetch() into the VB
program via SQLGetData() and the VB variable "buffer". Note that the ByVal in
the passing of the VB variable called buffer is very important for this call to
succeed.

     nstatus = SQLGetData(hstmt, 1, SQL_C_CHAR, ByVal buffer, Len(buffer),
     300
     )
      If (nstatus = SQL_ERROR) Then
          MsgBox "Error on getdata"
      End If

Print the data just fetched back onto the screen.

       MsgBox "buffer contains =&gt; " + buffer

Here, do a quick cleanup of the environment. Notice that you do not need to call
SQLFreeStmt():

      nstatus = SQLDisconnect(hdbc)
      nstatus = SQLFreeConnect(hdbc)
      nstatus = SQLFreeEnv(henv)

      MsgBox "Finished"
     End Sub
