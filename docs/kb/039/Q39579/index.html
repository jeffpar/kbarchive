If you need an earlier version of Microsoft QuickBASIC because the
latest version does not help you and a previous version is known to
solve the problem(s), you can obtain one by calling Microsoft Customer
Service at (206) 882-8088 between 6 AM and 5:30 PM Pacific time.

Microsoft normally only sells the most current version of QuickBASIC,
but Microsoft Customer Service may have earlier versions available. As
of December 1988, the following QuickBASIC versions are available from
the Microsoft Customer Service Department:

   Version 2.01
   Version 3.00
   Version 4.00
   Version 4.00b
   Version 4.50

You may be asked to return your current version for a "down grade," or
if you can't return your current version, you may have to purchase the
earlier version.

Please confirm availability, charges, and conditions by calling the
Microsoft Customer Service Department.

You can also check your local dealer or software discount companies to
see if they have any earlier versions.
