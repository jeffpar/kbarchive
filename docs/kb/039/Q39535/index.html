The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 2.11, 3.1, 3.2, 3.21, 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22

SUMMARY
=======

You may notice a performance slowdown for MS-DOS when creating many files in a
subdirectory. MS-DOS is much slower at accessing a subdirectory that contains
many files or deleted files than at accessing a new subdirectory (that is, a
subdirectory containing no deleted files).

This slowdown occurs because MS-DOS directories do not get smaller when you
delete a file. MS-DOS inserts a "no file here" mark for each deleted file in a
directory. There are two different "No file here" marks in the first bytes of
directories:

  Value   Description
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  E5H     No file at this location
  05H     No file at this location
  00H     No file at this location and no files after this location

Whenever you create a file, MS-DOS searches to the end of the directory to see if
a file with that name already exists. Even if files have been deleted from the
directory, MS-DOS must still check for the "No file here" entry for each deleted
file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is an example that demonstrates the reason for the performance
slowdown:

1. Create a directory DIR. Initially, this new directory looks like the
  following:

     .
     ..
     00H

2. Create the file FILE1. MS-DOS has to look at two entries to determine that
  there is no file by that name. The directory now looks like the following:

     .
     ..
     FILE1
     00H

3. Create the file FILE2. MS-DOS now has to look at three entries to determine
  that there is no file by that name. The directory now looks like the
  following:

     .
     ..
     FILE1
     FILE2
     00H

4. Create the file FILE3. MS-DOS now has to look at four entries to determine
  that there is no file by that name. The directory now looks like the
  following:

     .
     ..
     FILE1
     FILE2
     FILE3
     00H

5. Delete FILE*. The directory now looks like the following:

     .
     ..
     E5
     E5
     E5
     00H

6. Create the file FILE1. MS-DOS still has to look at four entries to determine
  that there is no file by that name. (Note that MS-DOS must look at the empty
  entries thus performance does not improve after the deletion.) The directory
  now looks like the following:

     .
     ..
     FILE1
     E5H
     E5H
     00H

7. Create the file FILE2. Again, MS-DOS has to look at four entries to determine
  that there is no file by that name. The directory now looks like the
  following:

     .
     ..
     FILE1
     FILE2
     E5H
     00H

8. Create the file FILE3. MS-DOS has to look at four entries to determine that
  there is no file by that name. The directory now looks like the following:

     .
     ..
     FILE1
     FILE2
     FILE3
     00H

The performance decreases more when deleted entries exist in a subdirectory;
performance can be even slower, depending on the size and type of the disk and
the size of the MS-DOS buffer cache (the BUFFERS command in the file
CONFIG.SYS). Disk access is very expensive in terms of performance, and
depending on the interaction with the MS-DOS buffer cache LRU (Least Recently
Used) management, you may have to do more disk accesses.

There are third-party utilities that edit directories and eliminate unused
directory entries, improving the performance of MS-DOS.
