SUMMARY
=======

The data control block (DCB) structure defines the control setting for a serial
communications device. OpenComm() and BuildCommDCB() both initialize a DCB
structure. However, there are many fields in the DCB that cannot be changed
using these procedures. These fields can be updated directly, and these changes
can be applied to the communications port using SetCommState().

MORE INFORMATION
================

OpenComm() uses BuildCommDCB() with "COM1:9600, E, 7, 1" as the lpszDef
parameter to build a default DCB. OpenComm() internally calls SetCommState()
with this default DCB to set the initial state of the communications port.

BuildCommDCB() can be used to initialize a DCB with certain settings. This
procedure takes a string in the same format as the MS-DOS mode command for its
lpszDef parameter. For example, BuildCommDCB("COM1:9600, n, 8, 1", &amp;myDCB)
sets myDCB to have a baud rate of 9600, no parity, 8-bit byte size, and 1 stop
bit. This string needs to contain only the COM port and baud rate; if the other
values are absent, they will default. The default settings are even parity, byte
size of 7, and 1 stop bit. SetCommState() must be called to put the new DCB
settings into effect.

SetCommState() takes a DCB as a parameter, and sets the port according to all the
parameters. A DCB can be initialized by calling BuildCommDCB() or the current
settings can be returned by calling GetCommState(). In addition, the fields in
the DCB can be modified directly. After a DCB is changed, SetCommState() must be
used to apply the setting to the port.

Below is a summary of all the DCB fields. Each field has a description of what
happens in BuildCommDCB(). The information that follows SetCommState() indicates
how the DCB can be manipulated manually. That DCB can then be used in the lpDCB
parameter to SetCommState().

Id - The ID of the port. This is set by BuildCommDCB(), and is the
    same as the OpenComm() return value.

BaudRate - BuildCommDCB() - The baud rate is based on the first two
    characters in the baud rate position in the MS-DOS mode string. For
    example, "COM1:96,n,8,1" will set the baud rate to 9600. The only
    baud rates that can be set are 110, 150, 300, 600,1200, 2400,
    4800, 9600, and 19200. If none of these baud rates are used,
    BuildCommDCB() returns an error.

    SetCommState() - The BaudRate field can set any baud rate up to 57,600
    by either setting the BaudRate field in the DCB to one of the
    CBR_baudrate constants, or to any number greater than 2 and less
    than CBR_110. Numbers outside this range result in SetCommState()
    returning an IE_BAUDRATE error.

ByteSize - BuildCommDCB() - Specifying any number other than 7 or 8
    results in an error.

    SetCommState() - The byteSize field can be set to any number between
    4 and 8. Numbers outside this range result in SetCommState()
    returning an IE_BYTESIZE error.

Parity - BuildCommDCB - The parity can be set to "E" (even), "O"
    (odd), "N" (none), "M" (mark) or "S" (space).

    SetCommState() - The Parity field in the DCB can be set to NOPARITY,
    ODDPARITY, EVENPARITY, MARKPARITY, or SPACEPARITY. Other settings
    result in SetCommState() returning and IE_DEFAULT error.

StopBits - BuildCommDCB - Stop bits of 1 or 2 are accepted. Any other
    value (including 1.5) returns an error.

    SetCommDCB() - The StopBits field can be set to ONESTOPBIT,
    ONE5STOPBITS, or TWOSTOPBITS. Other settings result in
    SetCommState() returning an IE_DEFAULT error.

The time-out field, RlsTimeout, CtsTimeout, or DsrTimeout, enables time-out
checking if its value is anything other than zero. This time-out checking occurs
during WriteComm() regardless of any other values in the DCB, including
fOutxCtsFlow and fOutxDsrFlow. Specifying INFINITE does not really enable
infinite time-out. The value is set to -1 (which is 65536), which makes the
time-out approximately 65 seconds. If a time-out occurs, WriteComm() returns 0
(zero), and GetCommError() returns a time-out error (CE_CTSTO, CE_DSRTO, or
CE_RLSDTO).

RlsTimeout - BuildCommDCB() - If the 6th parameter of the MS-DOS mode
    string is specified as P, then this time-out is infinite (set to
    -1). Any other value returns an error. If it is not specified, it
    defaults to (zero).

    SetCommDCB() - RlsTimeout can be set to IGNORE, INFINITE, or any
    number.

    This field is the amount of time, in milliseconds, to wait for
    RLSD (same as Carrier Detect) to become high, before copying any
    data to the transmit queue during WriteComm().

CtsTimeout - BuildCommDCB() - MS-DOS mode string translated exactly like
    RlsTimeout.

   SetCommDCB() - CtsTimeout can be set to IGNORE, INFINITE, or any
   number.

   This field is the amount of time, in milliseconds, to wait for
   CTS (Clear to Send) to become high before copying any data to the
   transmit queue during WriteComm().

DsrTimeout - BuildCommDCB() - MS-DOS mode string translated exactly like
   RlsTimeout.

   SetCommDCB() - DsrTimeout can be set to IGNORE, INFINITE, or any
   number.

   This field is the amount of time, in milliseconds, to wait for DSR
   (Data Set Ready) to become high before copying any data to the
   transmit queue during WriteComm().

   All of the following flags are set to 0 in BuildCommDCB(), except
   for fBinary, which is set to 1. Any of these can be set to 0 or 1
   before calling SetCommState().

   fBinary - If fBinary is set to zero, reception of the EofChar
       character indicates the end of the input stream. ReadComm()
       will not return any characters past EofChar. If any characters
       are received after EofChar, it will be treated as overflowing
       the receive queue (CE_RXOVER). The reception of EofChar is
       indicated in the COMSTAT status flag CSTF_EOF. If fBinary is
       set to one, the EofChar character has no special meaning.

   fRtsDisable - RTS flow control is used ONLY if fRtsDisable is set
       to 0, and fRtsFlow is set to one. Any other combination will
       disable RTS flow control.

       OpenComm() will set RTS high, and it will remain high unless
       RTS flow control is enabled or fRtsDisable is set.

          fRtsDisable        fRtsFlow         RTS state
          ---------------------------------------------

             0               0                 Set High
             0               1           RTS flow control enabled
             1               0                 Set low
             1               1                 Set low

       CloseComm() does not change the state of RTS or DTR,
       regardless of the state of the disable settings, but it drops
       them momentarily while closing the port.

       If RTS or DTR are not being used for flow control, they can be
       manipulated using EscapeCommFuntion().

   fDtrDisable - Used with fDtrFlow. Functions similar to
       fRtsDisable/fRtsFlow.

   fRtsflow - See fRtsDisable.

   fDtrflow - See fDtrDisable and fRtsDisable.

   fParity - Specifies whether parity checking is enabled. If this
       flag is set, parity checking is performed, and CE_RXPARITY
       errors are reported.

       ReadComm() will return a negative value if it encounters an
       error (such as a parity error). GetCommError()is used to
       retrieve and clear that error. To receive notification of a
       parity error, SetCommEventMask() can be used to enable EV_ERR
       events. GetCommEventMask() should be used to clear the event,
       however, GetCommError() must still be used to clear the error.

   fOutxCtsFlow - Specifies that CTS signal is to be monitored for
       output flow control. If this flag is set and CTS is turned
       off, output is suspended until CTS is again set.

       If the CtsTimeout field contains any value other than zero,
       WriteComm() will wait for CTS, regardless of the value of
       fOutxCtsFlow.

   fOutxDsrFlow - Specifies that DSR signal is to be monitored for
       output flow control. If this flag is set and DSR is turned
       off, output is suspended until DSR is again set.

       If the DsrTimeout field contains any value other than zero,
       WriteComm() will wait for DSR, regardless of the value of
       fOutxDsrFlow.

   fDummy - Reserved.

   fOutX - Specifies that X-on/X-off flow control is used during
       transmission. If this flag is set, transmission stops when the
       XoffChar is received and starts again when the XonChar is
       received.

       If transmission is waiting as a result of the X-off character
       being received, the CSTF_XOFFHOLD flag in the COMSTAT
       structure will be set.

   fInX - Specifies that X-on/X-off flow control is used during
       reception. If this flag is set, the XoffChar character is sent
       when the reception queue comes within XoffLim characters of
       being full and the XonChar character is sent when the
       reception queue comes within XonLim characters of being empty.

       If transmission is waiting as a result of the X-off character
       being transmitted, the CSTF_XOFFSENT flag is set in the
       COMSTAT structure.

   fPeChar - Specifies that characters received with parity errors
       are to be replaced with the character specified by PeChar.

   fNull - Specifies that received null character are to be
       discarded.

   fChEvt - Not actually used.

   fDummy2 - Reserved.

XonChar - BuildCommDCB() - Set to 0x11 (CTRL+Q) SetCommState() - Can
   be set to any character.

   This field is the X-on character for both transmit and receive.
   See fInX and fOutX.

XoffChar - BuildCommDCB() - Set to 0x13 (CTRL+S) SetCommState() - Can
   be set to any character.

   This field is the X-off character for both transmit and receive.
   See fInX and fOutX.

XonLim - BuildCommSCB() - Set to 10. SetCommState() - Can be set to
   any value.

   When the number of characters in the receive queue drops below
   this value, the X-on character is sent, if enabled, and DTR is
   set, if enabled. See fInX and fOutX.

XoffLim - BuildCommDCB() - Set to 10. SetCommState() - can be set to
   any value.

   When the number of characters in the receive queue exceeds this
   value, the X-off character is sent, if enabled, and DTR is
   dropped, if enabled. See fInX and fOutX.

PeChar - BuildCommDCB() - Set to 0. SetCommState() - Can be set to any
   character.

   Parity error replacement character. See fPeChar and fParity.

EofChar - BuildCommDCB() - Set to 0. SetCommState() - Can be set to
   any character.

   Character which specifies end of input. See fBinary.

EvtChar - BuildCommDCB() - Set to 0. SetCommState() - Can be set to
   any character.

   Specifies the value of the character to be used to signal an
   event. When this value is received, an EV_RXFLAG event will be
   generated. The fChEvt flag is not actually used. Use
   SetCommEventMask() to enable these events.

TxDelay - Not actually used.
