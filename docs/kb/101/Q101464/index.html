The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Bookshelf for Windows 1991 edition 
- the operating system: Microsoft Windows 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When installing Bookshelf into Windows version 3.1, you may receive the
following error message when Setup is completed:

  Fatal Error CloseFontProgress:
  Error writing to the system setup file:
  &lt;drive:&gt;\&lt;windowsdir&gt;\SYSTEM\SETUP.INF

where &lt;drive:&gt; is your hard drive and &lt;windowsdir&gt; is your WINDOWS
directory.

CAUSE
=====

Bookshelf 1991 Setup fails because the SETUP.INF file is too large and the
[Fonts] section is not being successfully loaded into the 64kb buffer that
Windows 3.x provides.

WORKAROUND
==========

The following are workarounds to complete the installation of Bookshelf.

Workaround 1
------------

Edit the SETUP.INF file:

1. Make a backup of the SETUP.INF file.

2. Open SETUP.INF in a Word Processor (such as Write, it will be too large for
  Notepad). You can use almost any editor as long as you ensure no formatting
  is saved with the file. The SETUP.INF file is too large to open in the
  Notepad program.

3. Search for the [Fonts] section of the SETUP.INF file.

4. Select the entire [Fonts] section including the heading "[Fonts]".

5. Cut the selected section.

6. Paste the information to the top of the file below the [RUN] section.

7. Save the changes and rerun Bookshelf Setup.

Workaround 2
------------

Reduce the size of the SETUP.INF file.

1. Make a backup of the SETUP.INF file.

2. Open the SETUP.INF file in a text editor (such as Notepad). You may use any
  editor as long as you ensure no formatting is saved with the file.

3. Remove only the comment entries (that is, lines preceded by a semicolon [;])

4. Save the file and rerun Bookshelf Setup.

Workaround 3
------------

Use a manual installation of Bookshelf to complete the setup.

When Setup encounters the error, Bookshelf has been completely setup. The only
thing remaining to do is create the Bookshelf Program Group and insert the
Bookshelf icons. This information is described in the Bookshelf manual
installation instructions. For additional information about manually setting up
Bookshelf, query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base using
the CDG database:

  manual setup Bookshelf
