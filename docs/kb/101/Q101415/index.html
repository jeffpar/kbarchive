SUMMARY
=======

WM_COMMNOTIFY messages with CN_RECEIVE notifications are enabled when
EnableCommNotification() is called with any number but -1 in the cbWriteNotify
parameter. CN_TRANSMIT notifications are enabled when the cbOutQueue parameter
is any number but -1. The CN_RECEIVE notifications are generated when either the
number of characters in the receive queue exceeds cbWriteNotify, or a time-out
occurs. Similarly, CN_TRANSMIT notifications are generated when the number of
characters in the output queue drops below the cbOutQueue parameter.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the COMM.DRV is loaded, it calls CreateSystemTimer() to create a 100
millisecond timer. When the timer goes off, COMM.DRV loops through all open
ports, and does the "time-out check." The timer period is not configurable.

A CN_RECEIVE notification is generated if at receive interrupt time the following
are true:

- CN_RECEIVE notification is enabled.

- The number of characters in the receive queue exceeds cbWriteNotify.

- The number of characters in the receive queue has been below cbWriteNotify
  since the last CN_RECEIVE notification.

-or-

The following are true at time-out check:

- CN_RECEIVE notification is enabled.

- The port has at least one character in its receive queue.

- The number of characters in the receive queue is less than cbWriteNotify.

- A time-out CN_RECEIVE has not already been sent since the last character
  arrived at the port.

A CN_TRANSMIT notification is generated if at transmit interrupt time the
following are true:

- CN_TRANSMIT notification is enabled.

- The number of characters in the transmit queue is less then cbOutQueue.

- The number of character in the transmit queue has been above cbOutQueue since
  the last CN_TRANSMIT notification.

The Windows 3.1 Software Development Kit (SDK) documentation for
EnableCommNotification() contains an incorrect sentence in the comments
section:

  Similarly, a WM_COMMNOTIFY message in which the CN_RECEIVE flag is set is
  sent only when the output queue is larger than the number of bytes specified
  in the cbOutQueue parameter.

This should be replaced by:

  Similarly, a WM_COMMNOTIFY message in which the CN_TRANSMIT flag is set is
  sent only when the number of bytes in the output queue first exceeds and then
  falls below the number of bytes specified in the cbOutQueue parameter.

COMM.DRV has a bug that can generate extra CN_RECEIVE or CN_TRANSMIT
notifications. For additional information, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
