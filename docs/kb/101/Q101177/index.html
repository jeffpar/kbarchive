The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Sun Microsystems has announced that version 5.0 of its PC-NFS network operating
system software supports connectivity with Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
(WFWG) version 3.1. This article describes how to set up PC-NFS with Windows for
Workgroups. This procedure is designed for use with PC-NFS version 5.0 only;
previous versions of PC-NFS are not compatible with Windows for Workgroups.


Microsoft will assist in the installation of PC-NFS with Windows for Workgroups.
Sun Microsystems is responsible for supporting the installation, configuration,
and use of PC-NFS. Customers who have issues that cannot be resolved with
standard network troubleshooting should contact Sun Microsystems for assistance.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Installing WFWG and PC-NFS Version 5.0
--------------------------------------

To use PC-NFS version 5.0 with Windows for Workgroups version 3.1, you must use
the updated WFWNET.DRV driver included with PC-NFS. To update the driver, simply
delete the current version located in your WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory, and
replace it with the current version.

To install and provide connectivity to PC-NFS and Windows for Workgroups, do the
following:

1. Install Windows for Workgroups version 3.1.

2. Run the PC-NFS Install program, and select NDIS as the network adapter.

3. Run the QuickNDIS utility, and configure it for Windows for Workgroups.

4. Run the Winstall program.

NOTE: For further information about installing and configuring PC-NFS, refer to
your PC-NFS documentation.

The installation program for Sun PC-NFS makes changes to the AUTOEXEC.BAT,
CONFIG.SYS, PROTOCOL.INI, and SYSTEM.INI files. These changes are documented in
your PC-NFS installation guide.

AUTOEXEC.BAT

The following lines are added to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, but the SET statements
vary with each installation:

     Set TZ=EST5EDT
     Set NFSDRIVE=C
     Set NFSPATH=C:\NFS
     Set TN_DIR=C:\NFS\TELNET
     C:\NFS\PRT *
     C:\NFS\NET INIT
     C:\NFS\RTM

CONFIG.SYS The following lines are added to the CONFIG.SYS file after the device
drivers installed by Windows for Workgroups. The lines should appear in this
order:

     Device=C:\NFS-NDIS.SYS
     Device=C:\NFS\PCNFS.SYS
     Device=C:\NFS\SOCKDRV.SYS

PROTOCOL.INI

The following section is added to the PROTOCOL.INI file:

     [NFS-NDIS]
     DriverName=NFSLINK$
     Bindings=MS$ELNKII

SYSTEM.INI

The following lines are added to the identified sections of the SYSTEM.INI file:

     [Boot]
     secondnet.drv=pcnfs.drv

     [386Enh]
     secondnet=pcnfs.386

WFWG and Previous Versions of PC-NFS
------------------------------------

If you install Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 on a network running a version
of PC-NFS earlier than version 5.0, Windows for Workgroups does not display a
warning that this version of PC-NFS is not supported. (Normally, Windows for
Workgroups issues a warning during setup if the currently installed networking
software is not compatible with Windows for Workgroups.)

Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 Setup does not have the ability to detect the
presence of a PC-NFS network.


To run Windows for Workgroups properly on a Sun PC-NFS workstation, you must
either update your PC-NFS software to version 5.0 or remove all references to
PC-NFS connectivity from the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. If you don't
remove the references to the Sun client software before rebooting, the system
may stop responding (hang) as the conflicting network device drivers attempt to
load.
