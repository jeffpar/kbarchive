The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5, 2.5a 
- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
- Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a

SUMMARY
=======

A compiler cannot be accessed either in a stand-alone or compact executable
file, so the Relational Query By Example (RQBE) screen is not available for the
user to modify a query. However, the user can use macro substitution to modify
an SQL SELECT statement as needed within an executable file.

This technique will work in FoxPro for Windows with some modification. FoxPro for
Windows does not create stand-alone executable files, but is capable of
providing stand-alone applications. However, the query builder is not available
in executable files built with the FoxPro for Windows Distribution Kit because
it is intended to be used in interactive mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This code example below uses the Clients table found in the
\Sample\Organize\dbfs folder of FoxPro 2.x. The code assumes the Clients table
resides in the current folder. If you use this code with Visual FoxPro, then it
is assumed that the Clients table from FoxPro 2.x was copied into the current
folder.

The following program, which can be compiled into a stand-alone executable file,
allows the user to dynamically change the SQL SELECT statement as needed:

     USE CLIENTS.DBF
     GETEXPR to x
     GETEXPR to y
     SELECT * FROM clients WHERE &amp;x HAVING &amp;y INTO CURSOR Test
     BROWS
   
     PROCEDURE notcalled
     SELECT * FROM clients WHERE state="CA" HAVING city="Los Angeles"

When the .EXE file is run, two expression boxes appear in succession.

1. In the first, choose STATE from the Field Names box.

2. Type the following, and choose OK.

  " ="TX"" (without the quotation marks)

3. In the next expression box, choose CITY from the Field Names box.

4. Type the following, and choose OK.

  " ="Lubbock"" (without the quotation marks)

This query will produce one record.

NOTE: Because macro substitution is used, the stand-alone executable file may not
have the proper code included to perform the required function so an error may
occur. To avoid this problem, the notcalled procedure includes code for an SQL
SELECT statement. When the executable file is compiled, FoxPro will include the
necessary source code to execute the macro substitution. The notcalled procedure
is not executed by the program.
