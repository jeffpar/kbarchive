- Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft provides SMTPFTP.EXE, SMTPLMN.EXE, SMTPNVL.EXE, and SMTPWIN.EXE,
which replace the SMTPGATE.EXE file that is included with version 3.0 of
the Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP.

For complete information about obtaining and installing the SMTP program
files, see the following sections:

- To download the updated files

- To update your SMTPGATE.EXE file

MORE INFORMATION
================

Version 3.0.9 of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP requires a dedicated 80286,
80386, or 80486 IBM-compatible computer as well as version 3.04.1 or later of
the SMTPPUT.EXE file, update included in PUTUPD.EXE on the MSL. To determine
your version of SMTPPUT, run it from the MS-DOS prompt with the -VER option.

This update contains SMTPFTP.EXE, SMTPLMN.EXE, SMTPNVL.EXE, SMTPXLN.EXE, and
SMTPWIN.EXE, which replace the SMTPGATE.EXE file that is included with version
3.0 of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP. These replacement files correct the
following problems:

- The gateway does not generate greetings (HELO) that include the gateway
  computer host name. This problem occurs when you communicate with an IBM VM
  host running IBM VM SMTP V2R2. (This problem was originally corrected in the
  SMTPGATE.EXE 3.0.2 update.)


- The gateway closes the connection after an Extended HELO (EHLO) message is
  received from another SMTP host as explained in RFC 1425, SMTP Service
  Extensions. There may still be a problem if the host sends an RSET after you
  refuse the EHLO message, which is recommended in RFC 1425, but is not
  consistent with RFC 821. (This problem was originally corrected in the
  SMTPGATE.EXE 3.0.2 update.)


- The recipient field is constructed incorrectly whenever the friendly name
  information is included directly in the address of the recipient. As a
  result, the address is in the form:

  " &lt;&lt;username&gt;@&lt;domain&gt; (&lt;friendly name&gt;)&gt; " (without
  the quotation marks)

  However, per RFC 822, the comment should not be included within the angle
  brackets. (This problem was originally corrected in the SMTPGATE.EXE 3.0.5
  update.)

- When the gateway strips non-SMTP gateway addresses from the message header, a
  false end-of-header marker is created in the RFC 822 portion of the message.
  This causes the date and subject fields, as well as the remaining recipients,
  to appear in the body of the message. (This problem was originally corrected
  in the SMTPGATE.EXE 3.0.7 update.)

  NOTE: Only the updates for the PC/TCP Kernel from FTP Software, Inc., and
  Microsoft LAN Manager for MS-DOS are included with this update.

- The gateway does not allow the default character set translations to be
  overridden. If the two files SMTPIN.TBL and SMTPOUT.TBL exist, the gateway
  can do character translation for one of the following character sets instead
  of for the US-ASCII character set, which is used when these files do not
  exist: Swedish/Finnish, Norwegian/Danish, German, Latin Alphabet 1, and Code
  Page 850. (This problem was originally corrected in the SMTPGATE.EXE 3.0.6
  update.)

- The gateway improperly processes comments as addresses if a comma appears in
  the comment.


- The gateway improperly rejects an RFC 822 address it has previously accepted
  in the RFC 821 portion of a message.


- The gateway saves the From field seen in the envelope part (RFC-821) of an
  incoming message to use in case the Microsoft Mail recipient wants to reply
  to the message. (This problem was originally corrected in the SMTPGATE.EXE
  3.0.9 update.)


For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q99713How Reply Chooses a From Address

- The gateway does not include the host names in its greeting replies. (This
  problem was originally corrected in the SMTPGATE.EXE 3.0.1 update.)

servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

Decide which SMTP executable file matches your configuration:

Executable file    Vendor TCP/IP software
---------------------------------------------------------------------
SMTPLMN.EXE        Microsoft LAN Manager for MS-DOS
SMTPFTP.EXE        PC/TCP Kernel from FTP Software, Inc.
SMTPNVL.EXE        Novell LAN Workplace for MS-DOS (version 4.0)
SMTPWIN.EXE        Any network adapter card supported by the WIN/TCP
                  for MS-DOS RunTime (version 4.1) from The Wollongong
                  Group, Inc. with the RunTime installed
SMTPXLN.EXE        Excelan Exos 205T Intelligent Ethernet Controller

After you download SMTPGW.EXE to a clean directory, run it (by typing "smtpgw"
(without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt) to extract the contents of
the file. You should receive the following files:

 Filename       Size      Date       Time

To update your SMTPGATE.EXE file
--------------------------------

At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

  " copy &lt;path&gt;:\&lt;smtp???&gt;.exe &lt;destination&gt;\smtpgate.exe "
  (without the quotation marks)

where &lt;path&gt; is the drive and directory where you ran the self- extracting
SMTPGW.EXE file, &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory where your
SMTPGATE.EXE file currently resides, and &lt;smtp???&gt; is the corresponding
executable file for your TCP/IP software vendor.

For example, if you ran the self-extracting file from the TEST directory on drive
D, your SMTPGATE.EXE file is located in the MAILEXE directory on drive C, and
you are using Microsoft TCP/IP for LAN Manager, type the following command and
press ENTER:

  " copy d:\test\smtplmn.exe c:\mailexe\smtpgate.exe " (without the quotation
  marks)

NOTE: The SMTPGATE.EXE file typically resides on the postoffice server in the
Mail executables directory as well as on the machine where the gateway is
running. Make sure that SMTPGATE.EXE, SMTPGET.EXE, and SMTPPUT.EXE are all
located in the same subdirectory where the gateway is launched from and that all
copies are updated appropriately.

To Set Up Character Translation for Non-US-ASCII Character Set
--------------------------------------------------------------

1. Decide which character set is desired. The following is a list of the
  character sets, associated filenames, and references that are located on the
  disk provided with this update:

  Character set    | Inbound      | Outbound    | Reference
  -------------------------------------------------------------
  US-ASCII         | Built in     | Built in    | ANSI X3.4
  Swedish/Finnish  | SWEDISHI.TBL | SWEDISHO.TBL| SIS 63 61 27
  version 2        |              |             | (ISO-646-SE2)
  -------------------------------------------------------------
  Norwegian/Danish | NORWEGI.TBL  | NORWEGO.TBL | NS 455
  version 1        |              |             | (ISO-646-NO)
  -------------------------------------------------------------
  German           | GERMANI.TBL  | GERMANO.TBL | DIN 66003
                   |              |             | (ISO-646-DE)
  -------------------------------------------------------------
  Latin Alphabet 1 | LATIN1I.TBL  | LATIN1O.TBL | ISO 8859-1
  -------------------------------------------------------------
  Code Page 850    | Built-in     | CP850O.TBL  | IBM
                   | default      |             |

  NOTE: If SMTPGATE.EXE does not find the SMTPIN.TBL and SMTPOUT.TBL files, the
  built-in default tables are used.

2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

  " copy &lt;path&gt;:\&lt;??????i.tbl&gt; &lt;destination&gt;\smtp\smtpin.tbl
  copy &lt;path&gt;:\&lt;??????o.tbl&gt; &lt;destination&gt;\smtp\smtpout.tbl "
  (without the quotation marks)

  where &lt;path&gt; is the drive and directory where you ran the self-
  extracting SMTPGW.EXE file, &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory
  where your Microsoft Mail postoffice data files currently reside, and
  &lt;??????i.tbl&gt; and &lt;??????o.tbl&gt; are the corresponding inbound and
  outbound character table files.

  For example, if you ran the self-extracting file from the TEST directory on
  drive D, your Microsoft Mail postoffice is located on drive M, and you are
  using the German translation table, type the following commands and press
  ENTER after each command:

  " copy d:\test\germani.tbl m:\smtp\smtpin.tbl
  copy d:\test\germano.tbl m:\smtp\smtpout.tbl " (without the quotation marks)

  Make sure you have updated the SMTPGATE.EXE file to version 3.0.7 or later;
  otherwise, the character translation won't take place.

Translation Details
-------------------

Inbound messages have the subject and text body translated based on the
SMTPIN.TBL file. Friendly names are not translated.

Outbound messages have the subject and text body translated based on the
SMTPOUT.TBL file. Friendly names are translated based on an internal table that
maps extended characters to a 7-bit equivalent.

NOTE:

- Only 7-bit characters are supported in a Microsoft Mail address, which
  consists of the network name, postoffice name, and mailbox ID.

- The tables for national 7-bit character sets (Swedish/Finnish,
  Norwegian/Danish, and German) will convert characters with character codes
  above 127 according to Latin Alphabet 1 for inbound messages. That is, they
  will accept national characters (F, V, and so forth) according to both 7-bit
  and 8-bit standards.

Gateway Operation
-----------------

Informational messages are displayed on the screen and in the SMTP gateway log
file when you use the -CD (debugging), -LACSY (full logging to SMTPGATE.LOG),
and/or -GACSY (full logging to the SMTPGATE screen) options when you start up
the gateway.

If the SMTP translation files are not found, the following messages are
displayed:

18:02:40 - Open File &lt;f:smtp\smtpin.tbl&gt; failed,

  No such file or directory

18:02:40 - f:smtp\smtpin.tbl table not loaded,

  default translation invoked.

18:02:40 - Open File &lt;f:smtp\smtpout.tbl&gt; failed,

  No such file or directory

18:02:40 - f:smtp\smtpout.tbl table not loaded,

  default translation invoked.

If the SMTP translation file(s) are found and can be loaded, the following
messages are displayed:

  11:19:09 - f:smtp\smtpin.tbl table translation loaded.
  11:19:09 - f:smtp\smtpout.tbl table translation loaded.

If problems with a translation file are detected, the default translation message
and one of the following messages are displayed:

  18:02:40 - File &lt;f:smtp\smtpout.tbl&gt; header size invalid.
  18:02:40 - File &lt;f:smtp\smtpout.tbl&gt; translation checksum invalid.
  18:02:40 - File &lt;f:smtp\smtpout.tbl&gt; translation table size invalid.
