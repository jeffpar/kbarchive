SYMPTOMS
========

Files opened with a UNC name may be closed prematurely. This problem only occurs
when a directory that is part of the UNC path is subsequently connected and then
disconnected.


CAUSE
=====

When the UNC file is opened, a tree ID is created by the server and is sent to
the client Redirector. The tree ID represents the root or mount point on the
server. In the above example, a tree ID will be returned for the directory dir.
For file references, the Redirector includes the tree ID to tell the server
where the path starts on the server. A tree ID has to be obtained before files
can be accessed on the server. A tree ID is also needed to access a directory
mapped to a drive letter. For optimization, the server will return the same tree
ID for both accesses. The problem occurs on the net use /d. The Redirector will
send a tree disconnect request to the server. This request closes all files in
the tree, even files opened with UNC names.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack

Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
