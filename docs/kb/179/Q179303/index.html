The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to shorten the delay between when an event trigger
occurs and when the script is run. It can be useful to change this setting for
testing or demonstration purposes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Event Service uses the Information Store's local replication interface
(Incremental Change Synchronization, or ICS) to retrieve a list of changes that
have occurred in the store. When something changes in the store, the Event
Service gets notified, which causes it to initiate a "local replication" session
with the store. This produces a "change list" and the Event Service then fires
an event for each qualifying item on the list. By default, the information store
only sends out replication change notifications at 60-second intervals.

The information store has a registry key that controls this interval. You can add
a registry entry to shorten this interval.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

WARNING: You should not change this setting on production machines. There is
overhead associated with local replication session. The Information Store will
operate much more efficiently if it is allowed to process several changes in a
single replication session, rather than starting a new session for each change.

To add the new entry, perform the following steps:

1. Start the registry editor (regedit.exe).

2. Open the following subkey:

  \HKLM\System\currentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersSystem

3. Add the following DWORD value:

  ICS Notification Interval

4. Change this value to the number of seconds that you want the store to wait
  for replication notifications.
