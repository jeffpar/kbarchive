- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word 97, if you open a document from an earlier version of Word or
from another word processing program that uses the MS LineDraw Font, you cannot
use this font to draw lines or boxes.

CAUSE
=====

The MS LineDraw font is included in earlier versions of Microsoft Word, MS- DOS,
and Microsoft Windows 3.0, and is not intended as a drawing tool.

This font is intended for importing documents that contain line drawings from
MS-DOS based programs, such as WordPerfect. Word 97 identifies the MS LineDraw
font as a symbol font, and interprets text in the MS LineDraw font as a series
of symbols. Therefore, many formatting and proofing features of Word ignore this
text.

WORKAROUND
==========

To draw lines or boxes within Word, use the drawing tools and features that ship
with Word to create lines, outlines, boxes and other shapes. To do this, follow
these steps:

1. Turn on the Drawing toolbar by pointing to Toolbars on the View menu, and
  clicking Drawing.

2. Use the Drawing toolbar buttons to draw the shapes you want.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Courier New font contains the exact same character set as MS LineDraw. Word
97 should map the MS LineDraw font to Courier New; however, because there are
several versions of the Courier New font, Word may or may not map it correctly.
The Courier New version 2.0 font should allow the correct mapping of the MS
LineDraw font.

To access the line drawing characters that used to be available in MS LineDraw,
click Symbol on the Insert menu, and then click (Normal Text) in the Font list.

For additional information about the MS LineDraw font, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
