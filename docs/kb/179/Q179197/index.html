SYMPTOMS
========

This problem occurs when you are using the LinkAge Connector for Lotus Notes 3.2
with Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 or 5.0, or when you are using Microsoft
Exchange Server 5.5.

The Lotus Notes e-mail client (versions 4.5 and 4.6) may receive an error message
stating "Error loading Metafile" when you open an e-mail message sent from an
Exchange client and delivered either by the Microsoft Exchange Connector for
Lotus Notes (Exchange Server 5.5 Notes Mail Connector [NMC]) or the LinkAge
Connector for Lotus Notes 3.2.

Also, if monitoring connector processing using the Exchange Server Connectivity
Administrator and its logging options, a sequence similar to the following may
be logged:

CAUSE
=====

The error typically occurs when a user sends a copy of a dialog box that has
appeared on the screen, or does a screen capture image of an application.

With the LinkAge Connector for Lotus Notes 3.2, there were known issues with
mapping various OLE properties between the two e-mail clients. Generally,
graphic objects presented the most obvious interoperability problems. These are
known limitations of the LinkAge Connector for Lotus Notes 3.2.

With Exchange Server 5.5 and its Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes,
OLE object interoperability between Exchange Server and Notes is much improved.
However, bitmap graphics copied into the Windows clipboard (using ALT+PRINT
SCREEN), and subsequently pasted into an e-mail message composed using the
Exchange Client WordMail editor and sent to a Notes recipient, will result in
the "Error loading Metafile" message when the Notes recipient attempts to read
the message.

This error occurs because the Notes client's transform routines fail to properly
process inline bitmaps within the RTF_Body when submitted by the NMC. When the
Notes client subsequently tries to open the rich text format (RTF) object, it
causes an error.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

Do not use the WordMail editor to send a screen capture image to Notes
recipients. Use a graphics application to paste the screen capture into another
program, for instance, the Windows Paint utility, before pasting it into the
e-mail message:

1. Capture the screen image by pressing ALT+PRINT SCREEN.

2. Start Paint and paste the screen capture image into this program.

3. In Paint, select the image again using Paint tools.

4. On the Edit menu, click Copy.

5. Paste the image into the e-mail message.
