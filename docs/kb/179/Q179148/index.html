-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
- Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Personal Web Server version 4.0 for NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft has been made aware of an issue in Internet Information Server (IIS)
4.0 and Personal Web Server (PWS) 4.0 in which certain configuration settings
may not be applied when a URL with short file name equivalents is requested.
These configuration setting include restricting access by IP address, PICS
ratings, and requiring SSL encryption. Windows NT file permissions (ACLs) are
not affected.

Users are able to access certain directories or files through IIS 4.0 or PWS 4.0
and bypass specific security settings, such as SSL encryption.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT and Windows 95 file systems (FAT, FAT32, and NTFS) support file
names of up to 255 characters. To maintain compatibility with older, non 32-bit
applications, a short file name (called the 8.3 file name) is created for each
file. This short file name equivalent is used by older applications to access
directories and files with long names. IIS 4.0 and PWS 4.0 maintain certain
configuration information about directories and files in a database called the
metabase. The metabase does not contain file permissions, but rather Web
server-specific information such as requiring SSL encryption, proxy cache
setting, and PICS ratings. Actual file and directory permissions are enforced by
NTFS and are not affected by this problem.

In certain cases when a URL is requested using the short file name, it is
possible that configuration properties specified in the metabase may not be
applied as expected. This issue only occurs where long file names are used for
directories or files, and specific metabase configuration properties are set on
those directories or files. File permissions by a user or group using NTFS
access control lists (ACL) are not affected.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT Server or Workstation 4.0
------------------------------------

NOTE: The supported fix is for IIS and PWS on Windows NT Workstation. A fix for
PWS on Microsoft Windows 95 is still pending.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or the
individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
pack, please go to:

following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you apply the fix, if an 8.3 file or directory name for an equivalent long
file or directory name is used in the URL, the following message occurs:

  HTTP Error 404
  404 Not Found
  The Web server cannot find the file or script you asked for. Please check the
  URL to ensure that the path is correct.
  Please contact the server's administrator if this problem persists.
