SYMPTOMS
========

ClassView's context menu offers both "Go to Declaration" and "Go to Definition"
options for class member functions. However, class data members with the
"static" attribute have only the "Go to Definition" option, and it jumps
incorrectly to the variable's declaration inside the class definition.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++,
version 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Consider the following class, presented for illustration only:

     // Class Definition and member declarations.
     class MyClass
     {
     public:
        // Data members
        static int  i;
        char        c;

        // Function members
        MyClass();
     };

     // Class member definitions.
     int MyClass::i = 0;
     MyClass::MyClass()
     {
        c = 0;
     }

Each instance of "MyClass" contains the normal data member "c". Such members are
normally initialized in the class's constructor. In Visual C++'s ClassView pane,
the menu resulting from right-clicking on MyClass member "c" correctly indicates
that it has no implementation (or definition). However, a static data member,
such as "i" in the example, requires an explicit definition in addition to its
declaration inside the class definition. ClassView's option does not jump
directly to such a definition.

Due to a bug in Visual C++ 6.0, clicking "Go To Definition" for a template class
static member variable displays the following error message:

  Cannot find the definition for this variable.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q154112 ClassView Cannot Find Template Member Function Definition

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a class with a static data member as in the example above.

2. Save the file.

3. Expand the class in VC++'s ClassView pane.

4. Right-click on the static member; there is no "Go to Declaration" option.

Workaround
----------

The following is a suggested workaround:

1. In the ClassView pane, right-click on the member variable.

2. Select "References."

3. Rebuild with browse information if prompted to do so.

4. From the "Definitions" list, jump to either the declaration (.h file) or
  definition (.cpp file).
