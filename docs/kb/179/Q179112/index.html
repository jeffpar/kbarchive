SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to distribute drawing objects horizontally or vertically,
relative to page, and the page orientation is set to landscape, the drawing
objects are distributed calculated on a portrait orientation page width and
height instead of the landscape orientation page width and height.

WORKAROUND
==========

The following Visual Basic for Applications macro provides a workaround for this
problem. Run this macro to evenly distribute selected drawing objects
horizontally between margins.

After you create the macro, you can assign the macro to a toolbar button or menu
item.

     Sub DistributeHoriz()
        Dim iTxtArea As Integer
        Dim iCenters As Integer
        Dim iObjLeft As Integer
        Dim iNumObj As Integer
        ' Get number of selected objects.
        iNumObj = Selection.ShapeRange.Count
        ' If there are no objects selected,
        ' exit this routine.
        If iNumObj = 0 Then Exit Sub
        ' Get area distance between margins.
        With ActiveDocument.PageSetup
           iTxtArea = (.PageWidth - (.LeftMargin + .RightMargin))
        End With
        ' Divide evenly the Text Area between margins
        ' by the number of selected objects. Then
        ' divide by two to get divisional centers.
        iDivisionCenters = (iTxtArea / iNumObj) / 2
        ' Loop number of selected objects to distribute horizontally.
        For i = 1 To iNumObj
           With Selection.ShapeRange(i)
              ' Set each selected object's relative horizontal position
              ' to be relative to margin.
              .RelativeHorizontalPosition =wdRelativeHorizontalPositionMargin
              ' Calculate object placement.
              iObjLeft = ((iTxtArea / iNumObj) * i) - iDivisionCenters
              .Left = iObjLeft - (.Width / 2)
           End With
        Next
     End Sub

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can align two or more drawing objects relative to each other by their left,
right, top, or bottom edges or by their centers (vertically) or middles
(horizontally).

To align one or more drawing objects relative to each other, follow these steps:

1. Select the drawing objects you want to align.

2. Click Draw on the Drawing toolbar.

3. Point to Align Or Distribute and then click the alignment you want.

By default, drawing objects align in relation to each other.

To align one or more drawing objects relative to the entire page, follow these
steps:

1. Select the drawing objects, click Draw, point to Align Or Distribute, and
  click Relative To Page.

2. Click Draw again, point to Align Or Distribute, and then click the alignment
  you want.

You can also use the Align Or Distribute command to arrange or distribute drawing
objects equal distances from each other vertically, horizontally, or in relation
to the entire page.
