-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start a program from the desktop, the Start menu, a
shortcut, or from a file association, you may receive one of the following error
messages:

  Access to the specified device, path or file is denied.

-or-

  Access to the driver, specified path, or file is denied.

NOTE: This problem only affects programs whose executable files are located in
folders within the Program Files folder.

CAUSE
=====

These error messages can occur if any of the following conditions exists:

- You have a Program folder on the same drive as the Program Files folder.

- You are trying to run a program that does not write quoted path strings
  containing long file names into the registry. The execution of a process is
  handled by the Win32 CreateProcess() API. CreateProcess() is unable to
  distinguish between spaces in long file names, and spaces delimiting
  arguments to the function. If a quoted string is passed to the API,
  CreateProcess() is able to make this distinction and starts the program as
  expected.

- In Windows Explorer, the view option is set to hide DLLs. This is the default
  setting and should be changed to "Show all Files" if you receive this error
  message when running a 16-bit program.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use the appropriate method below:

folder, and then press ENTER.


STATUS
======

Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.


MORE INFORMATION

This behavior has been known to occur with the Inbox and Internet Explorer icon,
and with shortcuts pointing to Microsoft Access databases. In addition, if you
