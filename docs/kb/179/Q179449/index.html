SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using Dial-Up Networking, you may receive an error message similar
to the following message on a blue screen:

  An exception 0E has occurred at 0028:0240F000 in VxD ---. This was called
  from 0028:C100D858 in VxD PPPMAC(01) + 00004610.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if an Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) Network Basic
Input/Output System (NetBIOS) wide-area network (WAN) packet is sent over the
connection without first negotiating the protocol.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, upgrade to Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking 1.3. For
information about how to obtain the Dial-Up Networking 1.3 Upgrade, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191494 Dial-Up Networking 1.3 Upgrade Available

This upgrade provides additional features for the Dial-Up Networking (DUN)
support that was first delivered in Windows 95. It includes all of the features
of the first upgrade, widely known as the ISDN Accelerator Pack for Windows 95,
including support for internal ISDN adapters, multilink support for two ISDN
channels, and connection-time scripting to automate non-standard login
connections. In addition to the features of the first upgrade, this upgrade also
delivers PPTP client capability for Windows 95.
