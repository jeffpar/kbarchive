  There was an unexpected error in the grammar checker. Word cannot complete
  the grammar check.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the grammar checker attempts to evaluate a long,
complex sentence that includes several conjunctions such as "or" and "and" along
with at least one preposition such as "of," "to," "by," or "from."

do this, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options, and select the Spelling &amp; Grammar tab.

2. Click to clear the Check Grammar As You Type and Check Grammar With Spelling
  check boxes.
