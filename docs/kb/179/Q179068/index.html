The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Flight Simulator for Windows 95, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Microsoft Flight Simulator for Windows 95 using the Compact
installation option, some scenery areas are not listed in the airports
directory.

CAUSE
=====

The missing scenery areas are part of the City Pack. The City Pack is not
installed when you use the Compact installation option.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, remove Flight Simulator and then reinstall Flight
Simulator using the Typical or Custom installation options. To do so, use the
following steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

3. Click Microsoft Flight Simulator for Windows 95 and then click Add/Remove.

4. Click Remove All.

5. When you are prompted to confirm the removal of Flight Simulator 95, click
  Yes.

6. When you are prompted to restart Windows, do so.

7. Close Control Panel.

8. Delete the folder in which Flight Simulator is installed. By default, Flight
  Simulator is installed in the following folder:

  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator

  For information about how to delete folders, click Start, and then click Help.
  On the Index tab, type "deleting" (without the quotation marks), and then
  double-click the "Deleting files or folders" topic.

9. Insert the Flight Simulator CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive. If Auto Insert
  Notification is enabled, Setup begins automatically. Follow the instructions
  on the screen.

  NOTE: If Setup does not begin automatically, click Start, click Run, type the
  following line in the Open box, and then click OK

  &lt;drive&gt;:\setup.exe

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the letter of the CD-ROM drive.

10. When you are prompted to select the installation option you prefer, click
  Typical or Custom. If you click Custom, make sure the City Pack check box is
  selected, and then click Continue.

All of the scenery areas should now be listed in the airports directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The City Pack includes both airports and scenery for Bejiing, Cairo, Jerusalem,
Mexico City, Moscow, Panama, Rio De Janeiro, Rome, Sydney, Washington D.C., and
other cities.

The Typical installation option requires approximately 75 MB of hard disk space,
and includes the City Pack.

The Custom installation option can require up to 140 MB of hard disk space if
every option (icluding the City Pack) is selected.
