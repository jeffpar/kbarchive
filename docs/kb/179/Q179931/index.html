SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use walls in Age of Empires to gain an advantage.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To use walls to gain an advantage when you play Age of Empires, follow these
steps:

1. When you start Age of Empires in the Stone Age level, instruct the villagers
  to mine stone.

2. Advance to the Tool Age level.

3. At the stable, create a scout, and then send the scout to reveal the
  locations of all the other civilizations' buildings.

4. At the granary, research the Small Wall technology.

5. When the Small Wall technology is complete, instruct a villager to build
  walls around all of the following enemy buildings:

   - Town Center
   - Storage Pits
   - Barracks
   - Stable
   - Archery Range

  Note that you need only mark the place where you want to build the walls. You
  do not need to build the walls. Enemy units cannot cross the wall markers. To
  break down the walls, your enemy needs siege weapons that are available in
  the Iron Age level.

For additional information about how to play Age of Empires, please see the
Microsoft Age of Empires Game Reference manual included with your Age of Empires
CD-ROM.
