-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a Microsoft Word AutoShape or object that contains a pattern fill
of lines, like the Light Downward Diagonal pattern, it is printed as a solid
color.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you copy a Microsoft Word AutoShape or object and then
paste it as a picture or bitmap.

This occurs because the resolution for a picture or bitmap object is less than
that for a Word AutoShape or object; thus, Word prints it as a solid object
without lines.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem use either of the following methods.

Method 1: Paste as an MS Office Drawing Object
----------------------------------------------

To paste the object as an MS Office Drawing Object, follow these steps:

1. After copying the AutoShape or object, click Paste Special on the Edit menu.

2. Under As, click MS Office Drawing Object and then click OK.

Method 2: Change the Printer Resolution
---------------------------------------

Set the printer resolution to either 75 or 150 dots per inch (dpi) by following
these steps:

1. On the File menu, click Print.

2. Click Properties and then click the Graphics tab.

3. Change the Resolution to either 75 or 150 dpi.

NOTE: This method may cause other graphic printing problems.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Word, an object pasted as a picture or bitmap appears as a black-and- white
image. Word sends its fill patterns to the printer as bitmaps (that is, patterns
of dots or pixels); therefore, the patterns are dependent on the printer
resolution setting to determine the distance between the individual pixels in
the pattern. With a low resolution, the patterns are recognizable. With a high
resolution, the width of the lines and the spacing between each line is so small
that the resulting pattern is printed as a smooth, solid gray color.
