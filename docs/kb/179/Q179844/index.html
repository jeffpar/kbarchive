1.0 Microsoft Exchange Client and Microsoft Schedule+ on the Macintosh

1.1 Installation

1.1.1 Setting Up the Microsoft Exchange Client on Your Macintosh

Your Macintosh must have at least 12 MB of RAM or at least 16 MB of
virtual memory to run the Microsoft Exchange Client and Schedule+.
You will be able to install only the Microsoft Exchange Client if you
have 8 MB of RAM. If you have only 8 MB of RAM and the system
consumes more than 3 MB, you need to remove some extensions for the
Microsoft Exchange Client to run.

Before you start:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the Date &amp; Time icon.

2. Select the appropriate local time zone and verify that the system
  time is correct.

3. To adjust for daylight saving time, in the Date &amp; Time dialog box,
  select the Daylight Savings Time check box.

For older M68000-based Macintosh computers:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the Memory icon.

2. Select 32-bit addressing.

We recommend that you use the Macintosh operating system 7.6 or later.
Additionally, on the Power Macintosh, we recommend that virtual memory
be set to ON and set to a minimum of 1 MB more than the installed
physical memory. For example, if your Power Macintosh has 16 MB of
memory installed, you should set virtual memory to 17 MB.

To install the Macintosh client:

1. Place the Macintosh client compact disc into your Macintosh
  compact disc drive or connect to a share on your network.

2. Open the folder for the language you want to install, if necessary.

3. Open the first installation disk.

4. Double-click Microsoft Exchange Setup and follow the instructions.

5. Run Microsoft Exchange Client and Schedule+ or Microsoft Exchange
  Client only. The Profile Wizard guides you through the process of
  creating a new profile.

1.1.2 Creating a Floppy Disk Setup Version of the Macintosh Client

The files on the client compact disc have been arranged so that users
can create a floppy disk version of the client Setup program. To do
so, copy the contents of each installation directory found on the
compact disc to a separate disk and name each disk with the
corresponding directory name. To set up the client from the floppy
disk, insert the disk named "Install Disk 1" in the disk drive and
run Microsoft Exchange Client Setup.

1.1.3 Connecting Macintosh Clients Through AppleTalk or Using TCP/IP

If your Macintosh clients will be connecting through AppleTalk:

Run Windows NT Services for Macintosh on your Microsoft Exchange
Server computer and establish a zone for that computer.

Tell your users what AppleTalk zone they will be connecting through.

Make sure to verify that your Windows NT MacFile name is the same as
your Microsoft Exchange Server name.

If your Macintosh clients are connecting using TCP/IP, verify that the
Macintosh client can ping the Microsoft Exchange Server IP Address and
NetBIOS name.

1.2 Microsoft Exchange Client and Schedule+ as an Integrated
   Application

Microsoft Exchange Client 5.0 includes the group scheduling component
for the Macintosh client. The scheduling functionality is integrated
into a single program file with the Macintosh Microsoft Exchange
Client, in contrast to the Windows client, where Schedule+ is a
separate application. To use this functionality, run the client and
select Schedule+ from the toolbar.

1.3 Upgrading from a Previous Release of the Macintosh Client

If you upgrade from a previous release of the Macintosh client, the
Show Schedule button may not be displayed on the toolbar. If this
problem occurs, from the Tools menu, choose Customize Toolbar, and
then choose Reset.

1.4 Memory Problems When Using 24-Bit Color Display

If the Macintosh display is using 24-bit color, out of memory problems
can occur when using the Print Preview command in Schedule+.

1.5 Supported Protocols

Both AppleTalk and TCP/IP are supported. If you are using TCP for the
Macintosh, use MacTCP version 2.06 or Open Transport version 1.0 or
later. Open Transport 1.1 or later is recommended for environments
running dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP).

1.6 Personal Folder Files, Personal Address Book Files, and Message
   Files

The file format for personal folders (.pst), personal address books
(.pab), and message files (.msg) is different for Macintosh and
Windows. If you create the folder, personal address book, or a
message file using the Macintosh client, you won't be able to read it
using a Windows client. The reverse is also true. However, you can
move messages from Macintosh to Windows and back by placing them in a
server store and retrieving them on the appropriate operating system.

1.7 Using Forms

To help users know which forms can be used on the Macintosh client
without having to open every message, the Viewer displays symbols for
all messages that should have usable message contents (standard
messages, post notes, resend notes, send and read receipts, signed
messages, and out-of-office messages). Forms that cannot be displayed
on the Macintosh appear with a different symbol.

1.8 Macintosh Printing Issues

1.8.1 Schedule+ Headers and Appointments Print Without Shading

With some printer drivers, Schedule+ headers and appointments print
without shading.

1.8.2 Printing from Microsoft Exchange Client for Macintosh

If printer errors occur while printing from Microsoft Exchange Client
for the Macintosh, disable Background Printing.

1.9 Dayna CommuniCard Ethernet Adapter

When attempting to run Microsoft Exchange Client and Schedule+ on an
Apple PowerBook 5300c that contains a Dayna CommuniCard Ethernet
Adapter, Microsoft Exchange Client or Schedule+ can fail and display
an error 11 as the cause of failure. This problem is caused by an
incompatibility between Microsoft Exchange Client and the Dayna
CommuniCard Ethernet Adapter. You may need to use a different LAN card
to resolve this problem.

1.10 Sending Messages with Embedded OLE Objects Between Windows and
    Macintosh Platforms

When sending messages containing embedded OLE objects between Windows
and Macintosh platforms, the embedded object may not display correctly
when you open the file.

1.11 Unable to View Appointment Description in the Schedule+ Planner
    Tab

When you press CTRL and click an appointment in the Schedule+ Planner
tab, the pop-up window does not stay open for you to view the
description. Instead, you must double-click the appointment to view
the description in the pop-up window.

1.12 Using the Microsoft Exchange Client on a Localized Macintosh
    Operating System

The English, French, and German Microsoft Exchange Clients for the
Macintosh were designed to be run on English and most Western
European languages of the Macintosh operating system (those that
support the Windows code page 10000, Macintosh Roman).

The Japanese Microsoft Exchange Client for the Macintosh was designed
to be run on the Japanese Macintosh operating system (which supports
the Windows code page 10001, Macintosh Japanese).

1.13 Using Rules

1.13.1 Using the Reply With Template with Personal Distribution Lists

You cannot use personal distribution lists (PDLs) with any rules that
use the reply template. This will cause a rule to fail.

1.13.2 Saving a Reply With Template Rule with Security Enabled

If you have security enabled by default, you cannot save a Reply
Template rule.

To create and save a Reply Template rule

1. From the Tools menu, choose Options.

2. Select the Security tab.

3. Under Options, clear the Encrypt message contents and attachments
  and Add digital signature to message check boxes.

4. Set up your rule.

5. Return to the Security tab and select the Encrypt message contents
  and attachments and Add digital signature to message check boxes.

1.13.3 Using the Reply Template with Public Folders

In order to use a reply template in the folder assistant of a public
folder, you must first grant the user Send As permission for that
folder. This is also required to use a custom template response for
a folder that is set up as a moderated folder.

1.14 Working with Folders

1.14.1 Opening Files in Folders

If you cannot open a file in a Microsoft Exchange Client folder,
highlight it, save it to your hard disk, and then use the appropriate
application to open it.

1.14.2 Deleting Items in Public Folders

The following error message can occur when you are deleting an item in
a public folder:

There was a problem deleting the form: You need more memory or system
resources. Close some windows and try again.

If closing some windows doesn't work, you may not have the correct
permissions to delete the item. Contact the owner of the public
folder.

1.14.3 Copying a Moderated Folder From Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0
      to 4.0a Retains Message Rules and Invokes Reply Template

When you copy a moderated folder containing forward and moderated
message rules, you cannot delete rules from the copy. The use of
moderated folders is intended for users running Microsoft Exchange
Server 5.0 so you should not copy folders with these rules already
set up. Also, because the moderated folder was set up on the folder
before it was copied, the Reply Template dialog box is invoked when
you perform a drag and drop action, or copy, move, post, or send to
the copied folder.

1.15 Repairing Offline Folder Files

The Inbox Repair Tool can be used to scan and repair offline folder
files as well as personal folder files.

1.16 Working with Attachments

1.16.1 Encrypted Messages with Message Files

If you save an encrypted message with an attached file to the file
system and you open the saved message from the file system, you
cannot do the following:

Make changes to the message and save it.

Print or forward the open message.

Use the Save As command.

Get properties for the message.

If you attempt to perform these actions, the attachment can disappear.
If this occurs, do not save the message because the attachment will be
lost permanently.

To perform these actions, move the message from the file system to the
Microsoft Exchange Client and edit it there.

1.16.2 Using Files Without Extensions

Some Windows programs do not save their files with file extensions and
can appear without an extension in Microsoft Exchange Client. If you
try to open these messages in Microsoft Exchange Client, you will
receive an error message. However, you can open these files by
highlighting the attachment and saving it to your hard disk where you
can rename it and open it with the appropriate application.

1.17 Working with Messages Without a Security Profile

If you do not have access to your security profile (.epf file) and you
want to reply to a digitally signed message, you must turn off the
digital signature by clicking the Digitally sign message button on
the toolbar. If you want to copy a message, use the File menu in the
Viewer (not the File menu in the message).

1.18 Unable to Copy a Message with Digital Signature Enabled

If a profile is created for a roving user and the location of the .epf
file is not specified, the user cannot copy any messages sent with
digital signature enabled using the Copy command from the File menu of
a Read Message form. Instead, the user can do one of the following to
copy a message with digital signature enabled.

Press and hold down the Option key and drag the message to a folder.

Select the message from the Viewer, and then choose Copy from the
File menu.

1.19 Delivery Receipt Issues

1.19.1 Sending Delivery Receipt Requests Across X.400 Links

If you send a message with a delivery receipt request across an X.400
link that does not support TNEF or MDBEF, the delivery receipt is
sent, but the message properties do not indicate that a delivery
receipt was requested.

1.19.2 Receiving Conflicting Delivery Receipts

If you send a message to multiple recipients (local and remote) and
request a delivery receipt, you will receive a delivery receipt
indicating that the message was received. Depending on how some
remote e-mail agents function, there may be a delay in receiving a
non-delivery receipt or you may never receive a non-delivery receipt.

1.20 Add to Favorites Button Does Not Appear on the Toolbar

The Add to Favorites button can disappear from the toolbar after the
user logs on or off the Microsoft Exchange Client. If this problem
occurs, from the Tools menu, choose Customize Toolbar, and then choose
Reset.

1.21 Security Key Exchange E-form

The Security Key Exchange E-form is not available on Microsoft
Exchange Client for the Macintosh.

1.22 Assigning Custom Permissions

When you give another user custom permissions to modify or read your
appointments, that user may be able to see partial details of other
parts of your schedule. If that user exports your schedule file, he
or she may be able to view partial details of the following:

Items in your To Do list. These may show up as incomplete when they
have actually been marked as finished.

Limited details of contacts, events, annual events, and tasks.

The end date and duration of scheduled items.

1.23 Reading the Received Time on a Meeting Request Form

When you receive a meeting request form that was sent from a location
outside of your time zone, the Received Time indicator reflects the
time zone of the sender, not your local time.

1.24 Previewing Internet Assistant Files

If you choose Preview in the Internet Assistant dialog box and the
command fails, verify that your browser is correctly installed by
double-clicking an .htm file in the Finder. If your browser is not
installed correctly, configure your browser to correctly invoke .htm
files.
