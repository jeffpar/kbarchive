-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Format Painter to copy graphic attributes, such as fill color
and line color, from one graphic to another, the graphic attributes are not
copied.

CAUSE
=====

The Float Over Text setting was turned off when the object was inserted into the
document; thus, the picture was inserted as an inline graphic. The Format
Painter cannot copy properties of inline graphics.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods.

Method 1: Insert the Graphic as a Floating Graphic
--------------------------------------------------

To insert the graphic as a floating graphic, follow these steps:

1. On the Insert menu, point to Picture, and then click From File.

2. In the Insert Picture dialog box, click to select the Float Over Text check
  box.

3. Select the graphic file, and then click Insert.

Method 2: Change the Inline Graphic to a Floating One
-----------------------------------------------------

To change the inline graphic to a floating one, follow these steps:

1. Click the graphic to select it.

2. Right-click the graphic and click Format Picture.

3. Click the Position tab and click to select the Float Over Text check box.

4. Click OK.

Method 3: Add Formatting Directly to the Inline Graphic
-------------------------------------------------------

Depending on the effect you want, you can do one of several things to format the
graphic.

To use the Format Picture dialog box, follow these steps:

1. Click the graphic to select it.

2. Right-click the graphic and click Format Picture.

3. Select the appropriate settings on the Colors And Lines, Size, and Position
  tabs, and then click OK.

To adjust borders and shading, follow these steps:

1. Click the graphic to select it.

2. On the Format menu, click Borders And Shading.

3. Select the appropriate settings for your border and shading and then click
  OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Graphic objects have two sets of properties: one for inline objects and one for
floating objects. The Format Painter will copy only graphic attributes from the
drawing layer.
