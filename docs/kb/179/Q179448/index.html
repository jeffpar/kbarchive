SUMMARY
=======

When your Microsoft Windows NT domain password is less than seven days from
expiration, you may receive notification when you log on requesting you to
change your password. The earliest possible password change notification is
determined as described in the following text, and cannot be changed.

Windows uses an optimized formula to determine when to display network password
change notifications. When Windows clients use network logon password
validation, the account password on the server expires at configurable
intervals. Windows notifies the user that the password will expire soon and that
they should change the password now.

Windows notifies the user to change password when all of the following conditions
are met:

- RelativeTimeRemaining &lt; 7 days

  Basically, the earliest you will receive a notification is 6 days.

- RelativeTimeRemaining &lt; (20% of RelativePasswordAge)

  RelativePasswordAge is going to be governed by the Maximum password age
  parameter in the User Account Manager. With max password age set to greater
  than 30 days, the first notification will always occur at 6 days.

- ServerCurrentTimeOfDay &gt;= PasswdCanChange

Definitions:

RelativePasswordAge: Time since the user password was changed.

PasswdCanChange: Specifies time when the user is allowed to change the password.

PasswdMustChange: Time when the user must change the password.

RelativeTimeRemaining = PasswdMustChange - ServerCurrentTimeOfDay

MORE INFORMATION
================

Note that this value can be changed for Windows NT 4.0 clients. For additional
information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q135403 14 Day Password Change Notification Cannot Be Changed

The password change notification is based on the Maximum Password Age setting in
the User Manager tool in Microsoft Windows NT.
