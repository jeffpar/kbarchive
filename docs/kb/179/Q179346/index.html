-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message when you attempt to generate the
Exchange offline Address Book (OAB):

  An error occurred while generating the offline Address Book. To
  view details, see the application event log in the Windows NT
  Event Viewer on the offline Address Book server.

  Microsoft Exchange Administrator
  ID no. c1031662

The event viewer will log the following event:

  Event ID 5004
  Generation of the offline Address Book is complete. Result: An
  error occurred.

CAUSE
=====

The foreign Details Templates or the One-Off Address Templates, or both, have
been installed, but the corresponding Windows NT Code Pages have not.

If a Foreign Language Container Exists, check under the
site\configuration\addressing\details templates and click on the left hand side
for the various templates (for example, English/USA, French, German). If, after
you click on each template on the left, you see no leaf objects on the right,
you will need to follow the workaround.

Also check under site\configuration\addressing\one-off address templates and
click on the left hand side for the various templates (for example, English\USA,
French, German). If, after you click on each template on the left, you see no
leaf objects on the right, you will need to follow the workaround.

WORKAROUND
==========

The Details Templates, One-Off Address Templates, and the corresponding Windows
NT Code Pages must be installed properly for each language. If they are not
installed properly, then each empty Language Container must be removed from the
directory using the following procedure:

WARNING: Using the raw mode of the Exchange Server Administrator program (admin
/r) incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall
Microsoft Windows NT Server and/or Microsoft Exchange Server. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of raw mode can be
solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.

1. Start the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program in raw mode by executing
  ADMIN.EXE -R from the EXCHSRVR\BIN directory.

2. Open the Details Templates and the One-Off Address Templates objects under
  Configuration/Addressing in the Administrator program.

3. Highlight the foreign language template(s) listed, and then click Delete Raw
  Object from the Edit menu in the Administrator program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Details Templates Language container holds details templates in various
languages (such as U.S./English, German, and Japanese). Details templates let
you customize various dialog boxes.

Path: Organization\ Site\ Configuration Container\ Addressing Container\ Details
Templates Container\ Language Container.

The One-Off Address Templates container holds various One-Off Address Templates
containers, which contain one-off address templates in various languages.
One-off address templates let you view the Microsoft Outlook dialog boxes that
prompt you for one-off e-mail address information.

The One-Off Address Templates Language container holds one-off address templates
in various languages (such as U.S./English, German, and Japanese). One-off
address templates let you view the Microsoft Outlook dialog boxes that prompt
you for one-off e-mail address information.

Path: Organization\ Site\ Configuration Container\ Addressing Container\ One-Off
Address Templates Container\ Language Container.
