SUMMARY
=======

There may be occasions where it will be necessary to migrate your existing SNA
Server configuration to a new computer, or to restore to an existing computer in
the event it is rebuilt due to a hardware failure.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: It is VERY IMPORTANT to keep a backup copy of your SNA configuration file
in a place where it would be unaffected by a harware failure and in a place
where it will not be accidentally deleted. Update the configuration EVERY time a
modification is made. Without a valid current backup, complete restoration of
the existing configuration is impossible.

For more information on backup and restore of the configuration file, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q112636 Backup and Restore of COM.CFG

This scenario assumes that the SNA Subdomain consists of only a single SNA server
and it is properly configured as the Primary Configuration Server. This
procedure would be used in the event of a computer replacement or a complete
rebuild of an existing computer following a fatal hardware problem.

1. Verify that you have a valid backup of your configuration file.

2. Use the Snacfg.exe utility to have a text copy printed to be used in steps 5
  and 7.

3. Remove server from the network physically by shutting the computer off. Then
  remove the server's machine account in the Windows NT Domain using Server
  manager.

4. Install Windows NT Server along with current Service Pack levels. Add the
  computer to the Windows NT domain with the same machine name as the original.
  Also verify that the same LAN transport protocols are installed. If using
  TCP/IP, make sure that the proper IP address is assigned.

5. Install SNA Server. Make sure that proper Link Services are installed. These
  would normally be the same Link Services that were installed previously
  unless the server to host physical connection has been changed. For example,
  a Token Ring card was replaced by Ethernet.

6. Restore the SNA Configuration from backup file.

7. Make sure that connections are configured with the proper Link Service.

8. After verifying proper operation, update SNA Server to the Service Pack level
  that was installed previously, or to the latest Service Pack if a newer one
  is available.

9. Backup configuration file in a place where it would be unaffected by a
  harware failure and in a place where it will not be accidentally deleted.
