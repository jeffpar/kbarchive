CD-ROM: Updated Script Files To Accommodate 25 Users
----------------------------------------------------

On the Instructor CD, the setup script files are designed to accommodate a class
of 12 students. We have made available updated script files that will
accommodate a class of 25 students.

These updated script files are available in the self-extracting executable file
25script.exe. After downloading the file, double-click on 25script.exe, extract
the files into the /Setup folder on your computer, and allow the extracted files
to overwrite existing files of the same file names.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  25script.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/MSPressPub/update/1.0/NT5/EN-US/25script.exe)
