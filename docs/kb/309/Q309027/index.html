MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 101: Incorrect Arrow Directions In Figure 3.13
---------------------------------------------------

On page 101, in Figure 3.13, the arrows into and out of the external system's MTA
(lower right) are reversed. The "MTS Out" should go towards the "MTA", and the
"MTS In" should come from the "MTA".


Page 119: Incorrect Statement About Moving Servers Between Admin Groups
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 119, please remove the first statement at the top of the page:

"However, it is possible to move servers between routing groups in the same
administrative group."

It is not possible to move servers between Admin Groups in Exchange 2000 Server.


Page 362: Incorrect SSL Port Number In Table 11.1
-------------------------------------------------

On page 362, in Table 11.1,

Change:
"433"

To
"443"


Page 427: "Read As" Should Be "Receive As"
------------------------------------------

On page 427, in last line of the second paragraph, change:

"Read As permissions"

To:

"Receive As permissions"


Page 519: STMP Should Be SMTP
-----------------------------

On page 519, in the first line of the first paragraph, change:

"Modern Extended STMP..."

To:

"Modern Extended SMTP..."


Page 538: Group D Should Be Group A
-----------------------------------

On page 538, in the bottom Note section, change:

"If the connection had been marked unavailable before routing group D began
routing the message,"

To:

"If the connection had been marked unavailable before routing group A began
routing the message,"


Page 840: "Internet Messenger" Should Be "Instant Messaging"
------------------------------------------------------------

On page 840, in the last heading,

Change:
"Components of the Internet Messenger Service"

To:
"Components of the Instant Messaging Service"


Page 988: Incorrect Number Of Storage Groups and Stores
-------------------------------------------------------

On page 988, the answer for question 7 contains an incorrect number of storage
groups and stores.

Change:
"You can manage up to 16 individual storage groups on a single Exchange 2000
server, and each storage group is capable of holding up to six individual
stores. This gives you the capability to create a maximum of 96 physical
stores..."

To:
"You can manage up to 4 individual storage groups on a single Exchange 2000
server, and each storage group is capable of holding up to 5 individual stores.
This gives you the capability to create a maximum of 20 physical stores..."

Note: Although the Extensible Storage Engine (ESE) code allows 16 storage groups,
Exchange 2000 Server only allows a maximum of 4 storage groups containing a
maximum of 5 databases for each storage group. This limit is enforced inside the
Exchange System Manger snap-in, so administrators cannot create more storage
groups than the system allows.

For more information, please refer to the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
article:

Q251123: Maximum Number of Storage Groups in Exchange 2000 for Database Capacity
Planning


Page 995: Incorrect Memory Requirement For Outlook 2000
-------------------------------------------------------

On page 995, in the first question, change:

"16 MB of RAM"

To:

"8 MB of RAM"
