MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 23: Incorrect Diagram
--------------------------

In the diagram on page 23, the cd.litwareinc.com and dvd.litwareinc.com domains
are incorrectly placed under the proseware.com domain.

They should be placed under the litwareinc.com domain.


Page 29: Correction To Question 70-219.01.04.001's Answers
----------------------------------------------------------

On page 29, in question 70-219.01.04.001, the correct answer should be B, not D.

Change the answers to be:
"Correct Answers: B
...
B. Correct: Designing the OU hierarchy by location is appropriate if management
of IT with a domain is handled according to the location of the objects being
managed, which is the case here.
...
D. Incorrect: The question provides no information regarding business functions
of various groups within the company. In general, OU hierarchy should be based
on geographic location, rather than business function, as geographic locations
are less likely to change."


Page 29: Austin Should Be Richmond
----------------------------------

There is an error on page 29, in choice D above "Objective 1.4 Answers".

Change:
"D. Design three OUs, a parent OU representing the Austin location, and two child
OUs representing the Chicago and Austin locations."

To:
"D. Design three OUs, a parent OU representing the Austin location, and two child
OUs representing the Chicago and Richmond locations."


Pages 98 and 100: Corrections To Question 70-219.03.03.001
----------------------------------------------------------

For pages 98 and 100, in question 70-219-.03.03.001, remove paragraph B on each
page:

"B. Within each division, create an OU for each job category. Link a GPO to each
job category-based OU." (page 98)

"B. Incorrect: If you create an OU for each job category and link a GPO to each
job category at the division level, each job category OU in the division
inherits all the GPOs and you would then need to use security groups to filter
group policy in order to influence the appropriate users." (page 100)
