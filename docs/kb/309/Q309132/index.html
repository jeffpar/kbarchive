-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When trying to launch the Swedish retail version of Microsoft (r) Office XP
Professional Step by Step Interactive Training (CD 3 in Swedish Office XP retail
box) and logging in after a MINIMAL installation was performed, the user is
presented with a dialog box stating that the CD is not available.

CAUSE
=====

The product is looking for an entry in the setup.ini file located on the CD.
This entry is missing, causing the product to behave as if the CD is not
present.

WORKAROUND
==========

The workaround for this issue requires that the user modify the Affinity key in
the lrun32.ini file which is found in the Windows folder (typically c:\windows
or c:\winnt). To modify this key, do the following: 1. Open the lrun32.ini in a
text editor (e.g. Notepad). 2. Find the section called o10r (sections are
delimited by braces so the relevant section would look like this: [o10r]). 3.
Underneath that section, find the Affinity key. It should have a value of 1
(where Affinity=1). 4. Change the value of the Affinity key to 0 (zero) where
Affinity=0. 5. Save the file. 6. Launch the training application from the
desktop shortcut.
The training should now open and read the data from the CD-ROM drive.

STATUS
======

Known issue.
