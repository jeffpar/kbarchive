SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert a drop-down form field into the detail section of an .htx file,
FrontPage does not include a way to populate the drop- down with data from the
IDC query.

CAUSE
=====

The HTML construction necessary to achieve this effect is character based rather
than tag based. This particular implementation, although popular, is not defined
in any of the working documents of the Internet Engineering Task Force. When
FrontPage parses this type of construction, it is unable to fit it within a
logical tree based on HTML standards.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without warranty
either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied
warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular purpose. This
article assumes that you are familiar with the programming language being
demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug procedures. Microsoft
support professionals can help explain the functionality of a particular
procedure, but they will not modify these examples to provide added
functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific needs. If you have
limited programming experience, you may want to contact a Microsoft Certified
Partner or the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more
information about Microsoft Certified Partners, please visit the following
Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/partner/referral/

For more information about the support options that are available and about how
to contact Microsoft, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

To create a list box populated by an IDC query that returns the value of the
selected option, use the HTML Markup command on the Insert menu in FrontPage
Editor and insert code similar to the following

     &lt;SELECT name="your_list_box"&gt;
        &lt;%begindetail%&gt;
        &lt;option&gt;&lt;%The_field_you_want_from_your_recordset%&gt;&lt;/option&gt;
        &lt;%enddetail%&gt;
     &lt;/SELECT&gt;

where "your_list_box" is the name of the drop-down, and
"The_field_you_want_from_your_recordset" is a valid field in the recordset
returned by the IDC query associated with this .htx file.
