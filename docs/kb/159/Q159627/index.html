-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0, on platform(s):
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

TN5250 clients that are connecting to an SNA Server that has connections to
multiple AS/400s cannot specify which AS/400 to connect to.

CAUSE
=====

The TN5250 RFC (RFC 1205) does not include a specification that would allow
TN5250 clients to specify an AS/400 to connect to. Therefore, the TN5250 service
included with SNA Server 3.0 was not designed to support a mechanism that would
allow TN5250 clients to connect to a specific AS/400.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Set up multiple computers running SNA Server and running the TN5250 service.
  Each one must have a connection to a different AS/400.

2. Configure the TN5250 client(s) to connect to the TCP/IP Address or Host Name
  of the computer running SNA Server that has a connection to the AS/400 that
  the client(s) wants to connect to.

NOTE: Only one instance of the TN5250 Server service can be used on a computer
running SNA Server. To support this resolution, multiple computers running SNA
Server must be used, each running a different TN5250 Server service.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
