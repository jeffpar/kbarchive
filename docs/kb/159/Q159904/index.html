-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

A white paper on ShivaRemote is located on Microsoft TechNet and can also be
found on the following World Wide Web location:

  http://www.microsoft.com/Exchange/

This article explains how to use ShivaRemote with the Microsoft Exchange Windows
3.x client, with LAN Manager version 2.2c with TCP/IP. Use the Config.sys,
Autoexec.bat, and Protcol.ini files shown at the end of this article as models.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Server Considerations
---------------------

Configure the Remote Access Server (either Windows NT or a Shiva LanRover) to
allow remote clients to request a predetermined IP address. To use this option
in Windows NT:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the Network icon.

2. Click RAS, click Network, and click Server Settings.

3. Click TCP, and select the "Allow remote clients to request a predetermined IP
  address" check box.

The following article has additional information on RAS:

  Q158124 XCLN: ShivaRemote with Exchange - RAS Server Considerations

Client Configuration
--------------------

Install LAN Manager version 2.2c software on the client computer. This is located
on the Windows NT 3.51 Server compact disc in the
Clients\Lanman\Disks\Disk1\Setup directory.

NOTE: If LAN Manager has already been installed, run Setup.exe from the LAN
Manager installation directory (Lanman.dos by default).

1. Configure LAN Manager with the following options:

   - TCP/IP (only) bound to the network card driver

   - A static IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway

   - DHCP disabled

2. Manually add entries for the Microsoft Exchange Server computer name and IP
  address in the HOSTS file. This file is located in the
  &lt;drive&gt;:\Lanman.dos\Etc directory, where &lt;drive&gt; is the letter of
  the local hard disk drive where LAN Manager is installed.

3. Configure LAN Manager with the following options:

   - Username and HostName in the Advanced dialog box

   - Windows Sockets enabled in the Advanced dialog box

   - Computername, Username, and Domain in the Workstation Settings dialog box

4. Install the Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client.

5. In the Config.sys file, manually add the following line:

     DEVICE=C:\EXCHANGE\DIALNDIS.EXE(after DEVICE=...\PROTMAN.DOS
     /i:C:\LANMAN.DOS)

6. In the Config.sys file, remark out or remove the line that loads the network
  card driver.

7. In the \Lanman.Dos\Protocol.ini file, manually edit the following:

  [TCPIP_XIF]
  ;BINDINGS = "LAN Card Driver"     Remark out this line
  BINDINGS = SDIALIN$               Add this line

  [SDIALIN$]                        Add this line
  DriverName = SDIALIN$             Add this line

8. Run Connectw.exe to bring up the ShivaRemote Connect window.

9. On the Tools menu, click Port Setup to configure the modem port.

10. Click the Options button to select the IP protocol and type the static IP
  address of the client computer. For more information on creating and saving
  a connection file, refer to the ShivaRemote Online Guide.

11. Save the new connection information and quit the Connect.exe utility.

12. Restart the computer. If you receive any errors during startup, resolve
  these before continuing.

13. Open the connection file you want and click the Connect button. After the
  connection has been established, quit the Connect program. You should see
  the message regarding the static IP address. Make sure this is the same IP
  address which is statically assigned to the client computer.

14. Next, attempt to PING the IP address and host name of the computer running
  Microsoft Exchange Server. The PING.EXE utility is located in the
  \LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG directory. If PINGing the host name fails, but PINGing
  the IP address works, the HOSTS file must be modified (see Step 2 above).
  This step is necessary for the Microsoft Exchange client to connect to the
  server.

15. Start the Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client (online, as a test). Type
  the User Name (Exchange Mailbox Name), the Password (Windows NT Domain
  Password), and the Domain (Windows NT Domain Name that your account is in)
  and verify you can be properly logged in.

If the above step allows you to properly send/receive mail, ShivaRemote and
Microsoft Exchange are configured correctly.

The Microsoft Exchange client remote capabilities can now be configured (remote
mail or offline folders).

To set up the Microsoft Exchange client to automatically dial while working
offline:

1. In Control Panel Mail-Fax, select the properties for Exchange Server in the
  profile and on the "dial up networking" tab.

2. Click the Shiva connection name that was tested in step 1 under "dial using
  the following connection."

3. Type the user name, password, and domain name in the dialog box.

Start the Microsoft Exchange client offline and select either the "remote
mail/connect" or the "sync this folder" check box. Shiva will dial and transmit
necessary information (depending on whether off-line folders [.ost files] or
.pst files are being used).

NOTE: To disconnect, either run Connect.exe again and select Disconnect or type
"connect /d" from the command line.

Sample Configuration Files
--------------------------

Use these Config.sys, Autoexec.bat, and Protocol.ini files as models.

NOTE: In order to format this article for the Web, some line breaks in this file
sample had to be changed. In the Config.sys file, the following line should be
part of the line that preceded it:

  /i:C:\LANMAN.DOS

In the Autoexec.bat file, the following line should be part of the line that
preceded it:

  2.2a

  Config.sys
