The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Mail destined outside of the site via X.400 Connector may be rerouted out to
another seemingly "illogical" and higher cost site, and then routed back into
the site with the X.400 Connector to the target site. The message then routes
out the appropriate connector.

Additionally, the GWART0.MTA within a site will list a redundant, "circular"
route back into itself similar to the following:

  c=&lt;US&gt;
   a=&lt;SOME-NAME&gt;
    p=&lt;COMPANY&gt;
          ROUTE1, 0001
          /O=SOME-NAME/OU=NEW-YORK/../CN=ROUTE1

          SITE CONNECTOR (UNITED KINGDOM), 0002
          /O=SOME-NAME/OU=NEW-YORK/../CN=SITE CONNECTOR (UNITED KINGDOM)
          /O=SOME-NAME/OU=UNITED KINGDOM/../CN=SITE CONNECTOR (NEW-YORK)

According to the above GWART taken from a server in the NEW-YORK site, messages
addressed to the address space "c=US;a=SOME-NAME;p=COMPANY;..." have two
possible routes: the lowest cost is via ROUTE1, with a cost of 0001; the second
route is a site connector to the United Kingdom, but it is a circular route that
routes out to UNITED KINGDOM, and returns back into the NEW-YORK site.

In extreme cases, this may contribute to slow mail delivery, MTA queue backlogs,
and possibly non-delivery reports (NDRs).

CAUSE
=====

The routing calculation logic calculates all possible routes, including circular
routes. The algorithm then filters out the circular routes, removing them from
the routing information database (RID). There was a bug in the filtering process
that resulted in a failure to remove the last circular route.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. On the Configuration menu, click Site Addressing.

2. Clear the "Share address space with other X.400 systems" check box.

NOTE: If Microsoft Exchange Server is deployed in a messaging environment where
it must coexist with an existing X.400 message handling system (MHS) and share
the same address space, the "Share address space" check box must be selected. If
Microsoft Exchange Server must share an existing address space, there is no
workaround.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server version 4.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

One server in a site is "responsible" for rebuilding the RID for the site. The
server maintaining this responsibility will have its Distinguished Name (DN)
listed under raw properties for "Configure, Site Addressing, Rid- Server".

MTAs within the site use an image of this routing table in memory and maintain
two copies of it in text files on disk

NOTE: Do not modify these files. Editing the following files will not affect
routing):

  \EXCHSRVR\MTADATA\GWART0.MTA and GWART1.MTA.

GWART0 is a copy of what is currently in use, and GWART1 is a copy of the RID
prior to the current one. The RID is automatically rebuilt approximately 10
minutes after any change affecting routing replicates within the site.
Additionally, it is rebuilt according to the schedule specified under
"Configuration, Site Addressing, Routing Calculation Schedule" and can be forced
to rebuild under: "Configuration, Site Addressing, Routing, Recalculate Routing"
or "&lt;servername&gt;, Message Transfer Agent, Recalculate Routing."
