-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a communications program has been configured to automatically answer incoming
calls and the computer is placed into a Suspended power- management state, the
computer does not resume when an incoming call arrives.

CAUSE
=====

This functionality, known as "Resume On Ring," is designed to allow the modem to
awaken the computer from a suspended state when an incoming call arrives if the
modem has been configured to automatically answer incoming calls.

The Advanced Power Management features of Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2)
do not support this functionality.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, do not suspend the computer when the modem is
configured to automatically answer incoming calls.


STATUS
======

This problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install
the current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Resume On Ring feature is supported by the PC Card Event WakeUp mechanism
defined in the ExCA specification. This is an optional mechanism, and it is not
supported by all PC Card modems.

When a modem port is opened by a program, the modem is powered up in a persistent
state. When the computer is suspended, the modem is set up for Resume On Ring,
if it can be, because it is in a persistent-on power state.
