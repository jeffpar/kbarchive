-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article outlines the steps involved in making the Thrustmaster Formula T2
steering wheel work with Windows 95/98 and Monster Truck Madness.

There are three parts to the Formula T2:

- Steering console
- Pedal platform
- Converter

For the Formula T2 to work properly under Windows 95/98, you must use the
converter. The converter is supplied with the Formula T2. If you do not have
one, you will need to contact Thrustmaster at (503) 615-3200.

CONFIGURING THE FORMULA T2
--------------------------

To ensure proper configuration, perform the following steps below in the order
specified.

Setting Up the Connection If You Have a Joystick Icon:

NOTE: Windows 95/98 needs to be restarted with the Formula T2 in the game port
before you can begin configuring the Formula T2 within Windows.

1. Once Windows has been restarted, click Start, point to Settings, and then
  click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Joystick icon.

3. Under Joystick, click Custom.

  NOTE: To have Windows recognize the Formula T2, you must choose Custom option
  for the input device.

4. In the Custom window, click 2 Axis, 4 button, make sure the Special Features
  box is selected, then select the option for "Is a race car controller".

5. Click OK to get back to the Joystick Properties window.

6. Click Calibrate and follow the directions to calibrate the Formula T2.

7. Click Test to test the Formula T2. (You should be able to steer left and
  right, press the gas pedal to move the cross hairs up, press the brake pedal
  to move the cross hairs down, press the stick shift forward and backward to
  display buttons 1 and 2, and press the two red buttons to display buttons 3
  and 4.)

8. Click Apply, then click OK to exit the Joystick Properties window.

9. Close Control Panel.

Setting Up the Connection If You Have a Gaming Devices Icon:

1. Once Windows 95/98 has been restarted, click Start, point to Settings and
  click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Gaming Devices icon.

3. Click Device Assignment, then click Custom.

  NOTE: To have Windows recognize the Formula T2, you must choose Custom option
  for the input device.

4. In the Custom window, click 2 Axis, 4 button, make sure the Special Features
  box is selected, then select the option for "Is a race car controller."

5. Click OK until you're back to the Gaming Device Properties window.

6. Click Settings, then click Calibrate and follow the directions to calibrate
  the Formula T2.

7. Click the Test tab to test the Formula T2. (You should be able to steer left
  and right, press the gas pedal to move the cross hairs up, press the brake
  pedal to move the cross hairs down, press the stick shift forward and
  backward to display buttons 1 and 2, and press the two red buttons to display
  buttons 3 and 4.)

8. Click Apply, then click OK to exit the Gaming Device Properties window.

9. Close Control Panel.

To Configure the Formula T2 Within Monster Truck Madness:

1. Start Monster Truck Madness.

2. On the Options menu, click Controls.

3. Click Race Car Controller for the Primary Driving Control.

4. Click Calibrate and follow the instructions to calibrate the steering wheel.

  NOTE: When asked to turn your steering wheel all the way to the left and
  right, you only need to do this once. Once to the left, and once to the
  right. If you go back and forth several times, it may interfere with the
  calibration process. The same can be said for the gas and brake pedals. Press
  the pedals once to calibrate them.

5. Click OK after you have calibrated the steering wheel.

You're now ready to begin racing.

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

The most common reason for the Thrustmaster Formula T2 to not work under the
Windows 95/98 environment is the input on the audio card, or game port, cannot
provide the information fast enough for Windows to understand that the Formula
T2 is attached to the card. The input may provide information quickly enough for
MS-DOS based games, but may not be sufficient enough to provide information for
the Windows 95/98 environment. The best solution for this is to try a different
audio card or game port card.

If the Formula T2 seems to work correctly within Windows 95/98, but not within
Monster Truck Madness, run through the calibration process for both Windows
95/98 and Monster Truck Madness again.
