SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to upgrade your current version of Windows NT, the following
error message may appear:

  A previous version of Windows NT could not be found on the system, Press F3
  to exit.

If you are using the Upgrade CD-ROM Media, the following error message may
appear:

  No previous version of Windows NT could be found on your computer. Setup is
  unable to verify that you qualify to use this upgrade product. Press F3 to
  exit.

If you have a previous version of Windows NT, Setup lets you install a new copy
of Windows NT 4.0, but Setup will not allow you to upgrade to Windows NT 4.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) to modify the following values:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and locate the following subkey:

  Hkey_Local_Machine\System\Setup\SystemSetupInProgress
  Hkey_Local_Machine\System\Setup\UpgradeInProgress

2. Double-click SystemSetupInProgress and change the value from 1 to 0.

3. Locate the following subkey:

  Hkey_Local_Machine\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\ 
  CurrentVersion\

4. Verify the following registry entry is set to 3.5 or 3.51.

  CurrentVersion:REG_SZ:3.5 or 3.51

5. Quit Registry Editor and then restart your computer for these changes to take
  effect.

Clearing both to zero will allow Windows NT to prompt for the previous
installation upgrade.

NOTE: For additional information on difficulty upgrading Windows NT 4.0, please
see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  TITLE: Windows NT 4.0 Upgrade CD Will Not Upgrade NT 4.0 Installation

  ARTICLE-ID: Q160175
  TITLE: What Does WinNT 4.0 look for in a Valid WinNT 3.51 Install


MORE INFORMATION
================

During the upgrade process, Windows NT Setup verifies the following before
providing an upgrade option to existing installations. If the above steps do not
resolve the upgrade option, verify the following components are present and/or
correct.

- Ensure the current version of Windows NT is bootable before proceeding with
  an upgrade.

- Make sure the SCSI or IDE controller detected by Windows NT 4.0 Setup is the
  correct driver. (You may need to select F6 during setup do manually install
  the correct driver.)

- The Boot.ini file must contain a valid ARC path for the current system
  partition.

- A valid Setup.log file must be present in the %SystemRoot%\Repair directory.

- You must break any mirror sets on the boot or system partition before
  upgrading.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
