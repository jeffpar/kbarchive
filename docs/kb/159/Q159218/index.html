IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

Files may not be properly restored with a backup program (such as Windows NT
Backup).

CAUSE
=====

This problem can be caused by either of the following:

- Corrupt file

  Some third-party backup programs set the following value to 1 during setup
  while Windows NT Backup sets this value to 0:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Ntbackup\Backup Engine\Backup files
  inuse

  Open files are generally in an inconsistent state and any attempt to back up
  these files may cause corruption (for example, WINS and DHCP databases).

- Missing file

  If the value above is set to 0, the backup program skips open files;
  therefore, some files may be missing when you restore from backup.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Perform one of the following to resolve this problem:

- Set the following value to 0:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Ntbackup\Backup Engine\Backup files
  inuse

- Make sure a consistent file is available for backup before you start the
  backup. To do this, perform one of the following:

   - Application method
     Use a utility for that application file that creates a good backup while
     that file is open. For example, "rdisk -s" (without the quotation marks)
     backs up the registry in the %SystemRoot%\Repair folder.

     NOTE: When performing a remote backup of any server's registry, you must
     run "rdisk -s" (without the quotation marks) or "rdisk /s-" (without the
     quotation marks) on that server first because remote registries are not
     available to be backed up over the network.

   - System method
     Close the files before backup (for example, stop logons, close current
     sessions with existing clients, and stop all non-essential services). You
     may be able to accomplish this by using the AT command or the Command
     Scheduler (Winat.exe).

   - Application and System method
     The best approach may be to use both methods to make sure all data is
     accessible from a backup and to test your plan fully before implementing
     it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the following value is 1, backup programs attempt to back up open files:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Ntbackup\Backup Engine\Backup files
  inuse

Additional query words: scheduler sbs backup
