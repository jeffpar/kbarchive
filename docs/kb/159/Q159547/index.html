This article describes how to retrieve settings from Word dialog boxes using the
Microsoft Word Visual Basic for Applications Object Library references and the
GetObject function for OLE Automation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without warranty
either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied
warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular purpose. This
article assumes that you are familiar with the programming language being
demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug procedures. Microsoft
support professionals can help explain the functionality of a particular
procedure, but they will not modify these examples to provide added
functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific needs. If you have
limited programming experience, you may want to contact a Microsoft Certified
Partner or the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more

To use the following Visual Basic for Applications example, add the Microsoft
Word 8.0 Object Library as an available reference.

To add Microsoft Word 8.0 Object Library in Microsoft Excel 97, follow these
steps:

1. In the Visual Basic Editor, click References on the Tools menu to display the
  References dialog box.

  The References dialog box displays all object libraries and projects that are
  registered with the operating system.

2. Under Available References, click to select the Microsoft Word 8.0 Object
  Library check box.

3. Click OK.

The following example obtains the right indent of the current active document.

     Sub GetWordDocIndentSetting()
        Dim wobj As Word.Application
        Dim myDialog As Object
        On Error GoTo ObjErr
        Set wobj = GetObject("", "Word.Application")
        If wobj.Documents.Count = 0 Then
           wobj.Documents.Add
        End If
        Set myDialog = wobj.Dialogs(wdDialogFormatParagraph)
        MsgBox "Right indent = " &amp; myDialog.RightIndent
     ObjErr:
        wobj.Quit
        Set wobj = Nothing
        Set myDialog = Nothing
     End Sub

NOTE: When you use the Microsoft Word 8.0 Object Library as a reference, you can
specify Word constants by name. To obtain a Word constant, you can use the
Object Browser.

The Object Browser enables you to browse through all available objects in your
project and see their properties, methods, and events. In addition, you can see
the procedures and constants that are available from object libraries in your
project. You can easily display Help as you browse. You can use the Object
Browser to find and use objects you create, as well as objects from other
programs.

For more information about the Object Browser, from the Visual Basic Editor,
click the Office Assistant, type "Object Browser" (without the quotation marks),
click Search, and then click to view "Object Browser."

For more information about Built-in dialog box arguments, from the Visual Basic
Editor, click the Office Assistant, type "Built-in dialog box argument lists"
(without the quotation marks), click Search, and then click to view "Built-in
dialog box argument lists."

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If the Assistant is not able to answer your query, please see
