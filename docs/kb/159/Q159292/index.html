SYMPTOMS
========

After you migrate an X.400 Microsoft Mail Personal Address Book (PAB) entry that
contains a dollar sign ($)in the DDA value field and then try to send a message
to this address in the Microsoft Exchange client, the message may not be
delivered. Something similar to the following is returned to the originator:

  From: System Administrator
  Sent: Tuesday, November 5, 1996 12:16 PM
  Subject: Undeliverable: test using migrated PAB address

  Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

  Subject:test using migrated PAB address
  Sent:11/5/96 12:16:08 PM

  The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

  'X.400' on 11/5/96 12:16:12 PM
  The message was undelivered because the specified recipient postal address was
  incorrect
  MSEXCH:MSExchangeIS:SITE:SERVER

CAUSE
=====

A dollar sign, which was used in Microsoft Mail to signify that the preceding
character should not be treated as a delimiter, is not a valid character to be
used in a DDA value, according to the CCITT (ITU) X.400 specifications (see More
Information for more details). The preliminary check of the address by the
Microsoft Exchange Information Store correctly uncovers the invalid character
and returns the message to the originator as undeliverable.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

- Remove the dollar sign from all DDA values in the PAB before performing the
  migration.

  -or-

- Edit the PAB in the Microsoft Exchange client after the migration process is
  complete and remove the dollar sign.

MORE INFORMATION
================

During the migration process, when the dollar sign is encountered it is replaced
with a forward slash mark or solidus (/). For example, an address that had the
following format in Microsoft Mail

  /c=us/admd=attmail/dda.type=id/dda.value=fax(b)7135466286($/User One)

is migrated as follows into the Microsoft Exchange client PAB:

  /c=us/admd=attmail/dda.type=id/dda.value=fax(b)7135466286(//Pete Petree)

NOTE: The Microsoft Exchange Information Store treats a single forward slash mark
in a DDA value as delimiter; therefore, a double forward slash needs to be used
to send the message. Please see the following for more information:

  Q159291 XADM: Single Forward Slash Treated as Delimiter in DDA Value

The CCITT (ITU) 1988 Blue Book X.208, Table 5 defines the Printable Character set
as follows:

  Capital letters A, .. Z
  Small letters a, .. z
  Digits 0, .. 9
  Space
  Apostrophe '
  Left paren(
  Right paren )
  Plus sign+
  Comma ,
  Hyphen -
  Full stop .
  Solidus / 
  Colon :
  Equal sign =
  Question mark ?

A DDA value field can only contain a printable string.
