-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The English version of Microsoft Exchange Server can support non-English
Microsoft Exchange Clients.

To see details on mailboxes, custom recipients, or distribution lists from a
non-English client, the corresponding details templates in the same language as
the client need to be installed on the computer running Exchange Server. This
article describes how to add the localized templates to Microsoft Exchange
Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0
--------------------------------------

The location of the Template.csv file is on the Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 4.0 compact disk. This location will vary depending on the platform and
language needed. The directory structure of the compact disk is as follows:

  \SETUP
     \ALPHA
        \TPL
           \FRN
           \GER
           \JPN
           \USA
     \I386
        \TPL
           \FRN
           \GER
           \JPN
           \USA
     \MIPS
        \TPL
           \FRN
           \GER
           \JPN
           \USA
     \PPC
        \TPL
           \FRN
           \GER
           \JPN
           \USA

Select the platform type; Alpha, I386, or MIPS. Under this directory, change to
the TPL directory. Under the TPL directory, you will have the choice of FRN,
GER, JPN, and USA. Within these subdirectories you will find a file called
Template.csv in each directory.

Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 and 5.5
----------------------------------------------

In Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0 and 5.5, the location of the
Template.csv files changed. These files are now located on the Client compact
disk that comes with the Microsoft Exchange Server. The exact location of the
Template.csv file will vary, depending on the language of the clients, but
should be located in a location similar to this:

  \ENG
     \SUPPORT
        \TPL
  \FRN
     \SUPPORT
        \TPL

The files are also available on the Exchange 5.5 SP3 CDROM under the path
Drive:\Client\Template.

The Template.csv file is located in the TPL subdirectory. If the language needed
is not on the Client compact that came with the Microsoft Exchange Server, it
will be located on the Client compact disk that has the appropriate language of
the client.

Steps to Import the Template.csv
--------------------------------

To import the localized templates, from the Microsoft Exchange Administrator
program select the Directory Import command from the Tools menu. This should
bring up the Directory Import dialog. Select the Template.csv file described
above as the Import File and click OK.

This should import all the required templates. After the import has completed,
from the Administrator program the localized templates should be visible under
Addressing, Details Templates and Addressing, One-Off Address Templates.

The localized clients should now be able to bring up details on mailboxes, custom
recipients, or distribution lists.

Users of non-English clients should now be able to bring up details on mailboxes,
custom recipients, or distribution lists.
