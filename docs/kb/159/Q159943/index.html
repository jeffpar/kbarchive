SUMMARY
=======

This article answers the most frequently asked questions about the bullets and
numbering feature in Word 97.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Q. How do I create numbered headings in Word 97 that are suitable for
  technical or legal documents?

  A. You can automatically add numbers to the headings in a technical or legal
  document with the numbering format you choose by using the built-in heading
  styles. To do this, follow these steps:

  If you use the built-in heading styles to format headings in a document, you
  can automatically number headings with the numbering format you choose.

  a. On the Format menu, click Bullets and Numbering, and then click the
     Outline Numbered tab.

  b. Click a number format that contains the text "Heading 1," "Heading 2," and
     so on.

  If you do not want to use built-in heading styles, you can still add numbers
  to the headings by using the following steps to link each heading to a
  numbered format:

  a. Make sure that the headings in the document are formatted with custom
     styles.

  b. On the Format menu, click "Bullets and Numbering", and then click the
     Outline Numbered tab.

  c. Click a number format.

  d. Click Customize.

  e. In the Level box or the Preview box, click the heading level that you want
     to number.

     For example, if you want to number the top-level heading style which you've
     named "My Style 1" in your document, click 1 in the Level box.

  f. Click More.

  g. In the "Link level to style" box, click the style that corresponds to the
     level you selected in step e.

     For example, if you clicked 1 in the Level box, click "My Style 1".

  h. Repeat steps e through g for each heading style in the document.

2. Q. How do I restart or interrupt the automatic numbering sequence in the
  middle of a list?

  A. You can restart the automatic numbering as follows:

  a. On the Format menu, click "Bullets and Numbering".

  b. Under List Numbers, select the Restart Numbering option.

  NOTE: You can also set the numbering sequence to start at a specific number by
  clicking Customize and changing the Start At under Number Format to be a
  specific number. Word will automatically continue the sequence from the
  number you inserted.

3. Q. How do I get Word to continue a numbered list that is interrupted by
  non-numbered text?

  A. You can get Word to continue a numbered list as follows:

  a. On the Format menu, click "Bullets and Numbering".

  b. Click the numbering style that you used in the list that you want to
     continue.

  c. Under List Numbers, select the Continue Previous List option.

4. Q. How do I make Word recognize and help me create a multi-level list that
  mixes numbers and letters?

  A. Word refers to multi-level lists as outline numbered lists and recognizes
  seven pre-defined list formats. To apply one of the pre-defined formats, do
  the following:

  a. On the Format menu, click "Bullets and Numbering".

  b. Click the Outline Numbered tab.

  c. Click the list format that you want to use, and then click OK.

  To create a custom format, use the following steps:

  a. On the Format menu, click Bullets and Numbering, and then click the
     Outline Numbered tab.

  b. Click Customize.

  c. Click the level that you want to modify in the Level box or the Preview
     box, and then change the formats for that level.

  Repeat steps a-c for each level you want to modify.

5. Q. How do I number items in an outline level list or include more than one
  numbering level on a single line?

  A. In an outline numbered list, you can use the LISTNUM field to number items
  or to include more than one numbering level on a single line.

  For example, if the list item is "1. a)," you can use the LISTNUM field to
  automatically insert "a)," "b)," and any subsequent items on the same
  numbering level. To insert a LISTNUM field, do the following:

  a. On the Insert menu, click Field.

  b. In the Categories box, double-click Numbering.

  c. In the "Field names" box, double-click ListNum.

  d. Type the text for the list item, and then press ENTER.

  e. To insert the next number at the same level, for example (ii), repeat
     steps a through d.

6. Q. How do I reapply Outline Numbering to a document after the numbering has
  been removed?

  A. When you apply Outline Numbering to a document, remove the numbering format
  from all the paragraphs, and then reapply the format, Word reapplies Outline
  Numbering only to the paragraph that contains the insertion point. To reset
  paragraph formatting and reapply outline numbering, follow these steps in the
  order in which they are presented.

Reset Paragraph Formatting
--------------------------

  1. Select the paragraphs from which you removed the Outline Numbering format.

  2. Press CTRL+Q.

     NOTE: If you use List Styles, this step resets the paragraph formatting for
     the selected paragraphs to the default formatting and reapplies the
     Numbering format.

Select the Paragraphs and Reapply Outline Numbering
---------------------------------------------------

  1. Select the paragraphs from which you removed the Outline Numbering format.

  2. On the Format menu, click "Bullets and Numbering".

  3. Click the Outline Numbered tab, select an Outline Numbering format, and
     then click OK.
