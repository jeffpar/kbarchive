MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows for Workgroups
-------------------------------------------

The Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows for Workgroups (WFWTCP.EXE) includes the NDIS 2
protocol stack to support connecting computers running Windows for Workgroups
together or computers running Windows for Workgroups to Windows NT and Windows
NT Advanced Server using the TCP/IP protocol. Microsoft TCP/IP for Windows for
Workgroups does not include any TCP/IP utilities; however, support for the
Windows Sockets Interface is provided, which allows any Windows
Sockets-compatible TCP/IP utility (including terminal emulators and file
transfer software) to be used.

NOTE: See the READTCP!.TXT file for initial installation instructions and the
included MSTCPIP.HLP file for detailed installation instructions with Windows
for Workgroups 3.11.

Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups
----------------------------------------------

The Microsoft TCP/IP-32 version 3.11b (TCP32B.EXE) is the latest update to the
TCP/IP-32 stack for Windows for Workgroups 3.11. It has been updated since
version 3.11a and includes a number of fixes, primarily to provide compatibility
with several third-party WinSock applications, and to correct problems with
using DNS to resolve NetBIOS names. This also has updated code related to
Windows 95. This update is a complete refresh of TCP/IP-32 (WFWT32.EXE) and
contains all components of the product.

This product is compatible with and supported exclusively on Windows for
Workgroups version 3.11. If you are running a different TCP/IP product on your
computer, you must remove it before installing Microsoft TCP/IP-32. For
information on this TCP/IP-32 Update, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q122544 UPDATE.TXT: TCP/IP-32 3.11b for Windows for Workgroups


Microsoft Data Link Control (DLC) Protocol for Windows for Workgroups
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Data Link Control (DLC) Protocol for Windows for Workgroups
(WFWDLC.EXE) includes the NDIS 2 protocol stack that allows computers running
Windows for Workgroups to operate in IBM SNA environments and to connect to
mainframes and minicomputers, such as the AS/400. The DLC interface is most
commonly used by 3270 terminal emulators to communicate to IBM mainframes.
Support of these emulators is the main role of the Microsoft DLC protocol.
Products from companies such as DCA, Attachmate, IBM, Microcom, and Wall Data
support the Microsoft DLC protocol.

NOTE: See the READDLC!.TXT file for initial installation instructions and the
included MSDLC.HLP file for detailed installation instructions with Windows for
Workgroups 3.11.
