-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.1d 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Mail Network Administrator version 3.1d of Mail for AppleTalk
Networks to insert gateway recipients into a server, one or all of the following
error messages may appear:

  An error occurred while processing the following line:
  &lt;gateway recipient address&gt;
  Too few fields

  An error occurred while processing the following line:
  &lt;gateway recipient address&gt;
  Gateway recipient does not exist

Normally, if the wrong format was used, the following error message would
appear:

  An error occurred while processing the following line:
  &lt;gateway recipient address&gt;
  Wrong format chosen for input

CAUSE
=====

You can choose an input type of Changes Only or Full User List when inserting
gateway recipients from a text file. Changes Only requires an additional
parameter be placed at the beginning of each user record indicating the action
to be taken. Valid parameters include the following:

  Parameter     Description
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  Add or A      Add the user into the gateway recipient list.

  Change or C   Change address information based on the user
                friendly names.

                NOTE: It is not possible to change the user
                friendly names with this command.

  Delete or D   Remove the user from the gateway recipient list.

For example, if you want to add Joe Smith to the AppleLinkID gateway address
using Changes Only, you would enter the following text:

  " A,Joe Smith,AppleLinkID " (without the quotation marks)

If you use Full User List, the import routine expects to see only information
pertaining to the user. It assumes all users listed within the text data file
are to be added.

If the input type has been incorrectly specified, the gateway input will not be
able to correctly read the input text file as the number of fields expected will
not match the number of fields provided.

If you use Full User List and an input text file which contains Add, Change, or
Delete fields before the user field information, there will be one too many
fields. Therefore the import procedure will fail.

If you use Changes Only and an input text file which does not contain Add,
Change, or Delete fields before the user field information, there will be one
too few fields. Therefore the import procedure will fail.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this situation, ensure that you specify the correct input type when
importing user names.

Changes Only import text files always have one additional field at the beginning
of each user name containing an action to be performed such as ADD, CHANGE, or
DELETE (A, C, or D).

Full User List import text files always have the exact number of fields listed in
the Extract GW Format output file. There will be no action fields before user
name data.
