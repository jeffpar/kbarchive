SYMPTOMS
========

The left part of a TrueType character such as an italic "f" is clipped.

CAUSE
=====

There is a bug in the TextOut() and ExtTextOut() functions that occurs with
complex clipping regions. In this case, GDI considers the left edge of the
string to be the X coordinate used in the TextOut() or ExtTextOut() call. This
works for bitmap fonts, but not TrueType fonts because the "A" part of a
TrueType font's ABC width may be negative (as it normally is with an italic
"f").

Because this problem only occurs with complex clipping regions, the character may
appear to be randomly clipped as the clipping region changes. For example,
clipping may be tied to the presence of a dialog box or other window over the
client area, because that may create a complex clipping region.


RESOLUTION
==========

An application can correct this problem by calling ExtTextOut() and passing in a
clipping rectangle that accounts for the portion of the text going to the left
of the starting point.

For example, in the following call, the string origin is offset within the
clipping rectangle so the string will not be clipped:

     ExtTextOut(hdc, rc.left+10, // text origin (offset by 10 into cliprect)
                rc.top, ETO_CLIPPED,
                &amp;rc, "ffff", 4, NULL);

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in Windows version 3.1.

This problem does not occur in Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

This problem can be reproduced in Windows Write as follows:

1. Start Write.

2. Switch to the Times New Roman Italic font in a 72 point size and type an "f".

3. Display Write's About box and move it off of the "f". When the window is
  repainted, the left serif of the "f" will be clipped.
