- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

The Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Point-to-Point Server updates the Remote Access
files currently shipping with Windows for Workgroups 3.11. The Point- to-Point
Server enables a Windows for Workgroups 3.11 system to accept incoming calls
from other Remote Access clients (such as those currently included with Windows
for Workgroups 3.11). This allows anyone with the necessary password to access a
computer's shared resources from any remote PC.

You can obtain this Application Note from the following sources:

- Microsoft's World Wide Web Site on the Internet

- The Internet (Microsoft anonymous ftp server)

- Microsoft Product Support Services

For more information, see the "To Obtain This Update" section at the end of this
article. If you don't have a modem, you can obtain this update from the
Microsoft Sales Information Center (MSIC) by calling (800) 426-9400 and asking
for part number 261-050-010.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Point-to-Point Server enables remote users to
gain access only to the resources shared on the local machine. If remote users
need access to all shared network resources (such as shared files and printers
located elsewhere on the network), the computer answering the incoming calls
must be running Microsoft Windows NT, Windows NT Advanced Server, or Microsoft
LAN Manager in addition to Remote Access Service. This ensures that greater
security is available before entire network access is granted.

Installing Windows for Workgroups 3.11 Point-to-Point Server
------------------------------------------------------------

Refer to the README.TXT file provided for installation instructions and release
note information.

Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11, Windows 3.1 with built- in
