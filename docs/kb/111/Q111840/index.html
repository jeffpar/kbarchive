-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Incoming Mail
-------------

The Microsoft Mail SMTP Gateway needs to receive mail with an address that can be
associated with a single postoffice in order to route mail to the appropriate
postoffice. If you have more than one postoffice, the gateway needs to receive
addresses with different domain names and at least one unique name per
postoffice.

Most companies like to be able to give addresses as USER@COMPANY.COM instead of
USER@PO.COMPANY.COM. This means that another process has to change the address
from USER@COMPANY.COM to USER@PO.COMPANY.COM before the mail gets to the SMTP
gateway. This is usually resolved by having an alias file (one record per user)
or .FORWARD files for each user on some TCP/IP host that routes mail before it
gets to the SMTP gateway. The alias file or .FORWARD file changes the address
from USER@COMPANY.COM to USER@PO.COMPANY.COM before the mail gets to the SMTP
gateway. Consult the administrator of the Mail Routing Host for details on
accomplishing this.

Outgoing Mail
-------------

The SMTP gateway can be configured to send outgoing mail with the "from" field
address USER@COMPANY.COM. In the Mail Administrator program, select Gateway,
SMTP, Address Map, Create. Then create an additional address map for each
postoffice. In this second entry, type COMPANY.COM in the SMTP Domain field. Now
each postoffice has two address map entries. It is important that in each case
the first entry is the company domain name, COMPANY.COM. When the gateway
processes outgoing mail, it finds the first occurrence of Network/PO, and uses
that SMTP domain name, which in this case is COMPANY.COM. When incoming mail
arrives, the gateway finds the first occurrence of PO.COMPANY.COM, and sends it
to the appropriate Network/PO.

The file being changed by the Mail Administrator program is M:\SMTP\ADDR_MAP.CFG.
This file can also be edited at the MS-DOS command prompt to ensure the entries
are in the correct order.
