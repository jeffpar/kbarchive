The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Multimedia Viewer Publishing Toolkit, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Multimedia Viewer version 2.0 provides only two commands to access
the keywords defined for a title; they are the Viewer commands
JumpKeyword(Title,Keyword) and KeyIndex(). JumpKeyword() is used to jump to the
topic containing the specified keyword from the main keyword index. There is no
command available for jumping to a topic by specifying a keyword from a
secondary keyword index. KeyIndex() is used to display the Keyword Index dialog
box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is possible to get a list of the keywords defined in a title, but because the
commands using keywords are so limited, there aren't many uses for the keyword
list. Keywords are stored as word wheels in the Viewer title. Word wheels for
keywords are named using the convention |C, where C is the identification
character specified in the "key=" entry in the KEYINDEX section of the project
file. The main (default) keyword index is named |0. The WordWheel APIs
(application programming interfaces) in Viewer can be used to retrieve the
contents of the keyword word wheel. Note that the WordWheelOpen() function
always capitalizes the word wheel name, so it can be used only to open keyword
word wheels whose identification character is a capital letter or a number. See
pages 9-26 through 9-28 of the Microsoft Multimedia Viewer version 2.0
"Technical Reference" for more information on the WordWheel APIs.

Viewer does not provide a way to obtain a list of keywords defined for a topic.
It also does not provide a way to obtain a list of what topics contain a given
keyword.

Because of this, it is not possible to write a full-featured custom Keyword Index
dialog box. Neither is it possible to add keyword searches to a custom search
dialog box.

To provide a customized interface to the keywords in a title, aliases can be used
to simulate keywords. Page 8-15 through 8-20 of the Microsoft Multimedia Viewer
version 2.0 "Authoring Guide" has more information on using aliases. An alias is
used to provide alternate text that does not appear in the topic text, but that
can be used in searches. To use aliases to simulate keywords, you could define a
unique search field number for keywords. Then use this search field number, and
the search data type 0 (words) to define the "keyword" aliases. To do "keyword"
searches, use the TopicListFromQuery Viewer function, and limit the searches to
the search field defined to be "keywords" (see the documentation for the VFLD
operator on page 9-18 of the Microsoft Multimedia Viewer version 2.0 "Technical
Reference"). Chapter 9 of the "Technical Reference" documents the
TopicListFromQuery() function, as well as the other search functions. Chapter 8
describes how to write a custom search interface using the search functions, and
the KATASRCH sample shipped with Viewer PTK has sample code for a custom search
interface.

Additional query words: 2.00 key word
