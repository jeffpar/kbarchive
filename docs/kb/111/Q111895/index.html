   - Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message using the Routing form included with Electronics Form
Designer, the serialized routing of the file may not be completed. This occurs
if one of the recipients in the Routing form is not an E-form client. This can
include MS-DOS, Macintosh, and Windows clients that do not have the E-form
software installed.

CAUSE
=====

In the Routing form message, the routing information is stored in an MEF package
and can only be read and interpreted by an E-form client. Mail clients that do
not have the E-form software installed receive a text-only version of the
message and can not access the MEF package (MEFPKG.DAT). Since the next
recipient in the routing list cannot be determined, the routing cycle is
terminated.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 1.0 of Electronic Forms
Designer. We are researching this problem and will post new information in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
