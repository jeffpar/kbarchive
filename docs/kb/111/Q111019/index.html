SUMMARY
=======

When you install a network adapter card, sound card, or other hardware adapter,
you typically have to choose an input/output (I/O) base address. If the base
address you choose for your network adapter card is currently being used by
another hardware adapter card, Protocol Manager may report an unsuccessful
binding, or your system may stop responding (hang).

This article provides a list of I/O base addresses that may already be in use on
your system and what hardware devices use them.

NOTE: Most network adapter cards have the default I/O base address 300.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The I/O base address for each hardware adapter card installed on your system
must be unique to avoid potential problems. Before you install your network
adapter card, you should know which I/O base addresses are currently in use by
existing hardware adapter cards installed in your system. I/O base addresses are
typically set using jumpers on the card or using a software configuration
program in EPROM.

The following list shows I/O base address ranges commonly used by hardware
devices (other than network adapter cards) and what I/O base address they would
conflict with.

The I/O base address list does not list all available I/O base address. In
addition, some of these addresses may not be supported by your network adapter
card. For more information on I/O base addresses supported by your network
adapter card, consult your hardware documentation or contact the network adapter
card vendor.

Potential conflicting devices and their I/O base addresses:

                                                     Potential I/O Base
  Device                              Range Used       Address Conflict

NOTE: Some video cards use I/O base address 320. If you are using I/O base
address 320 for your network adapter card and are experiencing problems, try a
different I/O base address.

* These addresses are for older PS/2 computers. ISA computers use the following
address ranges:

    Device   Range Used
    -------------------
    LPT1:    378-37F
    LPT2:    278-27F
    LPT3:    3BC-3BF
