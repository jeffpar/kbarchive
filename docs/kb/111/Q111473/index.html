-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b, 6.1, 6.1a, 6.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A STRUCT declaration containing an ORG directive will change the current segment
size when the -Sf switch is used and a listing file is produced with MASM 6.x.

CAUSE
=====

When adding a first-pass listing (the -Sf switch) to the listing file, MASM's
internal location counter is affected when the ORG directive is encountered
within a STRUCT declaration. This location counter is ultimately used to
determine segment size.

RESOLUTION
==========

When declaring a STRUCT that contains an ORG directive, place the declaration
outside of any open segments. Because this is a structure declaration rather
than an actual instance, the structure does not have to be within a segment and
can be placed outside all open segments where the location counter will not be
adversely affected.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Macro Assembler
(MASM) versions 6.x. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following sample code illustrates this problem. When the structure is
declared within the open data segment, the size of the data segment is
increased. This can be viewed in the map file for the sample, as well as in the
listing file. Move the structure declaration before the .DATA and .STACK
directives to obtain the expected behavior.

An ORG directive is permitted in a structure declaration beginning with MASM
version 6.0. This enables the generation of a template that can ease references
to the internals of data structures that are predefined, for instance by the
operating system, the operating platform, or a high-level language compiler.

For additional information about this MASM construct as well as sample code
demonstrating its use, please see the following article(s) in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
