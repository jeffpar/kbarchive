SYMPTOMS
========

While running a Compaq ProLiant using the NetFlex-3 network adapter, all network
connectivity is intermittently lost.

-or-

When checking the properties of the NetFlex-3 adapter, a "Wire Fault" error is
received.

CAUSE
=====

These errors may occur if you are using a NetFlex-3 card with the 100 UTP module
attached, and the following is true:

The module is set at 100 megabits per second and the first device encountered,
such as a hub, can only handle 10 megabits per second, or if the module is
defective and not properly autodetecting the inability of that first device to
handle the 100 megabits per second speed.

-or-

It may be a Token Ring module being used on Ethernet, or the other way around.
However, this could only apply if the computer were brand new, or just had
service work such as replacing the motherboard. If the computer had been
operating properly, the cause would probably be the above choice.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

- Obtain the updated driver for the NetFlex-3 PCI card in Softpack SP3206 from
  Compaq

- Remove the module, which is located on the motherboard, plugged into the top
  of the NetFlex-3. Restart the computer. This will allow the computer to
  revert to its default setting of 10 megabits per second. After the computer
  restarts, network connectivity should be restored.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem may occur if the computer uses the NetFlex-3 card with a 100 UTP
module attached on an Ethernet network. By default, this module is set to
autodetect between 10 megabits per second and 100 megabits per second. With the
autodetect setting, the module is supposed to attempt to send at 100 megabits
per second, and, if the first device encountered (for example, a hub) cannot
handle that speed, it will then revert to sending at 10 megabits per second.

Pinging the adapter may be successful, and Compaq diagnostic utilities may still
show a successful connection with the hub.

Reinstalling the NetFlex-3 will show light activity at the hub, but still no
network connectivity. If the computer is then restarted, all hub light activity
will cease.

The "Wire Frame" error is a Token Ring error, even though this may be an Ethernet
card. If the network wire is plugged into another computer, it works fine.

The 100 UTP module is set to autodetect by default on an Ethernet network. To set
this to either 100 megabits per second or 10 megabits per second only, you must
configure through CMOS.

For a Token Ring module, the settings must be configured in CMOS for the 4/16
speeds.
