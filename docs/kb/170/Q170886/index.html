-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set the text language to French (Standard) in Microsoft Word 97 and
type a sentence with a single quotation mark enclosed in double quotation marks,
the single quotation mark will incorrectly be formatted as a double quotation
mark.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 1 (SR- 1).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
This problem was corrected in Microsoft Word 97 SR-1.

For additional information about SR-1, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q172475 OFF97: How to Obtain and Install MS Office 97 SR-1

MORE INFORMATION
================

In French, quotations are set off with chevrons (which resemble greater than and
less than symbols). For example, this sentence in English

  "This is a sentence enclosed in quotation marks."

is written like this in French:

  &lt;&lt; This is a sentence enclosed in quotation marks. &gt;&gt;

Microsoft Word uses the AutoFormat feature to convert double quotation marks (")
to the French quotation marks (&lt;&lt; or &gt;&gt;) when the language property
for the text is set to French (on the Tools menu, click Language).

If you want to have a single quotation mark enclosed within standard quotation
marks, the single quotation mark is changed to a double quotation mark. This
behavior is incorrect. The single quotation mark should remain as is. For
example, this English statement

  "l'arbre" et l'avion

is changed to this if French is selected as the language:

  &lt;&lt; l"arbre &gt;&gt; et l'avion

The correct behavior would produce the following results:

  &lt;&lt; l'arbre &gt;&gt; et l'avion

To format text for French, follow these steps:

1. Select the text you want to format for French.

2. On the Tools menu, point to Language, and click Set Language.

3. Change the language to French (Standard) and then click OK.
