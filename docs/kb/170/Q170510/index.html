SYMPTOMS
========

Double-clicking the mouse in your application behaves as if you clicked the
mouse button once. This behavior has been observed in the following applications
running in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3:

- Microsoft Visio Professional 4.x

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 adds a code path where mouse movement does not
update the timestamp for a WM_MOUSEMOVE event. This behavior can potentially
occur with any application that relies on WM_MOUSEMOVE timestamps. For example,
Visio uses a custom event handler to detect double-clicks rather than checking
for the WM_LBUTTONDBLCLK message.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack
