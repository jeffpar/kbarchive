-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a document in Microsoft Word 97 using the Fax Wizard, and the
document contains extended characters, when the document is faxed, the extended
characters may be displayed incorrectly.

For example, the extended characters may overlap each other, or the character
spacing may be incorrect.

NOTE: The document is printed correctly; the error only occurs when the document
is faxed.

CAUSE
=====

This error is caused by a problem with the fax print driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 1 (SR- 1).

If you are unable to update to SR-1, use the following workaround.


WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And Values
online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should make a
backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you edit the
registry.

To set a print flag for the fax driver that will correct this problem, follow
these steps:

1. Click the Start menu, and then click Run.

2. In the Run box, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks) and then click
  OK.

3. Locate the following registry entry:

     HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word

  If an entry exists named Microsoft Fax, skip to step 6.

4. With the Word entry selected, on the Edit menu, point to New, and click Key.

5. Type "Microsoft Fax" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER.

6. With the Microsoft Fax entry selected, on the Edit menu, point to New, and
  click String Value.

7. On the right, type "Flags" (without the quotation marks), and press ENTER.

8. With Flags selected, on the Edit menu, click Modify.

9. In the Value Data box, type in "8192" (without the quotation marks) and click
  OK.

The extended characters should now be displayed correctly on the fax.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
This problem was corrected in Microsoft Word 97 SR-1.

For additional information about SR-1, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
