The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, version Service Release 1 (SR-1) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This article discusses a change in the Float Over Text feature when inserting
pictures or objects in Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 1.

How Floating Objects Behave in Pre-Service Release Word 97
----------------------------------------------------------

In Microsoft Word 97, when you insert a picture or an object, by default, the
picture or object is inserted as floating object. That is, the Float Over Text
check box is always enabled.

In addition, if you click to clear the Float Over Text check box, the check box
is reset each time you insert a new picture or object. That is, the setting you
choose is not retained. You must clear the check box each time you insert an
object or picture.

How Floating Objects Behave in Word 97, Service Release 1.
----------------------------------------------------------

In Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 1, when you insert a picture or object, it
is inserted as an inline (non-floating) object. That is, the Float Over Text
check box is cleared by default.

In addition, if you click to select the Float Over Text check box, Word will
retain your setting. That is, the option will be set until you change it again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This change in behavior does not apply when you cut or copy and then paste a
picture or object. In this situation, the picture or object will always be
pasted as a floating object.

To see the Float Over Text check box, do any of the following:

- On the Insert menu, click Object.

  -or-

- On the Insert menu, point to Picture, and click From File.

  -or-

- On the Edit menu, click Paste Special.

NOTE: If you insert clip art in your document by clicking Picture on the Insert
menu and selecting the Clip Art option, the clip art will always be inserted as
a floating object, even if the Float Over Text check box is cleared in these
locations.
