SYMPTOMS
========

Your attempts to connect to a remote router are unsuccessful. In the event log
of one the routers you get the following error. The error may be logged on the
router making or receiving the call:

  Event: 20050
  Source: Router
  Description: The user &lt;domain\username&gt; connected to port
  &lt;portname&gt; has been disconnected because the computer could not be
  projected onto the network.

The Rasipcp.log file on this computer shows information similar to the
following:

  [158] 10:23:03: IPCP: ReconfigureTcpip(04878585 / ffffffff)...
  [158] 10:23:03: IPCP: ReconfigureTcpip done(1214)
  [158] 10:23:03: IPCP: ReconfigureTcpip=1214

The Ppp.log file on this computer will have the following error message:

  [158] 10:23:03:071: Notifying IPCP of projection notification
  [158] 10:23:03:071: RasIPCPProjectionNotification returned 1214

The logs on the other router do not indicate any errors.


CAUSE
=====

This error is caused by one of the routers requesting a bad IP address. In this
case, the router is requesting an address of 133.133.135.4 and the routers are
using a subnet mask of 255.255.255.252. Using a mask of 252 results in the
following configuration:

133.133.135.4 - Network ID
133.133.135.5 - First Host ID
133.133.135.6 - Second Host ID
133.133.135.7 - Subnet Broadcast ID

Therefore, the IP address being requested is a Network ID and not a Host ID. The
same error will occur if the Subnet Broadcast ID (133.133.135.7) were requested.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the demand dial interface to request a valid Host Address or to use an IP
address assigned by remote router.
