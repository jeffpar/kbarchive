-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, used with:
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The example code from Help for the SelPrint method of the Microsoft Rich Text
Control causes syntax errors when saving after it is pasted into the Click
method of a command button as directed by Help. Additionally, once the syntax
errors are fixed, the contents of the Rich Text control do not print on the
Windows 95 platform but no error messages are received.

CAUSE
=====

The example code in Help for the SelPrint method of the Microsoft Rich Text
control is Visual Basic code.

Even after converting this code to Visual FoxPro code, the contents of the Rich
Text Control cannot be printed on the Windows 95 platform. The specific cause of
this behavior is under investigation.

RESOLUTION
==========

The example code for the SelPrint method can be changed into the following
Visual FoxPro code to eliminate the syntax errors and get the contents of the
Rich Text control to print when Visual FoxPro is running on the Windows NT 4.0
platform.

As stated in Help, place the following code in the Click method of a command
button. A CommonDialog control should also be placed on the form with a command
button and a Rich Text control:

  cdlPDReturnDC=256
  cdlPDNoPageNums=8
  cdlPDSelection=1
  cdlPDAllPages=0

  Thisform.CommDlg1.Flags = cdlPDReturnDC + cdlPDNoPageNums
  If Thisform.RTF1.SelLength = 0
  Thisform.CommDlg1.Flags = Thisform.CommDlg1.Flags ;
  + cdlPDAllPages
  Else
  Thisform.CommDlg1.Flags = Thisform.CommDlg1.Flags ;
  + cdlPDSelection
  EndIf
  Thisform.CommDlg1.ShowPrinter
  Thisform.RTF1.SelPrint(Thisform.CommDlg1.hDC)

Note that the above code refers to CommDlg1 and RTF1 as the names of the ActiveX
controls. When these controls are placed on a form, the names default to
"OLEControl1" and "OLEControl2." Therefore, the name property for these two
controls needs to be changed to "CommDlg1" and "RTF1," respectively, for the
above code to work properly in Visual FoxPro.

The code in this article might cause the following error if you click Cancel
instead of OK in the printer dialog box:

  OLE Idispatch Exception code 0 from richttextctrl: Invalid HDC...

NOTE: Thisform.OleControl2.hDC returns a -1 when Cancel is chosen; therefore, the
error occurs. To prevent this error, place an IF...ENDIF statement around the
last line of the Click event code as follows:

  IF Thisform.OleControl2.hDC&gt;0
     Thisform.OleControl1.SelPrint(Thisform.OleControl2.hDC)
  ENDIF

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The name and version of the Rich Text control varies depending on which version
of Visual FoxPro or Visual Basic has been installed on the computer.

Look in the Tools, Options dialog box, Controls tab in Visual FoxPro to check
which version of a control is installed. Unfortunately the dialog box displaying
the controls is not wide enough to show the version number of the Rich Text
control. The actual file version can be obtained by viewing the properties of
the .ocx file in Windows Explorer.

The Microsoft Rich Textbox Control, version 1.0.2922, is installed by Visual
FoxPro 5.0. The file name is Richtx32.ocx and is found in either the
Win95\System or the WinNT\System32 folder depending on the operating system.

The Microsoft RichText Control, version 5, version 5.00.3714, is installed by
Visual FoxPro 5.0a. It is also named Richtx32.ocx and is found in the same
locations as the version installed by Visual FoxPro 5.0.

After you click OK to print in the Print dialog box, it places that value in the
Thisform.OleControl2.hDC. This value is not reset until you close the form.
Therefore, you might see the behavior when someone clicks OK to print and then
(without closing the form) clicks Cancel. The job prints anyway because the
value has not been reset.

REFERENCES
==========

Help for the Microsoft Rich Text Control: Access this by right-clicking on the
control on the form and selecting Help from the shortcut menu. Click the Methods
jump at the top of the page and select the SelPrint Method to Display from the
Topics Found dialog box. The sample code is in the Example jump at the top of
the page.

ActiveX Controls Overview Help topic. Type "HELP ActiveX Controls Overview" in
the Visual FoxPro Command window to go directly to this topic.

For additional information about adding ActiveX controls to your applications,
see Chapter 16, "Adding OLE," in the Developer's Guide.

The values for the constants, cdlPDReturnDC, cdlPDNoPageNums, cdlPDSelection, and
cdlPDAllPages, used in the Resolution section above are from the Help file for
the Common Dialog control, Flags Property(Print Dialog) topic. Right-click the
Common Dialog control and select Help from the shortcut menu.
