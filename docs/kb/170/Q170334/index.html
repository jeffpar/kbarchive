SUMMARY
=======

This article describes steps for troubleshooting intrasite (multiple servers in
one site) directory replication for Exchange Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

First, allow enough time. Even if you have run knowledge consistency checks,
Update Now, and Request Now, directory replication can still take several hours
to fully complete.

If enough time has passed for replication to complete, use the following
procedure to help determine where the problem is.

1. Are the servers in the site in one domain or in different domains?

  If the servers are in different Windows NT domains, there may be a security or
  permissions problem. Confirm that the service account is in a domain that is
  trusted by the domain or domains into which all other servers are installed.
  This may have changed since Exchange was installed. Confirm that the trust is
  working by performing some other cross-domain operation such as printing,
  copying a file, and so on. You may even want to try breaking and
  re-establishing the trust as a test.

  If the servers are all in one Windows NT domain, then you may want to check
  whether NTFS file system is being used. If NTFS partition is used, then
  confirm that the service account has the proper permissions to access the
  Exchsrvr directory.

2. Can the servers in the site communicate properly (using PING and RPCPING)?

  If Windows NT security is not the problem, probably there is a communications
  problem. Make sure that the PING command, between the servers involved,
  successfully returns the IP address if TCP/IP is being used. Make sure to
  PING the servername, because Exchange also uses the servername when
  contacting another Exchange Server computer.

  Set up RPCPING with security to test RPC communications between the servers.
  The Exchange directory communicates directly with other directories in the
  site using RPC calls.

  If PING or RPCPING fails, then the problem is more than likely with the
  network. Check the protocols being used; the network configuration/topology
  including media, routers, bridges, and frame relays; and so on.

3. Are there any other error messages or anything in the event log?

  Check the event viewer to see whether there are any warnings or stop messages
  pertaining to replication. Also check the Microsoft Knowledge Base for
  possible information pertaining to the event ID or the description of the
  event IDs found in the event viewer.

4. Turn up the diagnostics logging for MSExchangeDS on replication to Maximum.
  This will increase the amount of information written to the event log and may
  provide information that will help to solve the problem.
