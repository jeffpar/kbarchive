The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a user chooses to print a mail message with a file attachment, the user may
optionally choose to print the attachment as well. In cases where the user
chooses to print the attachment, and the application responsible for printing
the attachment is running, the file attachment may not print properly.

The user may see a message such as this:

  Microsoft WordErr=1078
  This file could not be found.(C:\temp\document.doc)

CAUSE
=====

On computers running Windows NT 3.51, the Microsoft Exchange client calls a
Windows NT system function that is responsible for printing the file attachment
using whatever application has registered itself to handle this document (based
on the attachment's file extension).


The Microsoft Exchange client saves the document attachment in a temporary
directory and calls the Windows NT system function, passing it the path to the
document to print.

If the application necessary for printing the document is not running, the
following operations are performed by the system function:

1. The application necessary to print the document is started.

2. The application is passed information on the command-line regarding the name
  of the file to print.

3. The application is closed after printing is complete.

If the application necessary for printing the document is currently running, the
following operations are performed by the system function:

1. The system function initiates a Windows DDE conversation with the
  application.

2. The application is asked (through DDE) to open, print, and close the
  document.

After the system call is performed, the Microsoft Exchange client deletes the
temporary file created for printing the attachment.

A race condition exists where, in the latter case (using DDE), the temporary file
is deleted BEFORE the application has had an opportunity to print the document,
which usually results in the application complaining that the file is missing.

WORKAROUND
==========

Close the application(s) that will be used to print the file attachments before
beginning the print operation.
