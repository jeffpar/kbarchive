SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to install additional fonts that are available in the
ValuPack folder on the Microsoft Office 97 for Windows and Microsoft Word 97 for
Windows CDs.

NOTE: These fonts and the ValuPack folder are not available if you install from
the 3.5-inch disks.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you install Microsoft Office, only certain fonts are installed. If you know
that you have other fonts installed on your computer, but they do not appear on
the Font menu in Microsoft Word, check to see if the fonts are listed in the
Fonts folder in Microsoft Windows 95. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Fonts icon.

  This will bring up a Fonts folder with a list of all of the fonts that are
  installed on your computer.

If the font that you are looking for is not listed, check to see if it is on the
Microsoft Office 97 CD. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open Microsoft Explorer by right-clicking Start and then clicking Explore.

2. Place the Microsoft Office CD in the CD-ROM drive.

3. In Explorer, click the CD drive icon to read the files on the CD.

4. Double-click the ValuPack folder and then double-click the Msfonts folder.

You will now see the fonts supplied with the ValuPack. If you find the font that
you need and if you want to install it for use with any office program, do the
following:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Fonts icon.

3. On the File menu, click Install New Font.

4. In the Drives box, click the drive that contains the Microsoft Office 97 CD.

5. In the Folders box, double-click the ValuPack folder, and then double-click
  the Msfonts folder.

  It will take a moment to load the fonts.

6. Click to select the "Copy fonts to Fonts folder" check box.

7. In the List Of Fonts box, click the font you want. To select all of the
  available fonts, click Select All. To select several nonadjacent fonts, click
  the name of one font, and then hold down CTRL and click the name of each
  additional font. To select several adjacent fonts, click the name of the
  first font in the sequence, and then hold down SHIFT and click the name of
  the last font.

8. After you have selected the fonts you want to install, click the OK button.

  The fonts will now appear in the Fonts folder.

All of the fonts you installed should be available to any Office program.

You can install up to 150 additional TrueType fonts to help you create, view, and
print great looking documents. You can view a sample of each available font to
help you choose the font you want to install if you have a GIF file viewer, such
as Microsoft Photo Editor or Microsoft Internet Explorer.

For more information, see Microsoft ValuPack Help (ValuPk8.hlp) in the \ValuPack
folder on the Office 97 CD-ROM.
