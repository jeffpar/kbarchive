SYMPTOMS
========

You may see one of the following problems when you update a newly-added record
using a CRecordset derived class that uses RFX_Int:

- The value 32484 is saved in the table if the int data member was not
  modified.

- If the int data member corresponds to an identity column in the table, an
  error message appears indicating that an attempt was made to save a value to
  it. Identity fields are automatically updated by the server, and cannot be
  modified by external applications without setting flags on the server.

- Fields of type int that were not modified, and thus should contain NULL,
  contain 32484 instead. This may cause queries involving NULLs to return
  unexpected results.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by a bug in the RFX_Int function which always causes it
to mark the int data member as dirty during AddNew. This problem occurs only if
the value of the int data member was not explicitly changed.

When a record is added, all of the data members are set to pseudo null values.
The application then sets the values of any members that are to be changed.
Subsequently, any fields where the corresponding data member is not a pseudo
null are marked as dirty and an SQL statement including all of the dirty fields
is generated.

In the RFX_Int::MarkForAddNew in Visual C++ 5.0, the if clause that checks for
the pseudo null value was removed. The code in 5.0 appears as follows:

     case CFieldExchange::MarkForAddNew:
     // can force writing of psuedo-null value (as a non-null) by ...
     if (!pFX-&gt;m_prs-&gt;IsFieldStatusDirty(nField - 1))
     {
        pFX-&gt;m_prs-&gt;SetDirtyFieldStatus(nField - 1);
        pFX-&gt;m_prs-&gt;ClearNullFieldStatus(nField - 1);
     }
     return;

The effect of the change is to force the field to be set as dirty (no matter what
value it has), and write that value out to the underlying table. If the
application has not changed that value since the AddNew, then it will be
AFX_RFX_INT_PSEUDO_NULL = 32484.

RESOLUTION
==========

The resolution depends on the application. The cleanest workaround is to change
the int data member to a long, and use the RFX_Long function. The code problem
above only exists with the int type, and most of the server data types that
might be mapped to an int, such as Integer, Numeric(9), etc., will map to a long
as well. This method also creates more portable code, since the size and max
value of the int data type varies from one platform and operating system to
another.

Another solution is to create your own RFX_Int functions. To create your own
RFX_Int function, follow these steps:

1. From file vc\mfc\src\DBRFX.CPP, copy the function RFX_Int.

2. Create a new .cpp file and include the file in your project that uses ints.
  Place the copy of RFX_Int into this file and rename it RFX_Int1. Change the
  switch statement case for MarkForAddNew from the following code:

        case CFieldExchange::MarkForAddNew:
        // Can force writing of psuedo-null value (as a non-null) by
        // setting field dirty.
        if (!pFX-&gt;m_prs-&gt;IsFieldStatusDirty(nField - 1))
        {
           pFX-&gt;m_prs-&gt;SetDirtyFieldStatus(nField - 1);
           pFX-&gt;m_prs-&gt;ClearNullFieldStatus(nField - 1);
        }
        return;

  to:

        case CFieldExchange::MarkForAddNew:
        // Can force writing of psuedo-null value (as a non-null) by
        // setting field dirty.

        // comment out -&gt; if (!pFX-&gt;m_prs-&gt;IsFieldStatusDirty(nField - 1))
        if (value != AFX_RFX_INT_PSEUDO_NULL)   // add in this line
        {
           pFX-&gt;m_prs-&gt;SetDirtyFieldStatus(nField - 1);
           pFX-&gt;m_prs-&gt;ClearNullFieldStatus(nField - 1);
        }
        return;

3. Include the following header information in your new project file:

        #include "stdafx.h"

        #ifdef AFX_DB_SEG
        #pragma code_seg(AFX_DB_SEG)
        #endif

        #ifdef _DEBUG
        #undef THIS_FILE
           static char THIS_FILE[] = __FILE__;
        #endif

        #define new DEBUG_NEW

4. Create a header file that declares your new RFX_INT1 function. Include it
  into any CRecordset-derived classes that need to use small integers.

5. Change all of the calls in the DoFieldExchange functions of your
  CRecordset-derived classes from RFX_Int to RFX_Int1.
