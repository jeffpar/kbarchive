SUMMARY
=======

The following macro example allows you to designate selected text as a table of
contents entry without removing the text from the body of the document and
without having to type the table of contents entry twice.

NOTE: Microsoft Word provides a method for marking table of contents entries. To
do this, select the text that you want to mark as a table of contents entry and
press ALT+SHIFT+O. However, you can also use the macro described in this
article.

You can assign the following macro to a menu, toolbar, or key sequence to quickly
designate text to be included in a table of contents.

     Sub EnterTCField()
        Dim SelectedText As String
        ' Selection must be text.
        If Selection.Type = wdSelectionNormal Then
           ' Get selected text and place it within quotation marks.
           SelectedText = Chr$(34) &amp; Selection.Text &amp; Chr$(34)
           ' Move insertion point to end of selection.
           Selection.Collapse (wdCollapseEnd)
           ' Insert TC field.
           Selection.Fields.Add Range:=Selection.Range, _
           Type:=wdFieldTOCEntry, Text:=SelectedText
        Else
           MsgBox "The selected text is not valid for a TC field."
        End If
     End Sub

When you have designated all of the table of contents entries with this macro,
choose Table Of Contents from the Insert menu. Click Options and click to select
the Table entry fields check box.

Table of Contents entries or TC fields are automatically formatted as hidden
text. To edit these entries, you must select either Show All or Hidden Text. To
do this, do the following:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. On the View tab, click to select Field Codes.

3. Click to select the Hidden Text check box.

and then double-click the selected text to go to the "Field codes: TC (Table of
Contents Entry) field" topic. If you are unable to find the information you
need, ask the Office Assistant.

For more information about adding a command to a menu, click Contents And Index
