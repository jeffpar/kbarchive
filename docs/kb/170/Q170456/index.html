-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In some localized non-English versions of Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 and
2.1 (OSR2), there may be less conventional memory available to MS-DOS-based
programs.

In these versions, the MEM /C command may show Himem.sys occupying approximately
44K of conventional memory. In the English version of OSR2, the MEM /C command
shows Himem.sys occupying approximately 1K of conventional memory.

This issue is known to affect the following language versions of OSR2: Brazilian,
Danish, Dutch, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, and
Spanish.

CAUSE
=====

The increased conventional memory used by Himem.sys occurs because Io.sys
occupies more memory in the high memory area (HMA), forcing Himem.sys to be
relocated in conventional memory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service
Release 2 and 2.1. An update to address this problem is now available, but
should be applied only to computers experiencing this specific problem. Unless
you are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this update at this time. Contact the vendor of your OEM version of
Windows 95 for additional information about the availability of this update, or
obtain the update from the Microsoft Download Center, as described below.

This issue is resolved by the following updated files for OSR2:

  Brazilian:  Winboot.sys dated 12/31/96 (214,836 bytes)

MORE INFORMATION
================

This symptom occurs whether the computer boots from the hard disk or from an
Emergency Recovery Disk.

To resolve this issue on computers that already have the affected versions of
OSR2 installed, run the appropriate Iosys&lt;xxx&gt;.exe file to update your
OSR2 installation. This will check that your computer is running OSR2 and
replace the Io.sys file on the boot drive.

To update an existing OSR2 Emergency Recovery Disk (ERD), use the SYS A: (or SYS
B: as appropriate) command at a command prompt or in the Run dialog box. Make
sure that the ERD is not write protected.


Note that there is a fix available for Microsoft Windows 98 as well, for the
following languages:

  Finnish, Polish, and Brazilian/Portugese
