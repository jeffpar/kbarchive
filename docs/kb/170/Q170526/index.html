-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you reinstall Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0, all your
settings, profiles, and files saved to your desktop may be missing.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when you perform a full Windows NT Workstation
installation, rather than an upgrade, over an existing installation of Windows
NT Workstation.

RESOLUTION
==========

Re-create your settings and profiles in the new installation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you perform a full installation of Windows NT Workstation, all user
registry settings are removed. The full installation process assumes that there
is no Windows NT folder and therefore does not look for settings to move to the
new installation; all registry settings are rewritten. The Profiles folder is
re-created to include only the files and folders that are present in a new
installation. Because files saved to the desktop are saved in a folder in the
Profiles folder, the files are deleted. To preserve your settings, Profiles
folder, and any information contained in the Profiles folder, you must choose
the Upgrade option during Setup when you reinstall Windows NT Workstation.

The following folders may be present in the Winnt\Profiles\&lt;name&gt; folder

- Application Data

- Desktop

- Favorites

- NetHood

- Personal

- PrintHood

- Recent

- SendTo

- Start Menu

- Templates

where &lt;name&gt; is the name you use to log in to Windows NT.
