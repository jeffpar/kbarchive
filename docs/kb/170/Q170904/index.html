Text Format (RTF), the picture will become larger when you open the document in
Microsoft Word 7.x.

  4. Click OK.

Method 2: Convert the Inline Picture to a Framed Object
-------------------------------------------------------

If you have not yet saved the document from Microsoft Word 97 in Word 6.0/95 or
RTF format, you can convert the inline picture to a framed object in Microsoft
Word 97. To do this, use the following steps:
