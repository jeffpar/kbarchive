SYMPTOMS
========

Network connectivity to a computer using the Compaq NetFlex-3 network card is
intermittently lost and then restored every few minutes without having to
restart the system.

Depending on the application, the client or application may have to be restarted
to restore the connection. If the application has open files on the server, data
may be lost.

Some applications report the lost connections. Others applications may seem to
stop responding (hang) for several minutes before continuing.

On a Compaq computer running Windows NT Server version 4.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3)
and has a Compaq NetFlex3 network adapter and Compaq Support Software Disk (SSD)
version 2.04 installed, Event Viewer may record the following events:

  Event ID: 4105
  Source: CpqNF31
  Description: Network link is down. Please check your cabling. See
  documentation for more information or contact your service provider.

  Event ID: 4106
  Source: CpqNF31
  Description: Network link has been restored.

CAUSE
=====

The NetFlex-3 10/100 network PCI card is set to 100 MB/full duplex. The
NetFlex-3 driver provided with Windows NT 4.0 does not support full duplex mode
at 100 MB.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

- Obtain the updated driver for the NetFlex-3 PCI card in Softpack SP3206 from
  Compaq.

  NOTE: SP3942 was the current version as of this writing. Go to:

  http://www.compaq.com/support/files/server/softpaqs/WINNT/NTSSDNTFLX.html

For Windows NT 3.51 systems, get Compaq Softpack SP3302 (SSD 1.23A and NetFlex 3
driver version 3.06) from the following location:

  http://www.compaq.com/support/files/server/softpaqs/WINNT/NTSSDNTFLX3.html
