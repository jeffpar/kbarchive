The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
- Microsoft Windows 95

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the
"Restoring a Registry Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Service Pack 3 for Windows NT 4.0 Server, clients who try to
log on using the IPX protocol may experience problems.

Microsoft Network Clients version 3.0 for MS-DOS may display the following
error:

  Error 5: Access has been denied.

Windows for Workgroups and Windows 95 clients may report password problems. They
may display the following error message:

  The Domain password supplied is incorrect, or access to your logon server has
  been denied.

MS-DOS clients and Windows for Workgroups clients may fail every time. Windows 95
clients may only fail sporadically. NT clients will not experience a problem
because they do not use Direct Hosting to establish a session.

The Microsoft network clients 3.0 for MS-DOS may also exhibit problems
Establishing a session to a member server in the logon domain. In this case, you
may receive the following error:

  Error 58: The network has responded incorrectly

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


To work around this problem, follow the steps below.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Use the Regedt32.exe tool, and navigate to the following location:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanManServer
     \Parameters

  NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

2. Add the following value:

     Value Name: MinClientBufferSize
     Data Type: REG_DWORD
     Radix: Hex
     Data: 1F4

3. Rebooted the computer to have this change take effect.

To resolve domain validation errors, either the hotfix or the registry change
should be applied to all domain controllers running the IPX protocol.

STATUS
======

Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
