SYMPTOMS
========

When copying folders and files from one volume to another volume using a
Macintosh, the time and date stamps of the folder and files will change to the
date and time of the copy. This should not occur when doing a copy as the data
of the file has not changed.

This problem does not occur when copying files from Macintosh-accessible volumes
over the network. The problem only occurs when copying files and folders on
volumes residing on the same server.

CAUSE
=====

The problem was caused by Services for Macintosh (SFM) having multiple data
streams open on a file. Each stream has its own last modified time, and SFM had
only changed one of the stream times. Because NTFS stores a last modified time
on a per-file basis, not per-stream basis, the time that was written to the file
was not always the one that SFM had set.

This has been addressed by closing all of the data streams except one, and then
setting the time on that one stream, resulting in the time and date being set to
the last modified time, which will be the same as the original file being copied
from.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


For your convenience, the English version of this post-SP3 hotfix has been posted
to the following Internet location. However, Microsoft recommends that you
install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 to correct this problem.

NOTE: The above link is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
