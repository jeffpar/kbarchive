The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When your document contains a damaged field code and you save the document in
Rich Text Format (RTF), you may receive the following error message:

  This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down. If the
  problem persists, contact the program vendor.

When you click Details, you receive the following message:

  WINWORD caused an invalid page fault in module WINWORD.EXE.

Other possible symptoms include:

- If you click Header and Footer on the View menu, the header and footer panes
  may not be displayed.

- Field codes have only one field brace displayed instead of two.

- If you delete the text in the header or footer, Word may stop responding.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur in a variety of situations when manually editing fields
in the header including, but not limited to, some of the following actions:

- On the Standard toolbar, Show/Hide is not selected, that is, nonprinting
  characters are not displayed.

- On the View tab in the Options dialog box, the View Field Codes check box is
  cleared.

- On the Layout tab in the Page Setup dialog box, the Different First Page
  check box is cleared.

- You save, close, and then reopen the file.

- You press TAB and then press BACKSPACE in the header or footer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 1 (SR- 1).

To work around this problem, copy everything but the last paragraph to a new
document. To do this, follow these steps:


1. Open the document that contains the damaged field code.

2. Press CTRL+END to move the insertion point to the end of the document.

3. Press CTRL+SHIFT+HOME to select all but the last paragraph of the document.

4. On the Edit menu, click Copy.

5. Create a new document.

6. On the Edit menu, click Paste.

7. Re-create the header and footer for the document.
