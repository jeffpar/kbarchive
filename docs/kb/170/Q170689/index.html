Microsoft Windows 95 Help Authoring Kit, ISBN 1-55615-892-0, contains a
procedure which produces the following error when the steps on pages 18 through
29 are completed:

  Processing TOPICS\myhelp.rtf

     The RTF file TOPICS\myhelp.rtf is corrupted at offset 286.
        HC4005: Warning:
     The .\myhelp.hlp help file has not been created.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Word 97 produces a rich text file that is incompatible with Microsoft
Help Compiler 4.0. For more information on this problem, please see the
following article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q164012 Error Compiling Word 97 RTF in Help Compiler, Help WorkShop.

Microsoft is aware of this problem and has produced a new version of the
Microsoft Help Compiler that will work correctly with Microsoft Word 97 files.
Version 4.03 of the Help Compiler is now available for free download from
Microsoft. Future reprints and editions of the Microsoft Windows 95 Help
Authoring Kit will include the corrected compiler.

RESOLUTION
==========

The self-extracting archive file, Hcwsetup.exe, contains the Microsoft Help
Workshop version 4.03 and instructions for installing this program.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  HCWSETUP.EXE
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/win95/MSPRESS/1.0/W9X/EN-US/hcwsetup.exe)
