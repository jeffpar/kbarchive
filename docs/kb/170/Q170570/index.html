SUMMARY
=======

This article demonstrates how to build a Windows message handler in Visual
Basic. It traps the right-click message and replaces the default context menu
with a custom built one.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Prior to the release of Visual Basic 5.0, many developers used third-party
Windows message-handling tools or developed their own with tools such as
Microsoft Visual C++. With the addition of the AddressOf function to Visual
Basic 5.0 and higher, developers can now create their own Windows message
handling routines within their Visual Basic applications.

For example, when a user right-clicks on a textbox in Windows 95, Windows 98,
Windows Me, Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000, the operating system automatically
displays a default context menu. This default behavior occurs before the Visual
Basic application fires the MouseUp event. Without the use of a Windows message
handler, there is no way to replace the default context menu with a custom built
context menu.

The following code shows how to build a Windows message handler to trap and
discard the right-click message and to replace the default context menu with a
custom built one.

WARNING: Using AddressOf may cause unpredictable results if you don't completely
understand the concept of function callbacks. You must understand how the basic
portion of the callback works, and also the code of the DLL into which you are
passing your function address. Debugging such interactions is difficult because
the program runs in the same process as the development environment. In some
cases, systematic debugging may not be possible. See details in the REFERENCES
section of this article for more information.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Use the Menu Editor to add two menu items to the form:

  a. For the first menu item, set its Caption property to "My Popup," its Name
     property to "mnuPopup," and its Visible property to "False."

  b. For the second menu item, set its Caption property to "My Context," its
     Name property to "mnuPopupContext," and use the arrow keys to indent the
     item to be a submenu of the first item.

3. Add two CommandButtons and a textbox to the form:

  a. For the first CommandButton, set its Name property to "cmdHook" and its
     Caption property to "&amp;Hook."

  b. For the second CommandButton, set its Name property to "cmdUnHook" and its
     Caption property to "&amp;UnHook."

  c. For the textbox, set its Name property to "txtHook" and its Text property
     to "Right Click On Me!"

4. Add the following code to the form:

        Private Sub cmdHook_Click()
            Hook
        End Sub

        Private Sub cmdUnHook_Click()
            UnHook
        End Sub

        Private Sub Form_Load()
            gHW = txtHook.hWnd
        End Sub

        Private Sub txtHook_MouseUp(Button As Integer, Shift As Integer, _
                                    X As Single, Y As Single)
            If Button = vbRightButton Then
                PopupMenu mnuPopup
            End If
        End Sub

5. Add a Module to the project.

6. Add the following code to the new Module:

      Declare Function CallWindowProc Lib "user32" Alias "CallWindowProcA" _
             (ByVal lpPrevWndFunc As Long, _
              ByVal hWnd As Long, _
              ByVal Msg As Long, _
              ByVal wParam As Long, _
              ByVal lParam As Long) As Long

      Declare Function SetWindowLong Lib "user32" Alias "SetWindowLongA" _
             (ByVal hWnd As Long, _
              ByVal nIndex As Long, _
              ByVal dwNewLong As Long) As Long

      Public Const GWL_WNDPROC = -4

      Public Const WM_RBUTTONUP = &amp;H205

      Global lpPrevWndProc As Long
      Global gHW As Long

      Public Sub Hook()
          lpPrevWndProc = SetWindowLong(gHW, GWL_WNDPROC, _
                                       AddressOf WindowProc)
      End Sub

      Public Sub UnHook()
          Dim lngReturnValue As Long
          lngReturnValue = SetWindowLong(gHW, GWL_WNDPROC, lpPrevWndProc)
      End Sub

      Function WindowProc(ByVal hw As Long, _
                          ByVal uMsg As Long, _
                          ByVal wParam As Long, _
                          ByVal lParam As Long) As Long

          Select Case uMsg
              Case WM_RBUTTONUP
                  Form1.PopupMenu Form1.mnuPopup
              Case Else
                  WindowProc = CallWindowProc(lpPrevWndProc, hw, _
                                             uMsg, wParam, lParam)
          End Select
      End Function

7. Save the project and run it. Right-click on the textbox and notice that the
  default context menu appears before the custom menu. Click on the
  CommandButton marked "Hook" to enable the Windows message handler.
  Right-click on the textbox and note that the default context menu no longer
  appears. Be sure to click on the CommandButton marked "UnHook" before
  quitting the application. Always disable a custom Windows message handler
  before the application terminates. Clicking the End button, while the Windows
  message handler is still enabled, will cause an IPF.
