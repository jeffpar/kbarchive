-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Over time, the Windows NT system responsiveness appears sluggish, and clients
may report a gradual decrease in system performance.

By tracking the amount of Private Bytes for Services.exe, it can be observed that
over time it increases without decreasing. This is viewable using Windows NT
Performance Monitor by choosing the following counter to monitor:

  Object: Process
  Instance: SERVICES
  Counter: Private Bytes

CAUSE
=====

During client authentication on Windows NT servers (non-Domain Controllers), a
lookup of the current Windows NT domain name is performed. A pointer to the
Windows NT domain name is saved in a global location without freeing the
previous Windows NT domain name that is already stored there.

This memory leak problem can effect Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft SNA Server
when running on a Windows NT server. Each time an Exchange or SNA Server client
connects to the server over sockets, a small memory leak occurs on the server.
This eventually causes performance degradation and requires a reboot to
recover.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.


Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. A
supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
