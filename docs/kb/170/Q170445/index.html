-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The computer that is running Microsoft Exchange Server reboots frequently (every
few minutes).

CAUSE
=====

McAfee anti-virus software running on the Exchange Server computer conflicts
with the Microsoft Exchange Server software and causes the server to reboot.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can work around the problem using either of the following methods.

Prevent Services from Starting
------------------------------

One way to avoid the conflict is to prevent the Microsoft Exchange Server
services from starting up. To do this, rename the Exchsrvr\Dsadata directory, or
disconnect the drives which contain the Exchange Server databases.

Set Services to Manual
----------------------

As an alternate method to work around the problem, you can change the Microsoft
Exchange Services Startup Type option from Automatic to Manual. After the system
boots with the Exchange Server services stopped, set the McAfee anti-virus
service to manual startup and restart the server or remove the McAfee software
from the server.

The anti-virus software incorrectly identifies one or more files as a virus and
may attempt to repair the files that appear to be damaged. This might corrupt
some Exchange files that were modified through the conflict process. Because the
server has been rebooting, you should verify the integrity of the Exchange
files. To do this, run Mtacheck.exe now. You should also verify possible damage
to the information store databases by running the following command:

  edbutil /MH C:\exchsrvr\Priv.edb &gt; c:\dumpedb.txt
