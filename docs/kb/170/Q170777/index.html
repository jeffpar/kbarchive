SUMMARY
=======

The SNA Server 802.2 DLC link service communicates over the Windows NT DLC
transport protocol to support DLC connections over Token Ring, Ethernet, or
FDDI. If a 802.2 DLC connection is lost for any reason, the Windows NT DLC
interface returns a DLC status code in a DLC READ response to the SNA Server
802.2 link service. This status code is interpreted by the link service and
mapped to the actual "qualifier" that is reported in the Windows NT application
event log as follows:

  Source: SNA Server
  Event ID: 23
  Description:
  Connection &lt;name&gt; using Link Service &lt;link&gt; failed.
  Qualifier = 00xx

The qualifier codes are documented in the SNA Server Reference Guide. For 802.2
links, the following qualifiers can occur:

  29 = Remote node not active
  AE = DISC/DM received
  AF = Link lost
  AB = SABME received while connection active
  AC = FRMR (frame reject) sent
  AD = FRMR (frame reject) received

If a FRMR is causing the connection failure, SNA Server will indicate additional
information about the FRMR in one of the following events:

  Event 227  FRMR received
  (Windows NT DLC received a FRMR from the remote system)

  Event 228  FRMR sent
 (Windows NT DLC sent a FRMR to the remote system)

These events include a "FRMR code" returned by DLC to indicate the cause of the
FRMR.

This article describes how to interpret the DLC status code returned by the DLC
READ response, which can be captured within an SNA Server 802.2 link service
"Level 2" trace.

NOTE: It is not necessary to decode the READ response from a Level 2 trace to
determine the cause of a failure, since the Event 23, 227, and 228 events
already indicate the relevant information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows NT DLC programming interface (DLCAPI.DLL), supports the CCB2 DLC
interface, as documented by the IBM Local Area Network Technical Reference (IBM
document #SC30-3383). This interface is used by the SNA Server 802.2 link
service to support SNA communication over Token Ring, Ethernet, and FDDI.

After an 802.2 DLC connection is established, the DLC interface indicates a
connection failure to SNA Server by responding to a DLC READ command and
indicating a DLC Status code. Here is the format of the READ structure returned
by DLC:

  CCB2 Structure
  ==============

  Parameter       Byte Len  Type  Description

  CCB_ADAPTER        1      DB    Adapter number (0 or 1)
  CCB_COMMAND        1      DB    Command field (31 = READ)
  CCB_RETCODE        1      DB    Completion code
  CCB_WORK           1      DB    Adapter support software work area
  CCB_POINTER        4      DW    Queue pointer
  CCB_CMPL_FLAG      4      DD    Command completion flag
  CCB_PARM_OFFSET    2      DW    Offset to CCB2 parameter table
                                (Pointer to READ Parameter Table below)

  [ other parameters ]

  CCB2 Parameter Table for READ
  =============================

  Parameter       Byte Len  Type  Description

  STATION_ID         2      DW   SAP station ID
  OPTION_INDICATOR   1      DB   READ option indicator
  EVENT_SET          1      DB   Set of events for notification
  EVENT              1      DB   Posting event (*)
  CRITICAL_SUBSET    1      DB   Critical event subset identifier (*)
  &lt;reserved&gt;         2      DB   &lt;unused &gt; (**)
  NOTIFICATION_FLAG  4      DD   Event user notification flag (*)
  STATION_ID         2      DW   Station ID
  DLC_STATUS_CODE    2      DW   DLC status code
  FRMR_DATA          5      DB   Five byte FRMR "reason code"
  ACCESS_PRIORITY    1      DB   New access priority if status bit 5 is "on".
  REMOTE_NODE        6      DB   6-byte remote node address
  REMOTE_SAP         1      DB   Remote SAP address
  &lt;reserved&gt;         1      DB   &lt;unused&gt;
  USER_STAT_VALUE    2      DW   User value as defined in DLC.OPEN.SAP command

(*)  Indicates a returned value  
(**) In Windows NT DLC, there are 2 unused bytes resulting from the
    use of a non-packed CCB2 structure

Using the SNA Server Trace program (SNATRACE), it is possible to capture all DLC
calls made by the 802.2 link service to the Windows NT DLC interface by enabling
"Level 2" message tracing. If a DLC connection failure occurs, a DLC READ
command will complete, and may appear as follows:

  DLC   --------------------------------------------------
  DLC   READ               OK
  DLC   ---- DLC API control block at address 7c5e0----
  DLC    00310000 00000000 00000000 FCC50700
  DLC    D4000000 00000000 00002000
  DLC
  DLC    0004010C 08000000 01000000 01040040
  DLC    00000000 00004201 02998122 04041FC0
  DLC   --------------------------------------------------

The first two lines correspond to the CCB2 structure passed in the DLC API
control block, while the last two lines correspond to the CCB parameter table
for the READ command. Using the structure definition above, the parameter table
can be interpreted as follows:

  0004 = station ID 
  01   = option indicator
  0C   = event set
  08   = event
  00   = critical subset
  0000 = padding (unused)
  01000000 = notification flag 
  0104 = station ID (non-Intel format = 0401)
  0040 = DLC status code (non-Intel format = 4000)
  00000000 00 = FRMR data 
  00   = access priority
  42 01 02 99 81 22 04 = remote node address
  04   = remote SAP
  1F   = reserved
  C0   = user status value

Note that the DLC status code (DW = two byte "word" value) is stored in memory in
Intel format, and needs to be "flipped" to show the real value as interpreted by
the 802.2 link service.

Using the DLC status code definitions below (as documented in Appendix B of the
IBM LAN Technical Reference), a status code of 0x4000 is interpreted as
follows:

  0x4000 (hex) = 0100 0000 0000 0000 (binary)

  Bit 14 on = DM or DISC received

  DLC Status Codes

  14     DM or DISC received

  8      Remote station has left a "local busy" condition
