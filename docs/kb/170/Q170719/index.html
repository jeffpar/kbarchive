-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When you use the SendKeys function after calling a dialog box, your macro does
not run as expected. For example, the following macro does not run correctly:

     Sub SendKeysExample()
        ChDir "C:\My Documents"           ' Change Directory.
        Dialogs(wdDialogFileOpen).Show    ' Show the FileOpen dialog.
        SendKeys "%A" '                   ' Send the ALT+A keystroke.
     End Sub

CAUSE
=====

Visual Basic for Applications processes code one line at a time. The SendKeys
function sends the specified keys to the active application, just as if they
were typed at the keyboard. If Word is not the active application, and if wait
is set to -1, Word will wait for all the keys to be processed before
proceeding.

Whenever a Word dialog box is opened, it becomes the active foreground
application and it is ready to take commands; it also must be terminated (with
OK or Cancel) before the next line can be processed.

WORKAROUND
==========

Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without warranty
either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied
warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular purpose. This
article assumes that you are familiar with the programming language being
demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug procedures. Microsoft
support professionals can help explain the functionality of a particular
procedure, but they will not modify these examples to provide added
functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific needs. If you have
limited programming experience, you may want to contact a Microsoft Certified
Partner or the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more
information about Microsoft Certified Partners, please visit the following
Microsoft Web site:

For more information about the support options that are available and about how
to contact Microsoft, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

In the example, the SendKeys command should come before the Dialogs command so
that the FileOpen dialog box can process the keys and display the Advanced
search dialog box. Then the next line of code can be processed.

     Sub SendKeysExample()
        ChDir "C:\My Documents"           ' Change Directory.
        SendKeys "%A"                     ' Send the ALT+A keystroke.
        Dialogs(wdDialogFileOpen).Show    ' Show the FileOpen dialog.
     End Sub
