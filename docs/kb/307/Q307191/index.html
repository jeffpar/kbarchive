SYMPTOMS
========

You can use the Visual Basic 5.0 Setup Wizard to create the setup program for
your application. During the installation process, you may notice that Setup.exe
consumes a lot of CPU time even though Setup1.exe is the process that performs
the main installation tasks.

CAUSE
=====

When you run a setup program build with the Visual Basic Setup Wizard, the setup
program runs in two stages:

1. The Setup.exe (or "bootstrap) program runs to ensure that all system
  dependencies are in place. If so, Setup.exe starts Setup1.exe.

2. While Setup1.exe runs the portion of the setup that is based on the graphical
  user interface (GUI), Setup.exe waits in the background for Setup1.exe to
  finish. Setup.exe waits in the background so that it can clean up after
  Setup1.exe.

Setup.exe waits by means of a polling loop. This polling loop calls the
PeekMessage function with the PM_NOREMOVE value several times, calls the Yield
function, and then checks the exit code of the Setup1.exe process to see if
Setup1.exe has exited. If you watch this process in PerfMon on the system,
Setup.exe consumes all of the free CPU cycles as part of the polling loop.

==========
