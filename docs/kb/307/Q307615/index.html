-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Visual Component Manager (VCM) is a Visual Studio add-in that allows you to
store reusable components in a repository database. The Visual Basic VCM add-in
contains three menu options to extract stored components from the repository:

- Add to project
- Open
- Save to disk

When you use any of these three options on workstations that have the SQL Server
2000 version of the Microsoft Repository, you cannot retrieve the components,
and no files are saved locally. The process fails silently on Visual Studio 6.0
Service Pack 4 (SP4) or earlier. In Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 5, you
receive the following error message:

  This component does not contain any reusable files

CAUSE
=====

The new Microsoft Repository component (Repodbc.dll), which is installed with
SQL Server 2000, is not compatible with the original Visual Studio 6.0 release
of Visual Component Manager.


RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been resolved in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 5 with new
versions of the Vcmagg.dll and Repvcm.dll files.

After you install Service Pack 5, you can successfully publish components to and
retrieve components from the VCM repository database. However, components that
are published before you install Service Pack 5 are invalid and cannot be
recovered.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 5 with the new versions
of Vcmagg.dll and Repvcm.dll.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Install Visual Basic 6.0.

2. Install SQL Server 2000.

3. Open Visual Basic, and then open Visual Component Manager from the View menu.

4. Right-click VCM in the left pane of the VCM window to create a new SQL Server
  VCM repository database.

5. Create or open a Visual Basic project.

6. Right-click the project file in Project Explorer, and then click Publish in
  the shortcut menu to publish the project to the VCM repository.

7. In VCM, browse to the VCM folder where you stored the project. Right-click
  the icon for the stored project, click Save to disk, and then select a local
  destination folder. Notice that the process appears to succeed. However, when
  you look in the destination folder, the stored project files do not exist.

8. Install Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 5.

9. Repeat step 7. Notice that the process fails with the above-mentioned error
  message. When you look in the destination folder, the stored project files do
  not exist.

Workaround
----------

1. Install Visual Basic 6.0 Service Pack 5 and SQL Server 2000.

2. Open Visual Basic, and then open Visual Component Manager from the View menu.

3. Right-click VCM in the left pane of the VCM window to create a new SQL Server
  VCM repository database.

4. Create or open a Visual Basic project.

5. Right-click the project file in Project Explorer, and then click Publish in
  the shortcut menu to publish the project to the VCM repository. Notice that
  the process succeeds and that the project files are stored in the destination
  folder as expected.
