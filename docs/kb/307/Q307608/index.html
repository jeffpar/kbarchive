SUMMARY
=======

URLScan is a security tool that works in conjunction with the IIS Lockdown Tool
to give Internet Information Services (IIS) Web site administrators the ability
to turn off unnecessary features and to restrict the type of HTTP requests that
the server will process. By blocking specific HTTP requests, the URLScan
security tool prevents potentially harmful requests from reaching the server and
from causing damage.

Microsoft has released an updated version of the URLScan security tool, version
2.5, which provides greater security and functionality than earlier versions of
the tool. URLScan 2.5 is an update to URLScan 1.0 and URLScan 2.0, and you can
download the update in this article. When you install this new version, your
earlier version of the URLScan executable file is updated with the URLScan 2.5
executable file, which also updates the URLScan.ini file accordingly, without
making any modifications to your previously configured settings.

You have to install URLScan 2.5 over either URLScan 1.0 or URLScan 2.0. If you do
not currently have URLScan 1.0 or 2.0 on your computer, you should install
URLScan 2.0 as part of the IIS Lockdown Wizard. If you want to install only the
URLScan security tool, you can manually extract it from the IIS Lockdown Tool.

For additional information about how to manually extract the URLScan tool from
the IIS Lockdown Tool, click the article number below to view the article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q315522 HOW TO: Extract the URLScan Tool and Lockdown Template Files

To determine which version of URLScan is installed on your computer, use
Add/Remove Programs. URLScan will be present in the list of installed
components.

NOTE: Both downloads include version 2.5 of URLScan.dll. URLScan-SRP has more
restrictive settings than Baseline URLScan, which is described in the "More
Information" section in this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The URLScan security tool is comprised of two files: URLScan.dll and
URLScan.ini, which are packaged together in URLScan.exe. With this latest update
of URLScan:

- Administrators have an even greater control over the URLScan configuration.

  -and-

- Administrators can secure and lock down the server to a greater degree.

Baseline URLScan
----------------

This download is the baseline version of URLScan 2.5.

This update introduces the following new features:

- The ability to change the log file directory.

- The ability to log long URLs.

- The ability to restrict the size of requests.

The Ability to Change the Log File Directory:

You can use the LoggingDirectory option to specify the folder in which the log
file is stored. You have to use the absolute path (such as c:\directory_path)
for this value. If you do not specify a folder, URLScan creates the log in the
same folder in which URLScan.dll is located.

The Ability to Log Long URLs:

The addition of the LogLongUrls option allows for an increase in the length of
URLS that get logged. In earlier versions, URLScan truncated the log lines to
1024 bytes. The new option provides enhanced logging by increasing the limit to
128 KB. The allowed values are 0 or 1. The default value is 0. If you set the
value to 1, URLScan logs up to 128 KB per request. If you set the value is to 0,
log entries contain only the first 1024 bytes.

The Ability to Restrict the Size of Requests:

With the addition of the RequestLimits section, URLScan can enforce limits on the
size (in bytes) of separate parts of requests that reach the server. The
RequestLimits section includes the following three entries:

- MaxAllowedContentLength: This enforces a maximum value to content-length. It
  does not actually prevent the server from necessarily reading in more data
  than what this value is set to. For example, if a client makes a chunk
  transfer encoded POST, this URLScan option is not effective in tracking the
  size of the entity in the request. The default value is approximately 2 GB
  (2,000,000,000 bytes).

- MaxUrl: This restricts the length of the request URL (in bytes) but it does
  not restrict the length of the query string. When you upgrade URLScan by
  using the installer, the default value is 16 KB.

  NOTE: If you manually extract URLScan.dll from URLScan.exe and do not update
  URLScan.ini, the default setting will be 260 bytes, and you will have to add
  MaxUrl = 16384 to URLScan.ini to overwrite the default setting.

- MaxQueryString: This restricts the length of the query string, in bytes. The
  default value is 4 KB.

In addition, you can impose a byte limit on the size of a specific request header
by prepending Max- to the name of any header. For example, the following entry
imposes a limit of 100 bytes on the 'Content-Type' header:

  Max-Content-Type=100

To list a header and not specify a maximum value, use 0. For example:

  Max-User-Agent=0

Also, any headers that are not listed in this section are not checked for length
limits.

URLScan-SRP
-----------

This download of URLScan can protect against all the vulnerabilities listed in
the Microsoft Security Bulletin MS02-018.

IMPORTANT: The main difference between the URLScan-SRP configuration and that of
the Baseline URLScan lies in its handling of Chunked Encoding data transfers. By
default, chunked encoding transfers are blocked in URLScan-SRP; they are not
blocked by default in the baseline URLScan; therefore, clients that rely on
chunked encoding are blocked by the URLScan-SRP configuration settings. In
addition, uploads to the server are restricted to 30 MB in the URLScan-SRP
configuration. All other features are the same as in the Baseline URLScan
configuration, which is described in the "URLScan Baseline" section.

URLScan 2.0 Features
--------------------

URLScan 2.0 incorporates customer feedback from URLScan 1.0 and extends the
functionality available to administrators. URLScan 2.0 introduced the following
new features:

- The ability to parse the first recognizable extension in a request string.

- An improvement in logging capabilities.

- The ability to include periods as possible extensions.

- The ability to customize a return message for failed requests.

The Ability to Parse the First Recognizable Extension in a Request String:

URLScan 1.0 implements AllowDotInPath=0 to reject requests in the form of
"/abc.dll/def.ghi.htm." It does all of the parsing to find the last recognizable
extension. URLScan 2.0 searches for the first recognizable extension in the
request string. If the extension is .dll, .com, or .exe, that extension is
stored (where) instead, and then (what passes) passes the AllowDotInPath test.

For example, in URLScan 1.0, the string "/_vti_bin/shtml.dll/def.ghi.htm" results
in an extension of .htm and fails the AllowDotInPath test. In URLScan 2.0, the
string "/_vti_bin/shtml.dll/def.ghi.htm" results in an extension of .dll and
passes the AllowDotInPath test.

An Improvement in URLScan Logging Capabilities:

URLScan 2.0 changes the log output for URLs so that they are automatically
preceded with the instance ID of the site for the request (such as,
"1:/def.htr", instead of "/def.htr"). Administrators can also create daily log
files, where the file name is in the form of "URLScan.092801.log" using
PerDayLogging. The date format in the URLScan.log has been changed from [Fri,
Sept 28 2001 - 01:01:01] to [09-28-2001 - 01:01:01], which makes it easier to
parse the logs programmatically.

The Ability to Include Periods as Possible Extensions:

URLScan 2.0 supports entering period (.) as an extension to the [AllowExtensions]
and [DenyExtensions] sections of the URLScan.ini file. By adding a period to
[AllowExtensions] or [DenyExtensions], administrators can prohibit URLs without
extensions. The ability to customize return message for failed requests URLScan
2.0 adds a new option, RejectResponseUrl, that the administrator can use to
specify a URL to return to the client in the case of a rejected request. Not
only can the administrator select what the client sees, but it defaults to
Rejected-By-URLScan, which returns a complete custom error 404 by default.

You can also configure URLScan to send a standard 404 response to the client. By
setting RejectFastPath to 1, URLScan ignores the RejectResponseUrl option and
returns a standard 404 response back to the client in the case of a rejected
request. By enabling RejectFastPath, IIS cannot return a custom 404 response or
log some parts of the request into the IIS log file; however, the URLScan log
file will still contain complete information about rejected requests.

For more information about the features in URLScan 2.0, please read the
documentation that is packaged in URLScan.exe.

URLScan 1.0 Features
--------------------

With URLScan 1.0, the administrator can reject requests based on the following
criteria:

- Request method (verb).

- File extension of the resource that is requested.

- Suspicious URL encoding.

- Presence of non-ASCII characters in the URL.

- Presence of specified character sequences in the URL.

- Presence of specified headers in the request.

URLScan 1.0 shipped with limited functionality and has been greatly improved in
later versions. For more information about the features in URLScan 1.0, please
read the documentation that is packaged in URLScan.exe.

How to Manually Install URLScan 2.5
-----------------------------------

To automatically install URLScan 2.5, download and run the appropriate
URLScan.exe file by using the links in the "Summary" section of this article. To
manually install URLScan 2.5, perform the following steps:

1. Ensure that you have URLScan 1.0 or URLScan 2.0 on your computer. You have to
  install URLScan 2.5 over either URLScan 1.0 or URLScan 2.0.

  If you do not currently have URLScan 1.0 or 2.0 on your computer, install
  URLScan 2.0 as part of the IIS Lockdown Wizard.

  If you want to install only the URLScan security tool, you can manually
  extract it from the IIS Lockdown Tool.

  For additional information about manually extracting the URLScan tool from the
  IIS Lockdown Tool, click the article number below to view the article in the
  Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q315522 HOW TO: Extract the URLScan Tool and Lockdown Template Files

2. Download URLScan.exe to a directory location of your choice.

3. From the command line, navigate to the directory where you saved URLScan.exe.

4. Type "URLScan.exe /x" (without the quotation marks)

5. Stop the World Wide Web Publishing Service.

6. Replace the existing version of URLScan.dll with URLScan.dll, version 2.5.

7. Manually add the following entries to your existing URLScan.ini file:

  1. Add the following section to the URLScan.ini file:

[RequestLimits] 
MaxAllowedContentLength=30,000,000 (Urlscan-SRP) MaxAllowedContentLength=2,000,000,000 (Baseline Urlscan) 
MaxUrl=16384 
MaxQueryString=4096

  2. Add the following entries to the options section:

LoggingDirectory= 
LogLongUrls=0

  3. Add the transfer-encoding header from the DenyHeaders section
     (Urlscan-SRP).

  4. Start the World Wide Web Publishing Service.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

Question: What is URLScan?
Answer: URLScan screens all incoming requests to the server and filters them
based on rules set by the administrator. This secures the server by ensuring
that only valid requests are processed. URLScan is effective in protecting Web
servers because most malicious attacks share a common characteristic--they
involve the use of a request that is unusual in some way. For example, the
request might be:

- Extremely long.
- Requesting an unusual action.
- Encoded by using an alternate character set, or include character sequences
  that are rarely seen in legitimate requests.

By filtering out all unusual requests, URLScan prevents them from reaching the
server and potentially causing damage.

Question: I am already using URLScan 2.0. Why should I download this update?
Answer: URLScan 2.5 includes new features have been added to URLScan to provide
better security. These are as follows:

- The ability to change the log file directory.

- The ability to log long URLs.

- The ability to restrict the size of requests.

Question: Why is Microsoft shipping two versions of URLScan?
Answer: Microsoft is shipping two versions of URLScan because different servers
have different requirements and shipping a single version might break some
applications. The main difference between the URLScan-SRP configuration and that
of the Baseline URLScan lies in its handling of Chunked Encoding data transfers.
By default, chunked encoding transfers are blocked in URLScan-SRP; they are not
blocked by default in the baseline URLScan. In addition, uploads to the server
are restricted to 30 MB in the URLScan-SRP configuration.

Question: I have already configured URLScan for my site. Will URLScan 2.5
overwrite my current configuration settings?
Answer: No. URLScan 2.5 only adds new entries to your existing configuration
file.

Question: I am trying to install URLScan 2.5 and it will not install. What is
wrong?
Answer: URLScan 2.5 only installs over URLScan 1.0 or URLScan 2.0, so you
probably do not have a version of URLScan already installed on your computer. If
you do not currently have URLScan 1.0 or 2.0 on your computer, install URLScan
2.0 as part of the IIS Lockdown Wizard.

If you have URLScan installed on your computer and the installation of URLScan
2.5 still fails, the existing version of URLScan is probably installed as a site
filter and not as a global filter. For the URLScan 2.5 installation to be
successful, you must have any previous version of URLScan installed as a global
filter.

Question: My applications do not work after installing URLScan 2.5. I would like
to revert back to my preexisting URLScan.ini configuration until I determine the
problem. How do I undo the additions to URLScan.ini?
Answer: URLScan 2.0 introduced the /~* special value to RejectResponseUrl that
puts URLScan in a logging-only mode so that administrators can better figure out
why URLScan is rejecting a request. If you still want to rollback all changes,
please follow the procedure in the "Rolling Back Changes Made to the URLScan.ini
File by URLScan 2.5" section.

Question: If URLScan-SRP protects me against all vulnerabilities in the Microsoft
Security Bulletin MS02-018, is it necessary to apply the patches specified in
the Microsoft Security Bulletin MS02-018?
Answer: Yes, it is absolutely necessary. Patches provide the ultimate fix to this
vulnerability. Microsoft strongly recommends that you apply the Security Rollup
patch as soon as possible to protect from any existing vulnerability.

Question: I am not sure if I am using chunk encoding in any of my custom
applications. What is it?
Answer: Chunked transfer encoding transmits the message body to the client as
chunks that are stamped with their size. This allows the client to ensure that
it has received all of the data that was sent from the server. Chunked transfer
encoding is similar to MIME encoding in relation to Internet mail. For more
information, refer to RFC 2616.

Question: Will there be more updates to the URLScan security tool?
Answer: Yes, Microsoft continually makes changes to their tools and products in
response to customers' needs and the changing landscape of security.
