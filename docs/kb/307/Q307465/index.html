The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform a Move Group/Failover procedure in a Windows NT 4.0-based
cluster, the following error message may be logged in the Cluster log:

  Physical Disk "DRIVELETTER:" DiskspCheckPath: FindFirstFile for
  "DRIVELETTER:" failed, error 3.

This error message is typically logged when the second cluster of a two-node
cluster is brought online if the cluster had failback for a cluster group set to
failback to that node.

You may also receive the following error message when you perform a Move Group
procedure:

  Physical Disk "DRIVELETTER:" SCSI, error reserving disk, error 21.

CAUSE
=====

You receive the following error message if you install a regression fix from
Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6a (SP6a):

  Physical Disk "DRIVELETTER:" SCSI, error reserving disk, error 21

Under certain conditions, the cluster disk driver (Clusdisk.sys) attempts to
attach to devices and does not read a partition table from the devices (assuming
that they are cluster disks that are reserved by the other node).
