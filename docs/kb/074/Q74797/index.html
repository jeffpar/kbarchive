SUMMARY
=======

FormEdit.exe is a sample program that demonstrates one implementation of
creating a form edit under Windows. Each form can be moved and sized with the
mouse.

This program uses two novel techniques to move and size the windows. These
techniques are discussed in detail below.

Each field on the form is a child window. Each child window has an ID value that
corresponds to a structure in a database. In this example, the database is a
simple array.

Moving Windows
--------------

The coordinates for each mouse message that is sent to the child window are
translated into the corresponding coordinates in the parent window, then the
message is passed to the parent window. In this manner, the parent window
receives all mouse messages.

If the parent window receives a WM_LBUTTONDOWN message, it checks to see if the
point of the click is within a child window; if so, a state variable is set.

When the WM_MOUSEMOVE message is received, the parent will check the state
variable. If it set, the child window is moved to the new position selected with
the mouse.

Once the WM_LBUTTONUP message is received, the state variable is cleared.

The child window responds to the WM_MOVE message by updating its record
structure.

Sizing Windows
--------------

Each child window is created with the WS_THICKFRAME style bit.

The WM_NCPAINT message is trapped, and the DrawCoolBorder() function is called in
the place of standard nonclient painting processing. A three dimensional effect
is drawn instead of the standard Windows sizing border. When the user moves the
mouse over this area, the standard sizing arrows are displayed, and the user can
change the window size using conventional click-and-drag methods.

The child window responds to the WM_SIZE message by updating its record
structure.
