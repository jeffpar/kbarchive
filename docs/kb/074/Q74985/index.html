SUMMARY
=======

Three size factors determine the space needed to load a device driver or TSR
(terminate-and-stay-resident) program into the upper memory area (UMA). The most
important of these factors is the size that must be available in one contiguous
upper memory block (UMB) for the device driver or TSR to load high. These
factors are as follows:

Load Size
---------

The size of the device/TSR when it's first loaded, before it begins execution.
Frequently this is the size of the file on the disk, but may be larger.

Initialization Size
-------------------

The size of the device/TSR and any initialization space it may need. Frequently
the initialization size is equal to load size, but it may be the largest of the
three sizes.

Final Size
----------

The amount of memory needed after the completion of the initialization process.
Frequently the smallest of the three sizes. This is the size indicated by the
MEM command using the /P or /C switches.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because of the lack of standards for device driver and TSR initialization, it is
virtually impossible to determine the memory needed in any other manner than
trial and error. Load size can be determined; however, initialization and final
sizes will vary from program to program.

Quantity 1
----------

For .COM files and device drivers that follow standard conventions (.SYS), the
load size will be the file size on disk rounded up to the nearest paragraph (16
bytes). Note that some .SYS files will actually be .EXE files. To determine
this, look at the first two bytes of the file. If these bytes are MZ in ASCII or
4D and 5A in hex, it is an executable file.

Executable files (.EXE) files contain the load size information in the program
header (.EXE file header). The .EXE file load size does not necessarily relate
to the file size on disk. At an offset of 10 and 12 bytes respectively reside
the minimum and maximum number of pages (16 bytes) needed by the executable file
in addition to the file size. EXEHDR.EXE included with many programming products
(including Microsoft C Compiler) will allow you to look at the .EXE file header
information. From this information you will be able to approximate the load size
of an .EXE program.

For example, by running EXEHDR.EXE included with Microsoft C version 6.0a on
EMM386.EXE, the following information will be displayed:

Microsoft (R) EXE File Header Utility  Version 2.01

Exports:
ord obj  offset    name
 1   1  000012e4  LoadHi_DDB exported, shared data

By totaling the virtual sizes of 1a08H, 1218H, and 02AH you can determine the
load size to be a total of 11338 decimal. Note that this is not necessarily the
ending memory used by EMM386.EXE, but the initial load size.

Quantity 2
----------

Many device drivers undergo an initialization process that normally requires more
memory than the ending size of the driver. Frequently the initialization memory
is placed after the device driver and subsequently freed upon completion of the
initialization process. The method for doing so is not standardized, and
therefore not consistent. For this reason, there is no way of knowing what
method a driver developer will use, and therefore no way of determining how much
memory will be used, other than by actually disassembling the code and working
through the program.

Quantity 3
----------

The final quantity, the Break address of the driver, is returned during the INIT
procedure of a device driver or the termination call of a TSR.

When loading a device driver, DOS will pass the device driver a command code 0
for initialization. It is the device driver's responsibility to fill the Request
Header (a DOS data structure) with the break address (ending address) of the
device driver. When and where the code is located that the device driver uses to
accomplish this task is completely up to the programmer. For this reason, the
only way of determining the break address is to debug the device driver.

A TSR program will make a DOS function call to one of the following functions:

     Int 21h function 00h
     Int 21h function 31h
     Int 21h function 4Ch
     Int 27h

The program will provide DOS with the break address of the TSR via different
methods depending upon the function used.
