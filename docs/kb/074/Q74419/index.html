SYMPTOMS
========

One of the following error messages will occur if you use this program with
Windows version 3.0:

  The conventional memory in your system is fragmented and Windows cannot run
  in 386 enhanced mode. Please reboot your computer and try again or else run
  Windows in real mode by typing win /r.

- In Standard Mode

  Cannot run Windows in standard mode. Check to ensure you are not running
  other protected mode software, or run in real mode.


WORKAROUND
==========

Do not to use the Erase Protect utility when running Windows 3.0 in standard or
386 enhanced mode. You can find out how to disable this program by referring to
"The Norton Utilities User's Guide" on page 9-3.

-or-

Upgrade to Norton Utilities version 6.01. Erase Protect was revised in version
6.01 and Norton Desktop version 1.0 to function properly with Windows 3.0.

MORE INFORMATION

The Erase Protect program is a terminate-and-stay-resident program (TSR) that
moves deleted files to another, less-used part of your disk to protect them from
being overwritten. The deleted files are renamed and copied into hidden
directory called TRASHCAN.
