-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Routing and Remote Access Service Update for Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to establish a permanent connection between a system running
Routing and Remote Access Service and another router using a dial on demand
connection, the modem disconnects after 20 minutes of inactivity. This
disconnection is regardless of enabling the Persistent Connection radio button
on the Dialing tab when you configure the dial on demand interface.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is because a registry setting is overriding the Persistent
Connection option.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, it will be necessary to modify the autodisconnect
time in the registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

The AutoDisconnect value is located in:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RemoteAccess
\Parameters

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

Value: AutoDisconnect
Data Type: REG_DWORD
Default Value: 14
Value Range: 0-6000

This value sets the time interval (in minutes/converted to hex), after which
inactive connections are terminated. Inactivity is measured by lack of session
data transfer.

To ensure that a Persistent Connection does not disconnect because of inactivity
over the line, you will need to set the above parameter to 0, especially if
clients are running NetBIOS datagram applications. Setting this parameter to 0
disables AutoDisconnect. The default entry is 14h (20 in decimal). The valid
range for this entry can be from 0-6000 (24,576 minutes). If you do want to set
a specific time period for the disconnect feature, you will need to convert the
number of minutes (before inactivity disconnect) to hex and insert this number
in the registry value detailed above.
