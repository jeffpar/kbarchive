MORE INFORMATION
================

In general, here are the commands used on the USR Total Control to set up a
Shared Secret for Radius accounting. If you have specific questions, please
contact USR/3Com support.

Commands to use if you are running USR Netserver software:

1. Set authentic &lt;IP address of radius server&gt;;

2. Set secret &lt;secret key&gt;;

3. Set accounting &lt;IP address of accounting server&gt; &lt;secret key&gt;;

4. Set acct_authchk on;

5. Save all.

For customers with Netserver 8/16, Netserver 8plus or other USR/3Com equipment
that uses the newer Netserver plus code 4.1.x, a known bug exists in the 3Com
code that does not allow a user to set up a Shared Secret for Radius accounting
as required by RFC2139. USR/3Com has released a hotfix to this problem.
Customers affected should contact 3Com and request "Emergency release
4.1.86.[ASCII 148]

The above steps are given as a guideline only on how to set up the USR Total
Control. For specifics, please contact USR/3Com support.

SYMPTOMS
========

When using a U.S. Robotics(USR)/3Com Total Control Chassis with Microsoft
Internet Authentication Service (Radius), administrators may notice that the
Radius log files do not show up properly.

CAUSE
=====

There are several reasons why this may occur. Assuming authentication is working
properly and users are able to log on, the most likely causes are as follows:

- A known bug exists in the Total Control firmware. Please ensure you are
  running version 3.6.28 or later. For more information, please contact
  USR/3Com.

- By default, Radius requires that the Shared Secret that is used for
  authentication also be used for accounting. If no Shared Secret is set up in
  the USR box, Radius Logs are not created.
