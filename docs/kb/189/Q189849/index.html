-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server versions 4.0, 4.0a 
- the operating system: Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set up the client disk on a computer running Windows 98, you may
receive a general protection fault (GP fault) error message in Setup.exe from
source IPDETECT while installing the networking options.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the following options are not installed:

- TCP/IP

- File and Print Sharing for Microsoft Networks

- Client Services for Microsoft Networks

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, perform one of the following:

- Make sure you have the TCP/IP protocol installed with no other protocols
  installed.

- Make sure the File and Print Sharing for Microsoft Networks service is
  installed.

- Remove the Microsoft Family logon service.

- Add Client Services for Microsoft Networks

After you set up all of these options, restart the computer running Windows 98
and rerun the client setup disk.

If your setup attempt does not work and you have checked the above information
(and the client applications still do not install correctly), perform the
following on the server:

1. In Manager Server Console, click More Task, and then click Manage Computers.

2. Select the Windows 98 computer you are installing.

3. Click Add software.

4. Select the user that will be using this computer.

5. Select all the applications you would like to install.

6. Log off the client computer and log back on as the user. The client
  application should install correctly now.
