MORE INFORMATION
================

Back Cover: Systems Requirements Incorrect
------------------------------------------

The system requirements for this book do not state that two computers are
required for the practice exercises. However, you will need two computers for
the networking exercises in this book.

To complete the lessons, you must have two computers, the first capable of
running Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 and the second capable of running both
Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 and Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0.

Both computers must have the following minimum configuration:

- 486/33 or higher Intel-based processor

- 16 MB of RAM (32 MB recommended)

- A minimum of 450 MB of available hard disk space on the first computer

- A minimum of 350 MB of available hard disk space on the second computer

- SVGA display adapter and monitor capable of 256 colors

- Microsoft Mouse or compatible pointing device

- Network adapter card and related cables

- One 3.5" high-density floppy disk drive

- CD-ROM drive

- Sound card and speakers (optional)

- Serial port (optional - for the RAS practice)

- Null modem cable for testing RAS (optional)

For those who do not have a null-modem cable, a simulation for RAS is included
with the course.

NOTE: Both computers must have existing Microsoft operating systems such as
MS-DOS, Windows 3.x, or Windows NT 3.x. We recommend that one computer be able
to run multimedia programs so that you can view the video included with the
course.


Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of the book, it may already
contain the above corrections.
