The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

You can customize the installation program created by the Setup Wizard (renamed
Package and Deployment Wizard, or PDW, in Visual Basic 6.0) by modifying the
Setup1.vbp project, also known as the Setup Toolkit. However, you cannot run or
debug this project in the Visual Basic Design Environment unless you emulate the
behavior of the compiled setup routine.

NOTE: Microsoft Technical Support does not support the modification of the setup
process or any of the setup files. Support is provided for the Setup Wizard on
an "as is" basis only.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before you can run the Visual Basic portion of setup, the Setup.exe program must
copy certain files to their destination directories. Setup.exe also creates an
uninstall log file that is used by Setup1.exe for 32-bit applications, and it
copies Setup1.lst to the \Windows directory so it will not be swapped out.

Setup.exe invokes Setup1.exe (Setup132.exe using Visual Basic 4 32-bit) with
certain command-line arguments. In order to run the Setup1 project in the Visual
Basic Design Environment, these arguments must be set. Do this by launching the
Visual Basic Design Environment from the Setup program and specifying your
modified Setup1.vbp as a command-line argument.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Run the Application Setup Wizard or PDW, and follow the steps to produce the
  default setup distribution set in a folder.

2. Edit the Setup.lst file in a text editor, such as Notepad. Use the method
  described below for the version of Visual Basic installed, making changes
  where noted:

  Visual Basic 4.0 16-bit

  Locate:

  Setup=setup1.exe

  Replace it with:

  Setup=c:\vb\vb.exe c:\vb\setupkit\setup1\setup1.vbp /cmd

  Visual Basic 4.0 32-bit

  Locate:

  Setup=setup132.exe

  Replace it with:

  Setup=c:\vb\vb32.exe c:\vb\setupkit\setup1\setup1.vbp /cmd

  Visual Basic 5.0

  Locate:

  Setup=setup1.exe

  Replace it with:

  Setup="c:\program files\devstudio\vb\vb5.exe"
        "c:\program files\devstudio\vb\setupkit\setup1\setup1.vbp" /cmd

  NOTE: The entry should be on one line only, with necessary quotation marks
  depending on long file name usage.

  Visual Basic 6.0

  Locate:

  Spawn=setup1.exe

  Replace it with:

  Spawn=C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~1\VB98\VB6.exe 
  C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~1\VB98\Wizards\PDWizard\Setup1\Setup1.vbp /cmd

  NOTE: The entry should be on one line only. Your path may vary depending upon
  where you installed Visual Basic 6.0. Please change the path in the example
  above as needed, using short file names (8.3).

  Modify the paths as appropriate. Save Setup.lst when this step is complete.

3. Start the installation by running Setup.exe.

  After Setup.exe finishes, it will start the Visual Basic Design Environment
  with the Setup Toolkit (Setup1.vbp) project loaded, the correct files in the
  correct places, the uninstall log already created, and with the command-line
  arguments set properly. This is the function of the /cmd argument. It allows
  Visual Basic to pick up the command-line arguments that Setup.exe sends to
  the second portion of the installation process, Setup1.exe (Setup132.exe
  using Visual Basic 4.0).

4. Add the desired break points. Press the F5 or F8 key to run the project.

  Note that if you click the "Exit Setup" button at any time while running the
  project, or if the program runs to the end either successfully or by a
  trapped error, the log file (setup.lst) and the uninstall program are
  deleted. Conversely, if you run repeated tests of your version of Setup
  Toolkit, multiple copies of the log file (StXunst.000, StXunst.001, and so
  on) are copied into your \Windows directory, where "X" is the version of
  Visual Basic being used. These may be safely deleted after you exit the
  Visual Basic Design Environment.
