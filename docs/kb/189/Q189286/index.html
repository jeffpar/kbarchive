The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

When using Microsoft Exchange Server, it may be necessary to delete a server
from the site. This article documents the procedure as well as the issues to be
aware of when performing this task.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is recommended that you back up the Exchange Server computer before removing
it.

Read this entire article before beginning the process.

1. Verify that there are no mail connectors on this server. If there are, bring
  up another connector in the site and verify mail flow. Next, remove the
  connector or connectors on the server to be deleted. Retest message flow.

2. In Control Panel, stop the Exchange-related services on the server you want
  to delete.

3. Connect using the Exchange Administrator program to another server within the
  same site. Be sure to connect while logged in as the Exchange Service account
  or an account with equivalent privileges.

4. Select the server you want to delete. On the Edit menu, click Delete.

Consider the following BEFORE removing a server from a site:

- If this is the first server in the site, follow the steps in the following
  Knowledge Base article:

  Q152959 XADM: How to Remove the First Exchange Server in a Site

- If this server is the public folder server, add replicas of the folders that
  are homed on this server to another server within the same site.

  NOTE: The folders will be rehomed to the first server in this site listed on
  the replicas page.

- If this server is the distribution list expansion server for the site, you
  must change the distribution list expansion server attribute for all
  distribution lists homed on this site to "Any server in the site", or choose
  another server in the site to be the expansion server.

  If a new expansion server is not configured, you may have the problem
  discussed in the following Knowledge Base article:

  Q154537 XCON: Congestion in Message Transfer Service, Sending to DL

- If the Exchange Server computer you are removing is the only version of its
  kind within the site and is a later version than the existing servers,
  another server of that same version should be added to the site prior to the
  removal of this server.

If this server is designated as the Bridgehead server for Directory Replication
with another Exchange site, change the Bridgehead server to another server in
the site. This should be done on the properties of the Directory Replication
connector in the local site and in the remote site.

If any connectors, other than site or X400, are installed on this server, the
connectors need to be moved to another server in the site.

If Key Management Server is installed on this server, it must be moved to another
server. For additional information on moving the KM Server to another server,

Base:
