The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW) uses the information located in the
Setup.lst file to install applications. This file contains all relevant
information for the application to be installed. This article describes the
usage of each section in the Setup.lst file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Setup.lst file is created when the PDW is used to package an application. It
is typically located in the same directory as Setup.exe (the application used to
start the installation).

NOTE: The Setup.lst file is a text file that can be viewed and edited using any
text editor. The information below is based on a simple Standard EXE that has
been packaged using the Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW).

The application installation process has two parts:

- Setup.EXE - A bootstrap process that loads the files required to perform the
  actual installation.

- Setup1.EXE - This process does the actual installation of the application:
  program files are copied to their destination, required registry entries are
  made, shortcuts for the desktop are made, etc.

Bootstrap
---------

The Bootstrap section contains initial information used by Setup.exe to install
the application. Included with this is:

- SetupTitle - The name that appears on the blue screen gradient when the PDW
  launches the second part of setup, Setup1.exe.

- SetupText - Text displayed to users by Setup.exe while it copies files
  necessary for Setup1.exe to start, located in the [Bootstrap Files] section.

- CabFile - The name of the file containing all files to be installed.

- Spawn - The name of the second setup application to be run by Setup.exe,
  usually Setup1.exe.

- Uninstal - The name of the uninstall application.

- TmpDir - Specifies the temporary directory used by Setup to install files.

- Cabs - The total number of cab files in the application.

Example of [Bootstrap] section:

  [Bootstrap]
  SetupTitle=Install
  SetupText=Copying Files, please stand by.
  CabFile=Hello.CAB
  Spawn=setup1.exe
  Uninstal=st6unst.exe
  TmpDir=msftqws.pdw
  Cabs=1

Bootstrap Files
---------------

The Bootstrap Files section contains all the necessary files to run the second
part of the installation, Setup1.exe. These files must be in place for any
Microsoft Visual Basic application to work correctly. The files listed here, one
line per file, have the following arguments:

File#=Filename, Install Macro, Register, Shared, Date, Size, Version where each
argument corresponds to:

- File# - The number of the file being installed. These files are in numeric
  order starting at 1.

- Filename - The name of the file to install. This name corresponds to the file
  located in the .CAB file.

- Install Macro - The installation macro used by the Setup process. For
  additional information, please refer the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

- Register - How the file is to be registered, if necessary. The following are
  typical registration processes:

   - None - The file does not need to be registered or cannot be registered by
     the PDW.

   - $(DLLSelfRegister) - Self-registering file containing DLLRegisterServer
     and DLLUnregisterServer functions.

   - $(EXESelfRegister) - Registers any ActiveX EXE that supports the
     /RegServer and /UnRegServer functions.

   - $(TLBRegister) - Registration for Type Libraries.

   - filename.reg - Allows a custom .REG file to register the component.

- Shared - Indicates if the file is a shared system file and will be registered
  as such in the system registry.

- Date - Last modified date.

- Size - Last modified file size.

- Version - Internal version number of the file.

Example of [Bootstrap Files] section:

  [Bootstrap Files]

  12:00:00 AM,1409024,6.0.81.64

IconGroups
----------

In this example, there are two groups of icons to be created "Hello" and "Another
Group." The IconGroups section dictates the name, location on the Start Menu,
and whether the group is a common group or private group on NT machines. The
IconGroups section also contains pointers to the "Hello" and "Another Group"
sections. These sections instruct Setup1.exe what shortcuts to create including
the application to run, title, and the Start In directory for the link. There
will be a section name for each group of icons created.

- Group0=Hello - Section name of Program Group to be created, entitled "Hello."

- PrivateGroup0=True - Dictates whether the group is private or common group on
  Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 and higher.

- Parent0=$(Programs) - The position on the Start Menu where the group is to be
  created. Groups can only be created on either the $(Start Menu) or
  $(Programs) macro installation point.

- Group1=Another Group - Section name of Program Group to be created, entitled
  "Another Group."

- PrivateGroup1=True - Dictates whether the group is private or common group on
  Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 and higher.

- Parent1=$(Start Menu) - The position on the Start Menu where the group is to
  be created. Groups can only be created on either the $(Start Menu) or
  $(Programs) macro installation point.

Example of [IconGroups] and individual icon creation sections:

  [IconGroups]
  Group0=Hello
  PrivateGroup0=True
  Parent0=$(Programs)
  Group1=Another Group
  PrivateGroup1=True
  Parent1=$(Start Menu)

  [Hello]
  Icon1="Hello.exe"
  Title1=Hello
  StartIn1=$(AppPath)

  [Another Group]
  Icon1="Another.exe"
  Title1=Another Icon
  StartIn1=$(AppPath)

Setup
-----

The Setup section contains information on the application being installed:

- Title=Hello - This allows for customization of the title shown on the blue
  backdrop during the installation.

- DefaultDir=$(ProgramFiles)\Hello - Where the default installation path is
  set.

- AppExe=Hello.exe - Main application being installed.

- AppToUninstall=Hello.exe - Main application to be uninstalled.

  NOTE: Another valid entry in this section is ForceUseDefDir=1, which would
  instruct the setup program to not prompt the user to select or modify the
  installation path. The path in the DefaultDir entry would be used to install
  the application.

Example of [Setup] section:

  [Setup]
  Title=Hello
  DefaultDir=$(ProgramFiles)\Hello
  AppExe=Hello.exe
  AppToUninstall=Hello.exe

Setup1 Files
------------

This section is identical to the [BootStrap Files] section in usage. The
difference is that the files listed here are installed by the second portion of
the installation, Setup1.vbp, and consist of the specific files necessary to run
the application.

Example of [Setup1 Files] section:

  [Setup1 Files]
  File1=@Hello.exe,$(AppPath),,,6/17/98 11:58:25 AM,16384,1.0.0.0
  ; The following lines may be deleted in order to obtain extra
  ; space for customizing this file on a full installation diskette.
  ;
  ; XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

In the example above, most of the excess lines of X's have been removed to save
space. In a true Setup.lst, the "X" lines pad the length of the Setup.lst file
by about 5K. The extra length is used when the Package and Deployment Wizard
determines which files will fit onto a diskette. After the installation package
is prepared, the Setup.lst file can be customized by overwriting or deleting the
X-padded lines. This assures that customizations will not make the setup files
too large to fit onto the diskette.
