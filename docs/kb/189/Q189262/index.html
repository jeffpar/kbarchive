-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Internet Information Server FTP service includes a passive mode command
(PASV) to request that the server wait for a connection instead of initiating
one after receiving a transfer command. Certain situations using multiple
passive connections may result in errors, problems with system performance as
well as denial of service situations for both the Web and FTP services.

Server Administrators will see the following error in the System Event Log:

  FTP Server could not create a client worker thread for user at host
  &lt;IPAddress&gt;. The connection to this user is terminated. The data is
  the error.

Clients accessing either the WEB or FTP services may see a message similar to one
of the following:

- Connection closed by remote host

- The FTP session was terminated

CAUSE
=====

When multiple passive connections are made at the same time to a single FTP
server it is possible to use up all available system threads for servicing
clients. Any additional connection requests will result in the errors listed
above until a client thread is available again.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


NOTE: The fix for a bug in the W3 and FTP Performance Monitor ALSO fixes the
problem described in this article. If you plan to use the Performance Monitor,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q185349 : Problems Remotely Accessing W3 or FTP Perfmon Counters

To resolve this problem, download and install one of the following fixes or wait
for the next Windows NT service pack.

Intel Platforms
---------------

IIS 4.0:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/iis/iis-public/fixes/usa/security/iis4-ftpfix/ftpfix4i.exe

IIS 3.0 and IIS 2.0:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/iis/iis-public/fixes/usa/security/iis3-ftpfix/ftpfix3i.exe

Alpha Platforms
---------------

IIS 4.0:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/iis/iis-public/fixes/usa/security/iis4-ftpfix/ftpfix4a.exe

IIS 3.0 and IIS 2.0:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/iis/iis-public/fixes/usa/security/iis3-ftpfix/ftpfix3a.exe

NOTE: Each of the above URLs above is one path; it has been wrapped for
readability.

NOTE: You might also consider running the WEB and FTP services on separate
servers to further decrease the possibility of attacks against multiple
services.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q189271 : Minimal services to run on a secure IIS Server

NOTE: This fix limits the denial of service attack and lessens it's severity.
However, there will still be a limited effect on the operation of the FTP
server. Clients that use PASV mode connections to connect to the FTP server may
be denied service and clients that are uploading information to the FTP server
may be denied service. If this attack occurs, there will be many event log
entries of the type shown below. The event log entries will give the user name
of the attacker and the IP address that originated the attack. This will enable
the attacked machine's owner to deny the user or originating site access to the
FTP server.

Event Log Entries:

1. Passive connect from user %1 at host %2 timed out. If you are seeing a large
  number of these events, you may be experiencing a denial of service attack.
  See http://www.microsoft.com/security for more information.

2. File received from user %1 at host %2 timed out. If you are seeing a large
  number of these events, you may be experiencing a denial of service attack.
  See http://www.microsoft.com/security for more information.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this problem could result in some degree of
security vulnerability in the Microsoft products listed at the beginning of this
