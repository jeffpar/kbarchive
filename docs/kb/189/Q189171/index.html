SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a WinSock application on a Windows NT computer, one or more of the
following symptoms may occur:

- If a WinSock 1.1 application sets the SO_OPENTYPE sockopt, or a WinSock 2.0
  application does not specify WSA_FLAG_OVERLAPPED to WSASocket(), the socket
  handle returned by WSPSocket() is supposed to be non-overlapped, and usable
  by ReadFile/Writefile etc. If a layered service provider (LSP) is installed,
  the non-overlapped flag is ignored and all sockets created are overlapped.
  This causes any application that uses file I/O calls to hang or fail.

- When sending a 4 KB packet over NetBEUI followed by a receive packet, the 4
  KB send returns success, but does not make it to the remote end and the
  subsequent receive fails with c000013b or error code 1726
  (RPC_S_CALL_FAILED). This happens with or without security, and only with
  buffers greater than or equal to 4 KB.

- When running a script with the WinSock function AfdAllocateMdlChain, when
  WSASend bufferPointer is set to NULL and/or bufferLength is set to zero (0),
  WSARecv and WSARecvFrom return SUCCESS but report that they transferred zero
  bytes even though there is data available to be received. This call should
  not succeed with the amount of data available to be transferred. WSASend and
  WSASendTo return WSAEFAULT, which is correct behavior.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
