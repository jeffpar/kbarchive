The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Active Server Components, version 5.0 
- Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
- Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Packs 1, 2, 3

SYMPTOMS
========

While attempting to log on to a Microsoft Exchange Server mailbox using the
Outlook Web Access (OWA) client, you may receive the following error messages:

  Failed to get inbox.

-or-

  OWA was unable to get to your inbox.

CAUSE
=====

The specified alias or user name may not be unique within the Microsoft Exchange
Global Address List. Permutations of ambiguity include any Last Name, First
Last, or Alias entered in the logon screen that is equal to any of the following
for any other mailbox:

  Last Name, First Last, or Alias

For example: John Doe [alias jdoe] and Joseph Doenfron [alias doe]. If Joseph
enters his alias in the logon screen, it will return one of the above errors
because of the ambiguity of his alias with John's last name as the server
attempts to resolve them.

This can occur if you join one or more sites that contain multiple users with the
same alias or display name. If an ambiguous (non-unique) name is detected, then
Microsoft Exchange Server is unable to resolve the name to a specific mailbox,
and the above error messages are returned.

WORKAROUND
==========

In Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0, it is only possible to log on with the
OWA client using an alias name. Therefore, the only resolution is to use unique
alias names for users in the Microsoft Exchange Server organization.

In Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 and later, it is possible to enter the
following fields for the user's mailbox:

  Alias              jamessmith
  Last Name          Smith
  First Last         James Smith
  Last First         Smith James
  Last, First        Smith, James
  user@domain.com    jamessmith@microsoft.com

For example, if a user's alias name is not unique, they can enter their SMTP
address. This value is more likely to be unique and provides for a greater
chance of resolution, which will allow the user to access their mailbox.
