-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When trying to setup a Visual Basic 5.0 application onto a server that has the
Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack installed, the application setup may fail with
following error:

  Failure to register dll. 0x8000ffff

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack set the Read-only attribute of the MSVBVM50.dll
file to True.

RESOLUTION
==========

To solve this problem, remove the Read-only attribute from MSVBVM50.dll on the
server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some users have been unable to install their Visual Basic 5.0 applications
because there was already a copy of Msvbvm50.dll on the system, and its file
attributes were set to Read-only. This problem is caused during Windows NT 4.0
Option Pack Installation.

The following information from the Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack RELEASE
NOTES UPDATE Web page describes the problem:

  VISUAL BASIC 5.0 RUN-TIME DLL CARRIES READ ONLY ATTRIBUTE Under some
  conditions during Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack installation, the Microsoft
  Visual Basic development system 5.0 run-time dynamic-link library (DLL)
  (MSVBVM50.dll) is marked with the Read-only file attribute. This causes
  errors when running any setup program created by the Visual Basic Setup
  Wizard, or in some cases causes an error with Visual Basic-created components
  that are downloaded into a browser.
