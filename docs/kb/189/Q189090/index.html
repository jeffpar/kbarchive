-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Age of Empires, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you drag your pointer to build a wall in Age of Empires, your villagers may
build the wall in the opposite direction from the direction in which you dragged
the pointer. In addition, the wall may extend to the far side of the map.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when you attempt to build a wall if you drag the pointer
into the black border that surrounds the game screen.

RESOLUTION
==========

This issue is resolved by the Microsoft Age of Empires 1.0c update file.

For additional information about how to obtain this update file, click the
article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q250837 AOE: Age of Empires Update Is Available

To work around this problem, when you build a wall, do not drag the pointer into
the black border that surrounds the game screen.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Age of Empires
versions 1.0, 1.0a, and 1.0b.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before your workers finish building a section of wall, you can delete it. To
delete a section of wall before your villager finish building it, click the
section of wall, and then press DELETE. The building site disappears, and the
game returns half of the materials used to build the wall to your stockpile.
