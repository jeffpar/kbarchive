SUMMARY
=======

The Visual C++ documentation shows an incorrect syntax for setting the
ActiveConfiguration and ActiveProject properties. For example, the following
macro written in Visual Basic Scripting Edition:

     ActiveProject = "MyProjectName"

causes the following run-time error:

  Unable to write read-only property.

This error gives the impression that the property is read-only which is not the
case. Use the following syntax instead:

     Set ActiveProject = Projects("MyProjectName")

MORE INFORMATION
================

The ActiveProject property
--------------------------

The ActiveProject Property topic in the Visual C++ documentation (see REFERENCES
section) incorrectly shows the syntax for setting the ActiveProject property. It
states:

     object.ActiveProject [=string]

where object is an expression that evaluates to an Application object and string
is the name of the project minus any file extension. When you access the
ActiveProject property of the Application object, you can omit object because
the name of the Application object is implied when you access its properties and
methods.

If you use the following VBScript macro:

     ActiveProject = "MyProjectName"

the following error occurs:

  Unable to write read-only property.

This error gives the impression that the property is read-only which is not the
case. Use the following syntax for setting the ActiveProject property instead:

     Set ActiveProject = Projects(string)

where string is the name of a project contained in the current workspace minus
any file extension. It is case sensitive.

The following is an alternative syntax:

     Set ActiveProject = Projects.Item(n)

where n is an integer from 1 to the total number of projects in the current
workspace.

Another alternative is:

     Set ActiveProject = prj

where prj is a variable already set to a project object.

The ActiveConfiguration property
--------------------------------

The ActiveConfiguration Property topic in the Visual C++ documentation (see
REFERENCES section) incorrectly shows the syntax for setting the
ActiveConfiguration property. It states:

     object.ActiveConfiguration [=string]

where object is an expression that evaluates to an Application object and string
is the name of a valid configuration in the active project. When you access the
ActiveConfiguration property of the Application object, you can omit object
because the name of the Application object is implied when you access its
properties and methods.

If you use the following VBScript macro:

     ActiveConfiguration = "MyConfiguration"

the following error occurs:

  Unable to write read-only property.

This error gives the impression that the property is read-only which is not the
case. Use the following syntax for setting the ActiveConfiguration property:

     Set ActiveConfiguration = ActiveProject.Configurations(n)

where n is an integer from 1 to the total number of configurations in the active
project.

An alternative syntax is:

     Set ActiveConfiguration = ActiveProject.Configurations.Item(n)

where n is an integer from 1 to the total number of configurations in the active
project.

Another alternative is:

     Set ActiveConfiguration = config

where config is a variable already set to a configuration object.
