SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start Baseball 3D, you may receive a message stating that
the game runs better if you update your video driver to the version of the
driver on the Baseball 3D CD-ROM. If you click Continue, you receive an ATI
Windows 98 Driver Conflict dialog box suggesting you update your ATI Rage series
video driver. If you click Ignore, the screen flashes black and you are returned
to the Windows desktop.

If you click More Information when you receive the message stating that the game
runs better if you update your video driver to the version of the driver on the
Baseball 3D CD-ROM, instructions for installing the updated ATI Rage series
video driver are displayed. If you follow the instructions to update the driver,
the issue is not resolved. The screen still flashes black, and the game does not
start.

driver from either the Microsoft or the ATI Web site.
