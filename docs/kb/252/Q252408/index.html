IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to stop the W3SVC service using the Services in the Control Panel,
the following error message occurs:

  The World Wide Web Publishing Service service could not be stopped

You may also see this error if you attempt to use the command line command "net
stop w3svc" (without the quotation marks):

  Error 2186: The service is not responding to the control function

In the task list, you can see that the Inetinfo.exe process still exists. You
cannot restart W3SVC without stopping the InetInfo.exe process first.

CAUSE
=====

When shutting down, the W3SVC service first tries to close all existing TCP/IP
client sessions. For each pending connection, the W3SVC shutdown code waits
until the "active" user requests are finished. When all TCP/IP sessions have
been closed, W3SVC can then shut down all running ISAPI applications.

If a Web client has a file download in progress and does not read the entire
server response, then the TCP connection cannot be closed quickly and the W3SVC
cannot shut down in the timeframe registered with the Windows NT Service Control
Manager (SCM). This time is 120 seconds by default. The Windows NT SCM then
displays the error message.


RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The fix forces the closure of the TCP/IP sockets when the W3SVC service is
ending. However, because IIS 4.0 allows an ISAPI application to process a
request on an arbitrary thread, there is no way to notify these threads to shut
down. The new registry parameter "mSecWAMTimeoutLoop" has been added to allow
these threads to finish their work properly. The parameter below must be
manually added to the following registry key:

  
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3svc\Parameters
  Value name    : mSecWAMTimeoutLoop (ms)
  Value type    : REG_DWORD
  Default value : 200 ms

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
If some ISAPI requests are still executing, WAM shutdown will wait a maximum of
10*mSecWAMTimeoutLoop milliseconds before shutting down.
