- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you disconnect and reconnect a modem cable and a you receive a call within a
few seconds, the RAS service could lose the COM port. Other calls coming over
that COM port are not answered by the RAS service.

These problems also occur on RRAS.

A RAS client (X.25) connects and disconnects in the middle of the call, after a
few tries RAS Service loses the COM port and does not receive any calls.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if your computer has other kernel mode drivers that do COM
port emulation.

RAS/RRAS does not check if a call is in progress when posting a listen command.
