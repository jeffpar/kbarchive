-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the reasons that the Inbox Manager does not update
permissions on client access point (CAP) folders after you upgrade Systems
Management Server (SMS) version 2.0 Released to Manufacturing (RTM) to SMS
Service Pack 1 (SP1).

MORE INFORMATION
================

After the CAP and inboxes are created, the Inbox Manager does not reset the
share and folder permissions in the CAP. The only time that the permissions are
set is when the CAP is created or being re-created (for example, the Inbox
Manager detects that the CAP or inbox folders are missing).

The administrator can modify the default permissions if they need to be changed.

In SMS version 2.0 (RTM), the CAP share permissions had been configured as:

+-------------------------------+
| Administrators | Full Control | 
+-------------------------------+
| Users          | Change       | 
+-------------------------------+
| Guests         | Change       | 
+-------------------------------+

In SMS SP1, SMS Service Pack 2 (SP2), and Service Pack 3 (SP3), the share
permissions changed to Everyone - Full Control.

In SMS version 2.0, the \Cap_xxx folder had the same NTFS file system permissions
as the share.

In SMS SP1, the \Cap_xxx folder permissions changed to:

+-------------------------------+
| Administrators | Full Control | 
+-------------------------------+
| Users          | Read         | 
+-------------------------------+
| Guests         | Read         | 
+-------------------------------+

In SMS SP2 and SMS SP3, the \Cap_xxx folder permissions have been modified to:

+-----------------------------------+
| Administrators | Full Control     | 
+-----------------------------------+
| Users          | Read and Execute | 
+-----------------------------------+
| Guest          | Read and Execute | 
+-----------------------------------+

The following folders: \Clicomp.box, \Clidata.box, \Clifiles.box, \Offerinf.box,
and \Pkginfo.box in the CAP folder are configured with Read NTFS permissions for
SMS RTM version and SMS SP1.

The following folders: \Clicomp.box, \Clidata.box, \Clifiles.box, \Offerinf.box,
and \Pkginfo.box in the CAP folder are configured with Read and Execute NTFS
permissions for SMS SP2 and SMS SP3.

The following folders: \Ccr.box, \Ddr.box, \Inventry.box, \Sinv.box, and
\Statmsgs.box had been set to Change NTFS permissions in SMS version 2.0, but
the folders have been modified to Special Access permissions (Read, Write, and
Execute) in SMS SP1, SMS SP2, and SMS SP3.
