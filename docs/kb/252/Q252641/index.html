SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the Windows NT Option Pack (NTOP) on a clustered server with
newer versions of the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC)
present, the following MSDTC event may occur:

  Source: Service Control Manager Event ID: 7024 Description: The MSDTC service
  terminated with service-specific error 3221229574.

CAUSE
=====

MSDTC version conflicts can occur during the NTOP installation on a clustered
server. The NTOP installs an older version of the MSDTC. If the clustered server
has Windows NT Service Pack 4 or later, the NTOP installation may fail and the
MSDTC may not function correctly after the installation. When SQL Server is
installed prior to the NTOP, similar problems with the MSDTC may occur.

If one of the following situations describes your problem, use the steps in the
"Workaround" section of this article.

- The NTOP cannot be installed because Windows NT SP4 or later is installed on
  the system.

- The NTOP is installed, but the MSDTC resources fail under Cluster
  Administrator.

- SQL Server and the NTOP are both installed on a clustered server and the
  MSDTC is the only resource failing.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. Remove the MSDTC resource group from cluster server.

2. Delete the following registry keys on the MSDTC:

  HKLM\software\Microsoft\MSDTC

  and

  HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSDTC

3. Remove the shared MSDTCLog folder on the shared drive.

4. Install the standalone version of the MSDTC from the following location:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/distapps/MTS/Public-Fixes/usa/DTC/SvcPack/

5. Stop and restart the cluster services on both nodes in the following order:

  a. Stop CLSSVC on node B

  b. Stop CLSSVC on node A

  c. Start CLSSVC on node A

  d. Start CLSSVC on node B

6. Test failover of the MSDTC group. If it works, the workaround was successful.

7. If the errors persist, use the DTCremove utility (not supported), and then
  run DTCSetup.exe again as described above.

8. If SQL Server is installed, you may need to remove SQL Server first.

Note: For servers with SP5 installed prior to the NTOP installation, a fix for
the MSDTC installation is provided. For additional information on MSDTC
installation instructions, click the article number below to view the article in
