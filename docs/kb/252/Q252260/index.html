SUMMARY
=======

If you send mail by using Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) and you perform a
Check Name operation, OWA resolves the name only against entries in the global
address list. Any entries that are in the Contacts folders, the personal address
book (PAB), or other Microsoft Outlook Address Books are ignored.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Microsoft Outlook, when you compose a new mail message, you can type the
names of the recipients and perform a Check Name operation to resolve these
names. If you have a PAB and one or more Contacts folders that are defined as
Outlook Address Books, Outlook resolves these names in a specific order that can
be altered by the user. For additional information, click the article numbers
below to view the articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q237945 OL2000: (CW) How to Specify a Particular Address Book

  Q147400 XCLN: How the Check Names Command Works

If you use a browser to access an OWA server and compose a new mail message, you
can still perform a Check Name operation. In this case, however, the names are
resolved against only the entries in the global address list and not against the
entries in other Outlook Address Books that you may have defined.
