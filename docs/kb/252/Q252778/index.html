IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

If Host Account Manager (UDConfig.exe) was installed using the SNA Windows 95 or
Windows 98 client on either a Windows NT Workstation or computer running Windows
95 or Windows 98, the following error may appear after running this
configuration tool.

  Unable to locate Windows NT Account Synchronization Service in the target
  Windows NT domain. To browse other domains, use the "Select Domain" option of
  the "File" menu.

CAUSE
=====

When Host Account Manager is initially installed, you are asked for the Windows
NT Domain Name that contains the master database (MDB) where the Host Account
Cache (HAC) resides. If the domain name was inadvertently misspelled or the
wrong domain name was used (where no HAC is installed), end users would receive
this message after running Host Account Manager.

RESOLUTION
==========

The MdbDomain Registry value must be edited to indicate the correct Windows NT
domain name. This value allows the client to find where the MDB cache is
stored.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To edit the Registry value:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedit.exe).

2. Locate the MdbDomain value under the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SNA Server\CurrentVersion\HostSecurity\STI\Client

  NOTE: This Registry key is one path; it may appear wrapped for readability.

3. On the Edit menu, click modify. In the Value data field, type the correct
  Windows NT domain name and click ok.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Host Account Manager is a configuration tool that gives an end user the ability
to add or change his or her own cached entries (user ID and/or password) in a
host security domain.

The problem described in this article only occurs where the Microsoft SNA Windows
95 or Windows 98 Host Account Manager client is installed on a Windows NT
Workstation or computer running Windows 95 or Windows 98.

If you install the Microsoft SNA Windows NT Host Account Manager client on a
Windows NT Workstation, you are never prompted for the dialog box asking for the
location of the Windows NT domain name where the MDB resides. Instead, the SNA
Windows NT client knows where to get the MDB just by knowing what Windows NT
domain you are logged on to. In addition to this, there will be no Registry
entry if the SNA Windows NT Host Account Manager client is installed on a
Windows NT Workstation computer.
