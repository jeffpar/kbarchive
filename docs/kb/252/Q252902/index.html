-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5, on platform(s):
   - the hardware: DEC Alpha 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) or later on an
Alpha computer that is running Exchange Server 5.5, you may experience a Dr.
Watson crash in the information store.

CAUSE
=====

Starting in Windows NT 4.0 SP4, there are changes in the heap manager that may
prevent the information store from allocating memory that it had previously
freed.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), and locate the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File
  Execution Options

2. Click the Image File Execution Options key, and then click Add Key from the
  Edit menu to create a new key with the name "store.exe" (without the
  quotation marks). You can leave the Class field blank. This Key Name entry
  should not include a path, only the name of the executable itself.

3. Click the new key you created in step 2, and then click Add Value from the
  Edit menu to create the Value Name: DisableHeapLookaside and Data Type:
  REG_SZ.

4. Click OK, and then type "1" (without the quotation marks) in the String
  field.

  Summary for the above entries:

  Key Name: store.exe
  Class:

  Value Name: DisableHeapLookaside
  Data Type: REG_SZ
  String: 1

5. You do not usually need to restart the system to see the results. You can
  usually simply restart the Exchange Server information store because this
  registry value is inspected during each process initialization. However, you
  may need to restart the computer to properly restart the information store.
