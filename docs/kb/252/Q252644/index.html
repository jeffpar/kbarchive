-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to print from your Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server
edition-based client computer to a printer configured locally on the Terminal
Server (such as LPT1), you may receive the following error message on the
Terminal Server console (or the client assigned to session zero):

  Error writing to LPT1: for Document &lt;print job name&gt;: The device is not
  ready.
  Do you wish to retry or cancel the job

NOTE: The error message must be cleared on the console (or the client assigned to
session zero) before the spooler will continue printing any queued requests.
This error message will not occur on the client computer that requested the
print job.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if there was an incorrect check to determine which
Windows-based computer actually has a direct connection to the local printer.
