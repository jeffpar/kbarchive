SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a program on your Windows 95-based computer, the program may be

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you are running the released version of Windows 95
instead of Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 or later. The component to query
SMART capabilities of IDE drives was first included with Windows 95 OEM Service
Release 2.
