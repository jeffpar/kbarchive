The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server 4.0 (all service packs) and Host Integration Server 2000 allow
multiple SNA Server services (Snaservr.exe) to be installed and configured to
provide for increased session capacity. However, the additional SNA Server
services cannot be configured to use specific software ports in environments
that implement Internet firewalls. Therefore, the default ports listed here are
used by the additional SNA Server services:

+--------------------------------------------+
| Port          | TCP/IP | IPX/SPX | Vines   | 
+--------------------------------------------+
| SnaServerPort | 1477   | 0x84C9  | Dynamic | 
+--------------------------------------------+

CAUSE
=====

The ability to configure the software ports used by the additional SNA Server
services was not implemented in SNA Server 4.0 or Host Integration Server 2000.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 4.0
--------------

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server versions
4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4, and Host Integration Server 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following Microsoft Knowledge Base article describes how to configure SNA
Server and Host Integration Server 2000 to use specific software port numbers
for environments that implement Internet firewalls:

  Q139508 Internet Firewall Support in SNA Server

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Article Q139508 describes how to change the port used by the primary SNA Server
service (Snaservr.exe) by setting a registry entry called SnaServerPort.

After applying the fixes described in this article, the additional SNA Server
services can be configured to use specific software ports by adding the
following registry entries:

- SnaServer2Port

- SnaServer3Port

- SnaServer4Port

These entries are added in the same location as the SnaServerPort entry for the
primary SNA Server service. See Q139508 for additional detail.
