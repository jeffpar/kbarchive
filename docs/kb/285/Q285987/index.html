SYMPTOMS
========

When you have a document that contains a picture or other object, the picture
may not appear. This problem may occur for a picture, graphic, AutoShape, or
other object.


CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Word documents consist of separate text and drawing layers. When a
picture or object is inserted in a Word document as "Float over text", it is
inserted in the drawing layer. Word does not display the drawing layer when you
view the document in master document view, normal view, or outline view.

Page layout, online layout, and print preview are the only views in which Word
can display the drawing layers of a Word document. Because "Float over text"
pictures and objects reside in a drawing layer, they are only visible in page
layout view, online layout view, and print preview.

The problem described in the "Symptoms" section can occur for the following
reasons:

  
  The picture or object is formatted as "Float over text", and you are viewing your Word document in normal, outline, or master document view.

  The picture or object is formatted as "Float over text", you are viewing your Word document in page layout or online layout view, and the Drawings option is turned off.

  The picture or object is formatted as "Float over text", and the "Drawing objects" option is turned off. This problem occurs when you either print your Word document or view it in print preview.

  The picture or object is formatted as "inline", and the "Draft output" option is turned on. This problem occurs when you either print your Word document
  or view it in print preview.

  The picture or object is formatted as "inline", and the "Picture placeholders" option is turned on.
