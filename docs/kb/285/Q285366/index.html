-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3, 5.5 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

An Exchange Server client or Exchange Server administrator may notice a delay in
the arrival of new messages. If you use Task Manager or Microsoft Windows NT
Performance Monitor to examine the Exchange Server computer more closely, the
information store process CPU utilization is between 90 and 100 percent and the
message transfer agent (MTA) work queue to the private information store
continues to grow.

If you use Performance Monitor to look at each individual thread for the
information store process (Store.exe), a series of threads is each consuming a
portion of the total CPU time. The MTA queue in the Exchange Server
Administrator program may also show many messages with the same MTS-ID that are
waiting to be delivered to the private information store.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if a user sends a message or meeting request to multiple
recipients who are on multiple Exchange Server computers, and the user requests
a delivery receipt or read receipt. As each copy of the message is received, the
Exchange Server computer sends back the delivery receipt or read receipt (as
applicable). Some or all of these delivery receipts or read receipts arrive back
at the originator's home server at approximately the same time, which causes
several of these messages to be adjacent in the processing order of the MTA
queue. The MTA then attempts to deliver the delivery receipts or read receipts
to the database a few at a time. At this point, Store.exe attempts to associate
the delivery receipt or read receipt with the original message in the
originator's mailbox.

For example, four copies of the same delivery receipt or read receipt might be
delivered at the same time. Because all four messages are attempting to locate
the same message, the messages are all simultaneously trying to navigate the
same pages in the database to locate the original message.


RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Apply it only to
computers that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive
additional testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Exchange Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The typical support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: JET

+-------------------------+
| File name | Version     | 
+-------------------------+
| Ese.dll   | 5.5.2654.91 | 
+-------------------------+



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem if it occurs with delivery receipts and read
receipts in conjunction with sending mail to a distribution list (DL), set the
"do not send any reports back to someone who requests them" option. On new
distribution lists, the "Report to Message Originator" option is enabled by
default. If you are experiencing this problem, consider disabling the "Report to
Message Originator" option on any DLs if a delivery receipt or read receipt is
not necessary. This option keeps users who automatically request delivery
receipts or read receipts from getting flooded with receipts when those users
accidentally request receipts when sending a message to a DL.

To disable the "Report to Message Originator" option on a DL, in the Exchange
Server Administrator program, click to clear the "Report to Message Originator"
check box on the Advanced tab of the DL.

NOTE: When the "Hide Membership From Address Book" option is selected, the
"Report to Message Originator" option is overridden to ensure the secrecy of the
member list of the DL.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
