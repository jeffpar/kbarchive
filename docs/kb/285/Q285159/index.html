SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to create a virtual directory in Internet Information
Services (IIS) 5.0 to connect to a Novell NetWare share.

To gain access to the NetWare File System, IIS must pass credentials with the
appropriate permissions for the databases that you are attempting to access. By
default, IIS attempts to pass credentials for the IUSR_MachineName account.

NOTE: The IUSR_MachineName account appears as though it is being used by IIS 5.0
Web sites that are running out of process. However, the IWAM_Machine Name
account impersonates the IUSR_MachineName account. Therefore, the IUSR account
is the only account discussed in the following resolution.

NetWare uses the NetWare Directory Service to authenticate users to its servers.
To access any file systems, a legitimate account for the credentials that are
being passed must exist on the NetWare server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To access the Novell NetWare 5 shares running only TCP/IP, perform the following
steps exactly:

1. On the IIS computer that is attempting to communicate with Novell, install
  the Novell NetWare Client for Microsoft Windows NT (Required). During setup,
  choose a custom installation, choose to install into an NDS system, and only
  choose IP for the protocol. Do not install Workstation Manager.

2. On the computer running IIS 5.0, open Control Panel, double-click
  Administrative Tools, double-click Computer Management, click to expand Local
  Users and Groups, double-click Users, right-click the IUSR_Machine Name
  account, and then click Set Password. Change the password, save it, and then
  close the Computer Management console.

3. In the Internet Services Manager, do the following:

  a. Right-click the server name (for example, MYWEB01) under Internet
     Information Services.

  b. Click the Edit button next to WWW to open the master properties.

  c. On the Directory Security tab, click the Edit button next to Anonymous and
     Authentication methods.

  d. On the Authentication Methods tab, click Edit under the Anonymous section
     to open the Anonymous User properties.

  e. Click to uncheck the option for IIS to control the password, and then
     enter the password that you changed in step 2.

4. Open the NetWare Administrator located in the sys: volume in the Public\WIN32
  folder of the NetWare 5 Server. In the root of the container where the server
  exists, create an IUSR_Machine Name account that is identical to the one on
  the Windows NT Server computer. In the properties for that user, click
  Password Restrictions, and then make sure that only the Require password
  option is checked. Click Set Password, and then set the password to that of
  the Windows NT account. Do not require passwords to be changed on the NetWare
  system.

  NOTE: This is the most crucial step to the entire process.

5. In the NetWare Administrator, open the properties for the newly created IUSR,
  click the Rights to files and directories tab, and then add the appropriate
  permissions to the database files that need to be accessed. Give at least
  Read permissions, unless changes will be made through the Internet, which
  requires all permissions except Supervisor and Access Control.

NOTE: After you add the virtual directory in IIS, you may see a red stop sign
with the word "Error" inside. This warning appears because IIS does not support
the UNC connection to a computer in a domain that does not have a trust
relationship with the domain in which the IIS server resides.
