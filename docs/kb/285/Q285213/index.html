SYMPTOMS
========

When you play Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 2, you may experience one or
more of the following symptoms:

- Stuttering sounds.

- Chirping or clicking sounds.

- Distorted sounds.

- The video frame rate drops when you fire your guns.

- The video frame rate is slow or choppy.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if your sound card is not compatible with the process
that converts the game sounds to mono sound.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, use the following methods in the order in which they
are presented.

Increase the Sound Playback Quality
-----------------------------------

To increase the sound playback quality:

1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click "Files or Folders".

2. In the Named box, type the following line:

3. In the "Look in" box, click My Computer, and then click Find Now.

4. Double-click the Cfs2.cfg file.

5. In the "Choose the program you want to use" box, click Notepad.

6. Click to clear the "Always use this program to open this file" check box, and
  then click OK.

7. Scroll to the [SOUND] section and change the BitsPerSample=, the Channels=,
  and the SamplesPerSec= lines to match the following code:

  [SOUND]
  Channels=2
  SamplesPerSec=22050
  BitsPerSample=16

NOTE: You can use either one of the following values for the SamplesPerSec=
line:
   - 22050

8. On the File menu, click Exit. When you are prompted to save the changes,
  click Yes.

9. Restart Combat Flight Simulator 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To increase compatibility with game controllers, the sound settings in Combat
Flight Simulator 2 use 11Khz, 8-bit, and mono sound as the default values for
the sound settings.

These default values were chosen because many sound cards are unable to fully
process game controller signals and high quality game sounds at the same time.
