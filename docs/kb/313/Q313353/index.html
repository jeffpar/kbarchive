-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) is the minimum
requirement for supporting Microsoft Windows XP Professional-based computers as
clients.

Not all versions of Windows XP are supported, nor do all versions of SMS support
Windows XP.

MORE INFORMATION
================

- Earlier service packs for SMS 2.0, including Service Pack 2 (SP2), do not
  support Windows XP Professional as a client.

- SMS 1.2 does not support Windows XP as a client.

- No version of SMS supports Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition as a client.

- 64-bit versions of Windows XP are not currently supported as SMS 2.0 clients
  in either 32-bit or 64-bit mode.

- No version of SMS currently supports Microsoft Windows XP Embedded as a
  client.

- Additional Quick Fix Engineering (QFE) updates or hotfixes may also be
  required for Windows XP-based clients.


SMS components that are fully supported with no qualifications include:

  Client Installation
  Hardware Inventory
  Software Inventory
  Network Monitor

The following SMS components are supported with some qualifications:

- Software Distribution - When it is initially installed, SP3 Software
  Distribution cannot target Windows XP-based client computers. This occurs
  because Windows XP is not recognized by Windows Management Instrumentation
  (WMI). To add Windows XP to the list of operating systems that SMS uses to
  target software distribution, install the SP3 hotfix that is described in the
  following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q308271 How to Add Windows XP Professional As a Target Platform to SMS 2.0
  SP3

- Remote Tools - This feature is supported on SMS clients that run Windows XP
  with a new accelerated video driver. This driver is delivered when the client
  is upgraded to SP3 or when an SP3 client is initially installed. The Remote
  Tools feature is supported by using the RLE compression method instead of the
  default LZH compression method.


- Software Metering - There is limited support for software metering of Windows
  XP. SMS cannot perform software metering of 16-bit programs on a Windows
  XP-based client.
