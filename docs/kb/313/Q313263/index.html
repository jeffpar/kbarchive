SYMPTOMS
========

After you enter the schoolroom, the sound may stop working.

CAUSE
=====

In the Device Manager, under "Sound, video, and game controllers", the Unimodem
Half-Duplex Audio Device is enabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

Disable the Unimodem Half-Duplex Audio Device. To do this, follow these steps.

NOTE: Because there are several versions of Windows, the following steps may be
different on your computer. If they are, please consult your product
documentation to complete these steps.

1. On the taskbar, click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. In Control Panel, double-click System.

3. In the System Properties dialog box, click the Device Manager tab.

4. Click the plus sign (+) to the left of "Sound, video, and game controllers"
  to expand the directory tree.

5. Under "Sound, video, and game controllers", click Unimodem Half-Duplex Audio
  Device, and then click Properties.

6. In the "Unimodem Half-Duplex Audio Device Properties" dialog box, click to
  select the "Disable in this hardware profile" check box, and then click OK
  twice.

For Windows 2000:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. In Control Panel, double-click System.

3. In the System Properties dialog box, on the Hardware tab, then click Device
  Manager.

4. In the window that opens, click the plus sign (+) to expand the left of
  "Sound, video, and game controllers" directory tree.

5. Click "Unimodem Half-Duplex Audio Device", and then click Properties. If not
  found, Cancel or Close the dialogues and windows you have opened and skip
  ahead to the next article.

6. In the "Unimodem Half-Duplex Audio Device Properties" dialog box, click to
  select the "Disable in this hardware profile" check box, and then click OK
  twice.

The sound now works in both versions of the Magic School Bus.
