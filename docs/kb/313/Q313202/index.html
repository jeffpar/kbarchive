-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Advanced Program-to-Program Communications (APPC) or Common Programming
Interface for Communications (CPI-C) applications that are configured to use the
Single Sign-On (SSO) feature may fail to connect to a host system if the FMH-5
(function management header) Attach message does not contain one or more of the
following subfields:

- Logical Unit of Work Identifier (LUWID) subfield

- Conversation Correlator field

- Password subfield (a subfield in the Access Security Information subfield,
  which also ordinarily includes a User ID subfield)

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server service (Snaservr.exe) fails to correctly parse short FMH-5
Attach messages. The FMH-5 Attach messages are short because they lack one or
more subfields.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 4.0

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0 service pack that contains this
fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

+---------------------------------------------+
| File name    | Date             | Time      | 
+---------------------------------------------+
| Snaservr.exe | 07-December-2001 | 7:50 A.M. | 
+---------------------------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.



Host Integration Server 2000

No fix is available for this problem in Host Integration Server 2000 at this
time.

STATUS
======

SNA Server 4.0

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 4.0, 4.0
Service Pack (SP) 1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, and 4.0 SP4.

Host Integration Server 2000

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Host Integration Server 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following are configuration settings that result in an FMH-5 Attach message
that does not include one or more of the necessary fields:

- If the APPC or CPI-C application is running on an SNA Server 4.0 client or
  SNA Server 4.0 system that is configured with registry entry "LUWIDSUP=NO",
  the APPC dynamic link library (DLL) will not ask the SNA Server service to
  generate an LUWID. The resulting FMH-5 Attach message will not include the
  Logical Unit of Work Identifier subfield.

- If an APPC or CPI-C application is designed to use a security type of AP_SAME
  or CM_SECURITY_SAME, the FMH-5 Attach message may not include the password
  subfield as part of the Access Security Information subfield.

For more information on these and other fields and parameters that are included
in FMH-5 Attach messages, see "FM Headers" in the IBM SNA Formats guide
(GA27-3136).
