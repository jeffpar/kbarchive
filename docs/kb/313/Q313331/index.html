IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs.

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) and Microsoft COM+ enable Open Database
Connectivity (ODBC) connection pooling by default. An MTS/COM+ application does
not need to explicitly enable ODBC connection pooling. However, when you use the
Microsoft ODBC Driver for DB2 that comes with Host Integration Server (HIS)
2000, you need to perform an extra configuration step to enable ODBC connection
pooling in MTS/COM+ applications.

This article assumes that you are developing MTS/COM+ components using ActiveX
Data Objects (ADO) that are registered under MTS/COM+.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MTS/COM+ components that use ADO communicate with the Microsoft ODBC Driver for
DB2 by using the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers (MSDASQL). For ODBC
connection pooling to work with the Microsoft ODBC Driver for DB2, you must turn
off OLE DB session pooling for the MSDASQL provider. With Microsoft Data Access
Components (MDAC) version 2.1 and later, OLE DB session pooling is turned on by
default.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To turn off OLE DB session pooling for MSDASQL, follow these steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the OLEDB_SERVICES value under the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{c8b522cb-5cf3-11ce-ade5-00aa0044773d}\

3. On the Edit menu, click DWORD, type "0xfffffffc" (without the quotation
  marks), and then click OK.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

NOTE: If you make this change in the registry, it affects all applications that
are using the MSDASQL provider. To avoid this, you can also set this value in
your application by adding the value OLE DB SERVICES=-4 in your connection
string to turn off OLE DB session pooling and autoenlistment. This setting turns
off these properties for the OLE DB provider, and allows the pooling and
autoenlistment to occur at the ODBC driver level.
