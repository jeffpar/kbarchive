The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a computer is installed as a Windows 95 Systems Management Server client, the
[SMS] section of the Sms.ini file will report OS=5. If the computer is then
installed as a Windows NT client without having removed the Systems Management
Server client, the following message will appear, and inventory should not be
taken on the client:

  A different OS was detected than that under which Systems Management Server
  was installed. Operating System reported by SMS.INI does not match current
  operating system.
  Exiting
  [SMS 100%]

However, Systems Management Server continues and inventory is taken anyway. One
result of this is that the NetcardID is not detected correctly. The NetcardID
changes from the proper value (inventoried under Windows 95) to
&lt;unknown&gt;.

This problem only occurs if the computer's Sms.ini file was created when the
computer is running Windows 95, and then the computer is started to Windows NT.
A dual-boot computer installed as a Windows NT Systems Management Server client,
then started to Windows 95 works as expected. Note that Systems Management
Server does not support dual-boot computers at this time.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, run Upgrade.bat from the SMS_SHR share on the
Systems Management Server logon server for those clients affected when started
to Windows NT.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2 Service Pack 2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
