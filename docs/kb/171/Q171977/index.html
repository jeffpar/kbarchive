The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you quit Microsoft Word, Word may appear to stop responding (hang).


CAUSE
=====

When you quit Microsoft Word normally, Word performs several functions. During
any of these steps, problems may occur that cause Microsoft Word to hang.

A known cause of this symptom is when the Msgsrv32.exe file does not respond to
the system. When you press CTRL+ALT+DEL to show the Windows task list, it may
show that Msgsrv32.exe has stopped responding.

Msgsrv32.exe is a Microsoft Windows dynamic-link library file that handles error
message codes for Windows-based drivers. If Msgsrv32.exe encounters an error
code that it is unable to handle, Msgsrv32.exe may stop responding.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem and quit Microsoft Word, follow these steps:

1. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE.

2. Look for Msgsrv32.exe in the Windows task list.

3. Do one of the following:

   - If Msgsrv32.exe is listed, select Msgsrv32.exe and then click End Task. If
     you receive the message "This application is not responding...", click
     Yes. Microsoft Word should finish quitting normally. To attempt to correct
     the problem, please see the articles listed in the "Resolution" section

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem is known to be related to VXD driver files. VXD driver files are
often used in creating printer and video drivers for Windows. To ensure that the
problem does not involve the video driver, set your display to use the Standard
VGA driver that is included with Windows. To ensure that the problem does not
involve the printer driver, install a printer driver that does not exist in your
system.
