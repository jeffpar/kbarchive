-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While you are working in Microsoft Word 97, a central processing unit (CPU)
usage monitor may show the CPU running at near 100 percent on some computers.

This symptom occurs even while you are performing operations that are not
perceived as CPU intensive, such as typing, running the proofing tools, or other
similar common word processing tasks.

CAUSE
=====

The Word 97 program generates many low-priority requests which keep the CPU at
near 100-percent usage. Note, however, that because these requests are
low-priority, they will yield CPU time to any process that requests it.
Therefore, this behavior will not affect your computer's performance.

WORKAROUND
==========

Word 97 Service Release 1 (SR-1) does correct some causes of 100-percent CPU
usage and will prevent 100-percent CPU usage from happening in some cases.

For additional information about SR-1, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q172475 OFF97: How to Obtain and Install MS Office 97 SR-1

If you are running the Intel Power Monitor software, you can force Word to cut
back on CPU usage by using the Fix button on the Intel Power Monitor.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Running at 100-percent CPU usage does not make Word or other programs run
slowly, because Microsoft Windows will preempt Word and give CPU time to other
programs.

If you are running Word 97 on a laptop computer, your computer may consume less
power if you use Microsoft Word 97, Service Release 1. This version of Word
allows the CPU in your computer to return to an idle state more quickly, thus
conserving battery power.

NOTE: Word will still hit 100-percent CPU usage when performing complex tasks.

of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
