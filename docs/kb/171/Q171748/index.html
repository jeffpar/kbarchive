SUMMARY
=======

The Eximwiz utility included with the Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit volume
2, ISBN 1-57231-534-2 contained a bug that produced an "expired control" error
message. This updated version of Eximwiz will correct the problem.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  Eximwiz.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/exch50/Utility/2.0/NT4ALPHA/EN-US/Eximwiz.exe)

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of

Eximwiz.exe converts Microsoft Exchange Bulk Export format (.csv) files to
Microsoft Mail import format. After creating the output file, you can use the
tool to interactively import addresses into a Mail Post Office on the network,
or you can e-mail the import file to external recipients.

In addition, new functionality enables you to export from Mail, and create a .csv
file to add Mail recipients as Microsoft Exchange custom recipients.

Eximwiz is useful when directory synchronization between a Microsoft Exchange
Server implementation and Mail is not a viable option. For example, you are
trying to populate a trading partner's Mail system with relevant addresses such
as purchasing agents, from your global address list. Eximwiz can also be used to
manually perform directory synchronization between a Microsoft Exchange Server
computer and a foreign mail switch that does not support the Mail Dirsync
protocol.

Installation Instructions
