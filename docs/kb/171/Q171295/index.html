-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

With the FirstWatch program, transition failures have been observed that require
the use of CLARiiON's Trespass utility. For example, the system may start in
Online Primary mode, but any attempt to change into Dual mode fails. The Ha.log
file contains errors that occurred while using Trespass. You may also notice
that the Scsi.exe, Clarscsi.exe, and Diskcfg.exe programs do not display LUNs
(logical unit numbers), which Trespass needs to access.

The CLARiiON Agent Service may report problems in the event log. The following
two events messages have been logged:

  ERROR: Opening Device: , 1:0:0.

  Is the device configured correctly?

After these events, attempting to select the host in ArrayGuide reports the
following error:

  Could not connect to the chassis, check device name in fw31a's agent
  configuration file.

ATF failures have also been observed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by changes in the way Windows NT handles the SCSI LUN
enumeration in Service Pack 3.

RESOLUTION
==========

Perform the following steps to resolve this problem:

1. To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
  Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
  please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


For your convenience, the English version of this post-SP3 hotfix has been posted
to the following Internet location. However, Microsoft recommends that you
install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 to correct this problem.

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/NT40/hotfixes-postSP3/scsi-fix

NOTE: Service Pack 3 must be applied to Windows NT 4.0 prior to applying this
fix.

2. WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system- wide
  problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
  Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
  Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

  Install the new Scsiport.sys and go to the following registry key:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Disk\ 

3. Add the following new value to the above registry path to activate the new
  code:

     Value Name = ScanDisconnectedDevices
     Data Type = REG_DWORD
     Data = 1


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
