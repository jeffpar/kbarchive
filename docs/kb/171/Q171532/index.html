SYMPTOMS
========

While expanding and collapsing a Watch or Locals Window and then stepping
through the code, you may see the Visual Basic IDE crash. This problem can occur
if you have a variant property that returns an object. See the MORE INFORMATION
below.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service
Pack 2.

For more information on the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 2, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q170365 INFO: Visual Studio 97 Service Packs - What, Where, and Why

For a list of the Visual Basic 5.0 bugs that were fixed in the Visual Studio 97
Service Pack 2, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new ActiveX DLL Project (Project1) in Visual Basic 5.0. Class1 is
  created by default.

2. In the General Declarations section of Class1, add the following code:

        Public Property Get Prop1() as Variant
               Set Prop1 = me
        End Property

3. From the File menu, select Add Project, and add a Standard EXE project to the
  group. This project is named Project2 by default.

4. The DLL is named Project1.dll by default. From the Project menu, select
  References, and check Project1.

5. In the load event of the default form (Form1) of Prject2, add the following
  code:

        Dim x as Class1
        Set x = New Class1
        Stop

6. Set the Standard EXE project as the Startup Project by right-clicking
  Project2 in the Project Explorer, and selecting the Set as StartUp item.

7. Run the project.

8. When the Stop statement is hit, open up the Locals Window. This can be done
  by selecting the Locals Window in the View menu. (You could also use the
  Watch window to get the same result, adding a watch on the object variable
  x.)

9. In the Locals Windows, expand the Class1 object variable x, and then expand
  the Prop1 property.

10. Collapse the branch from x.

11. Press the F8 key. The IDE will crash and you may see an error message
  indicating that an application error has occurred in VB5.exe.
