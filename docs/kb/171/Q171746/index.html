-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running Visual FoxPro under Windows 95, a class based on either a list box
or a combo box that sets the Picture property in the class, does not display the
picture either in the Form Designer when you add the class to a form, or when
you run the form. If FoxPro is running under Windows NT 4.0, the picture does
not appear in the Class Designer either.

RESOLUTION
==========

This article includes two workarounds. The first adds a new property to the
class that sets the Picture property to the new property. The second sets the
Picture property in the form after the class is added. Both methods assume that
the class has been created following steps 1-3 in the Steps to Reproduce
Behavior section below.

Method 1
--------

1. Open the class in the Visual Class Designer. Either by selecting Open from
  the File menu and then clicking Visual Class Library as the file type or
  enter the following command in the Command window:

        MODIFY CLASS list OF test.vcx

2. Create a new property for the class by selecting New Property from the Class
  menu. Enter the property name; cPicture, for example. Click Close.

3. Locate the Picture property on the Property Sheet. Copy the path to the
  graphic and file name from the Picture property and paste it to the new
  cPicture property.

4. In the Init of the class, add the following code:

        This.Picture = This.cPicture

5. Close and save the class.

6. Run the form. The picture should appear next to each row in the list.

NOTE: If any code or comments are added to the Init of the List1 class on the
form, add the DODEFAULT() statement to the Init of List1 to ensure that the
parent class Init code is also executed.

Method 2
--------

1. Create a form. Using the Form Controls Toolbar, click the View Classes button
  and select Add. Add the test class library. Click the list class and drop it
  onto the form.

2. In the Init of the form, enter code similar to the following:

     Thisform.List1.Picture = ;
     "c:\vfp5\samples\graphics\bmps\assorted\bell.bmp"

3. Save and run the form.

This method is similar to explicitly setting the Picture property of List1 of the
Property sheet to the graphic.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new class by either selecting New from File menu then selecting
  Class or enter the following code in the Command window:

        CREATE CLASS list AS listbox OF test.vcx

2. Set the Picture property of the ListBox to a graphic:

        c:\vfp5\samples\graphics\bmps\assorted\bell.bmp

  NOTE: In Windows 95, the picture is visible in the Visual Class Designer.

3. Save and close the class.

4. Create a form. Using the Form Controls toolbar, click the View Classes button
  and select Add. Add test.vcx. Click the list class and drop it onto the
  form.

  NOTE: The picture is not visible in the list class on the form.

5. Right-click on the form to display the short-cut menu, and select Data
  Environment.

6. Add the customer table from the \VFP5\Samples\Data directory, then click
  Close.

7. Change the RowSource property of List1 to customer.contact and the
  RowSourceType property to 6 - Fields.

8. Save and run the form.
