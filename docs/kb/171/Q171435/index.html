-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

POP3 users are unable to log on to a Microsoft Exchange Server computer. When
the logon attempt fails, an event 11202 is logged in the application event log.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the Microsoft Exchange Server service account does not
have the &lt;Act as part of the operating system&gt; Windows NT user right. This
only happens if the client tries to use basic (clear text) authentication.

Below is an example of the type of event you will see in the Event Viewer:

  Event ID: 11202
  Source: MSExchangePOP3
  Type: Failure Audit
  Description: Logon attempt from to has failed: HrLookupCredentials()
  call failed with error: A required privilege is not held by the client.

You can use telnet to verify that the Microsoft Exchange Server service account
is missing the &lt;Act as part of the operating system&gt; right. To test this
with telnet, perform the following steps:

1. On Windows NT or Windows 95, open a command prompt.

2. At the command prompt, type &lt;telnet [name of computer running Microsoft
  Exchange Server] 110&gt;.

You will get a connection to the computer running Microsoft Exchange Server. The
server will issue a greeting banner that may appear as:

   +OK Microsoft Exchange POP3 Server version 5.0.1457.10 ready

The sample telnet session below demonstrates how to verify that the Microsoft
Exchange Server computer is missing the required right. In this sample, lines
starting with S&gt; are sent by the server and lines starting with C&gt; were
sent by the client (telnet).

  S&gt; +OK Microsoft Exchange POP3 Server version 5.0.1457.10 ready
  C&gt; USER &lt;userid&gt;
  S&gt; +OK
  C&gt; PASS &lt;password&gt;
  S&gt; -ERR A required privilege is not held by the client.

If the Microsoft Exchange Server service account does not have the &lt;Act as
part of the operating system&gt; user right, an error will be returned after the
PASS command.

RESOLUTION
==========

To grant the appropriate right to the Microsoft Exchange Server service account,
perform the following steps:

1. Start User Manager for Domains.

2. From the Policies menu, select User Rights.

3. Select the Show Advanced User Rights check box.

4. From the list of rights, select Act as part of the operating system.

5. Select Add.

6. Select the Show Users button.

7. Select the Exchange Server service account.

8. Click Add.

9. Click OK until you have completely exited all dialog boxes.
