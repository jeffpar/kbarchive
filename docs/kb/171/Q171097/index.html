SUMMARY
=======

This article contains a sample Visual Basic for Applications macro that
calculates the number of months between two dates. This macro is useful for
determining the number of months that have passed since a particular starting
date.

The following sample Visual Basic for Applications macro calculates the number of
months between 1/23/1993 and 11/2/1993:

     Sub Date_MonthsBetweenDates()
        Dim dBeginDate As Date
        Dim dEndDate As Date
        Dim intMonths As Integer
        ' Beginning date.
        dBeginDate = DateValue("1/1/1993")
        ' Ending Date.
        dEndDate = DateValue("2/1/1993")
        ' Calculate number of months between dates.
        intMonths = ((Year(dEndDate) - Year(dBeginDate)) * 12) + _
           Month(dEndDate) - Month(dBeginDate)
        ' Display number of months.
        MsgBox Str$(intMonths) &amp; " month(s)"
     End Sub

NOTE: The number of months returned by this macro is not based on the exact
number of days between the two dates. For example, given a start date of
10/31/1993 and an end date of 11/2/1993, the macro returns one month.
