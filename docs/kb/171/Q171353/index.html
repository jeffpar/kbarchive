-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 2, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running Windows 95 on a computer with an IDE (ATA) hard disk and
controller that support Ultra DMA mode, the computer may stop responding (hang)
while the hard disk is being accessed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if there is a hardware error while data is being read
from the hard disk. When such an error occurs in Ultra DMA mode, the Windows
device driver does not successfully recover from the error and retry the
operation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service
Release 2 (OSR2). An update to address this problem is now available, but is not
fully regression-tested and should be applied only to computers experiencing
this specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific
problem, Microsoft does not recommend implementing this update at this time.

This issue is resolved by the following updated file for Windows 95 OSR2:

  Esdi_506.pdr version 4.00.1116 (dated 8/25/97) and later

To install this update, follow these steps:

1. Download the Remideup.exe file from the online service listed below to an
  empty folder.

2. In My Computer or Windows Explorer, double-click the Remideup.exe file you
  downloaded in step 1.

3. Follow the instructions on the screen.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  Download Remideup.exe now

  Voltrack.vxd  4.00.954   3/6/96 9:54a    18,518  Windows\System\Iosubsys

is not installed on computers running OSR2.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Ultra DMA, also known as Ultra DMA/33, is an extension of the ATA hard disk
interface that allows burst data transfer rates of 33.3 MB per second (double
the ATA-2/ATA-3 standard of 16.6 MB per second).

This new standard is supported by controller chip sets such as the Intel PIIX4
chip set.
