SYMPTOMS
========

When SNA Server attempts to process two large print jobs (approximately 700
pages), the SNA 3270 Emulator logs an event 685, indicating that a failure to
extend a buffer pool occurred. The affected component is terminated and both
print jobs fail.

  ID 685 Event Details

  An attempt was made to extend a buffer pool, but the related pool had
  reached its maximum size. The affected component is terminating, and an
  audit of the buffer pools just before termination is attached

  EXPLANATION
  This error is almost always due to either an SNA component (including
  possibly an emulator) losing buffers or a slow emulator (or RUI
  application) using a session without pacing.

  ACTION
  Contact your support personnel.

CAUSE
=====

The print server will occasionally produce an extra credit message. Normally
this would not cause a problem. The print server would cope with the extra
message. However, in the case of a very large job, the print server never has
time to catch up with the extra messages. The input queue increases until the
buffer limit is reached (3,000 outstanding messages).

RESOLUTION
==========

Defer sending credit messages until the print server is capable of processing
the message immediately, so that the message is not put back on the input queue.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 1
(SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
