----------------------------------------------------------
1. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS FOR RUNNING MICROSOFT BOOKSHELF
----------------------------------------------------------
To install and run Microsoft(R) Bookshelf(R) 98 you need:

- Any Power Macintosh or 25MHz 68030 Macintosh computer that supports
 a 256-color, 640x480 (13-inch) or higher resolution monitor
- System 7.1 or later
- At least 8 MB of random-access memory (RAM) (12MB is recommended for
 System 7.5 and above)
- CD-ROM drive (double-speed or faster)

You can run Bookshelf 98 directly from the compact disc. However, to play
the movies and hear the sounds, QuickTime(TM) 2.0 or later must be
installed in your System Folder. If Bookshelf 98 can't find these files, it
will prompt you to run the Installer. You can also install QuickTime
manually by dragging the files from the System Files folder on the CD onto
your System Folder icon.

The Bookshelf 98 Installer will add all necessary files to your System
Folder. It will also copy the Bookshelf 98 program to a folder on your hard
disk titled "Bookshelf 98". Although installing the application on to your
hard drive occupies about 8 MB of hard drive space, it makes the program
launch and run noticeably faster. The text, sounds, and images remain on
the Bookshelf 98 disc, so you still need to insert the compact disk to run
Bookshelf.

---------------
2. MEMORY USE
---------------
Bookshelf 98 will run on any Macintosh with 8 MB of RAM. However, 4 MB of
memory must be free when you launch Bookshelf 98.

Most systems with 8 MB of RAM will not experience problems, but if your
system software uses more than 4 MB you may need to adjust memory usage for
Bookshelf 98 to run properly.  If you have System 7.5 or greater installed
on your computer, your system software may take up more than 6 MB of RAM.
For users running System 7.5 or greater, we recommend at least 12 MB of
RAM.

Some general suggestions for optimizing memory usage follow:

- Run only one application at a time. If other applications are running,
close them, and then relaunch Bookshelf.

- Reduce the amount of memory being used by your system software. To do
this, return to the Finder and select About This Macintosh... (or About
This Computer... if you're running System 7.5.5 or later) from the Apple
menu at the top left corner of the screen. The Largest Unused Block needs
to be greater than 4096K to run Bookshelf 98. If the only item listed in
the About This Macintosh dialog is System Software and the Largest Unused
Block is less than 4096K, reduce the amount of memory used by your system
software. Refer to your Macintosh documentation for details on how to do
this, but some general suggestions follow:

- Open the Memory Control Panel and check the Disk Cache setting. Set the
Disk Cache setting to the lowest amount possible.

- Fonts and sounds consume system memory. You can make more memory
available by removing those you aren't using.  However, make sure that you
leave the Arial, Symbol, Times New Roman, and Bookshelf Fonts as these are
required by Bookshelf 98.

- Third-party system extensions such as screen savers, fax software,
desktop pictures, menu-modifying utilities, and other system enhancements
increase the amount of memory consumed by your system software. They may
also cause a conflict with Bookshelf. Removing some or all of these
extensions will increase the amount of memory available to applications and
minimize the risk of conflict. Be sure that you save anything you remove
from your System Folder and place it in a separate folder on your hard disk
so that you can replace it later. You can use Apple's Extension Manager or
an equivalent third-party utility to do this. Please make sure not to
remove your CD-ROM driver software, or QuickTime as those extensions are
necessary to run Bookshelf 98.

- Turn on Virtual Memory. Virtual Memory allows you to increase the amount
of available memory by using space on your computer's hard disk to simulate
RAM. Although using virtual memory may slow down performance, the extra
available memory may cause applications like Bookshelf 98 to be allocated
more memory at start up or allow more applications to be run
simultaneously. To turn on Virtual Memory, open the Memory control panel,
switch the Virtual Memory radio button to on, and then restart your
computer.

Warning: Reducing the minimum size for Bookshelf's memory requirements may
cause the program to perform poorly. For example, Bookshelf 98 may not be
able to play video clips or enlarge images if it runs out of memory. If you
allocate less than 4096K, these problems are likely to result.

For support on Mac OS memory management, please contact Apple Computer,
Inc.

----------------
3. PERFORMANCE
----------------
If Bookshelf 98 seems to be running slowly or its audio and video clips are
choppy or interrupted, there are a number of things which may help:

- If you have over 8 MB of available hard drive space, you can install the
Bookshelf 98 application to your computer's hard drive rather than running
it directly off the CD-ROM. To install the application to your computer's
hard drive, double-click the Installer icon on the Bookshelf 98 disc and
select Easy Install.

- If less than 5 MB of memory are free when you start Bookshelf, you may
notice some performance problems. Check the previous section, MEMORY USE.

- Increase the preferred size for Bookshelf's memory allocation. Microsoft
Bookshelf 98 is preset to a suggested memory size of 5000K. If there is
sufficient additional memory available to run Bookshelf, you can increase
the amount of memory the program requests by selecting the Microsoft
Bookshelf 98 application icon on your hard drive, choosing Get Info from
the File menu, and then changing the preferred size in the area titled
"Memory Requirements".

Note: If the Bookshelf 98 application is running or busy, these fields may
be locked. If you encounter this problem, quit Bookshelf, and try again. If
this persists, restart your computer and try again.

- If you are using Virtual Memory to expand available memory to more than
double physical RAM capacity, you may find that Bookshelf 98 runs slowly.
For best performance, turn off Virtual Memory or reduce its allocated size
in the Memory control panel.

-  Bookshelf 98 is designed to work properly on a CD-ROM drive with a
150K/sec transfer rate or faster. A double-speed CD-ROM drive or one with a
faster transfer rate will provide even better performance in some areas. If
your CD-ROM drive has a sustained transfer rate of less than 150K/sec, it
may not be able to supply audio and video information to the Macintosh at
the speed required. This problem can only be fixed by upgrading to a faster
CD-ROM drive. If you suspect a problem with your drive, ensure that it is
properly terminated and that its software is properly installed. For
details on SCSI termination, see your Macintosh or CD-ROM drive
documentation, or contact your Apple dealer.

- A dirty or scratched compact disc can cause your drive to perform poorly.
Other symptoms are "Cannot Read" error messages and ceaseless spinning of
the CD-ROM (these appear to cause the computer to "hang"). Make sure the
bottom surface of the Bookshelf 98 disc is clean and undamaged.

- If you are using QuickTime 2.0, the video clips and animations in
Bookshelf 98 will run more smoothly if you upgrade to QuickTime 2.5. To
install QuickTime 2.5, double-click the Bookshelf 98 Installer icon on the
Bookshelf 98 disc, select Customize, and install the QuickTime package that
is appropriate for your Macintosh.

QuickTime Support and Upgrades are available on http://quicktime.apple.com.

-----------------------------------------
4. SCREEN SIZES AND COLOR CONFIGURATION
-----------------------------------------
On startup, Bookshelf 98 checks your monitor to ensure your computer is set
for at least 256 colors.  If your monitor is set to a lower configuration,
but the settings can be adjusted to run in 256 colors, you will be prompted
to change the settings.

Bookshelf 98 will run on any 256-color, 640x480 (13-inch) or higher
resolution Macintosh compatible monitor, although Bookshelf's video clips
and still images look best in 16-bit color (thousands of colors) or 24-bit
color (millions of colors).

Note: Running in 24-bit color (millions of colors) will slow performance
and cause Bookshelf 98 to consume memory more quickly. If your Macintosh
normally runs in this color mode and you get out of memory messages, you
can increase the amount of memory Bookshelf 98 requests by clicking the
Microsoft Bookshelf 98 icon, choosing Get Info from the File menu, and then
changing the preferred size in the area titled "Memory Requirements".

Bookshelf 98 is not designed to run in black and white, in 16 colors, or on
monitors displaying less than 640x480 pixels (e.g., Color Classics, most
PowerBooks and all 12 inch Apple monitors).

-------------------
5. SOUND PROBLEMS
-------------------
If the audio in Bookshelf 98 is missing or interrupted, check the
following:

- Sounds will be inaudible if the sound level is turned down. To set the
sound level, open the Sound control panel and experiment with the speaker
volume setting until you find a comfortable sound level. If you set the
sound level to maximum, you may get sound distortion, just as you might on
a stereo system. With external speakers, be sure they are connected
properly and turned on; you can usually adjust sound level with the
external speaker volume knob as well as with the Sound control panel.

- If Virtual Memory is enabled on your Macintosh, sounds may be choppy.
When Virtual Memory is turned on, sounds are sometimes temporarily stored
on the hard disk rather than in physical RAM. For optimal performance,
Virtual Memory should be turned off. To disable Virtual Memory, open the
Memory control panel, click the Virtual Memory Off button, and then restart
your computer.

Note: You must have a sufficient amount of RAM to run your both your System
Software and Bookshelf 98 (and any other applications) with Virtual Memory
turned off.  Also note that it may not be appropriate to turn off Virtual
Memory on a Power Macintosh.  Please see your manual for more information
about Power Macintoshes and Virtual Memory.

- In low memory situations, sounds may not load or play. If you cannot get
a sound to play and are sure that your Sound control panel is set
correctly, or you are receiving error messages when attempting to play
sounds, you may need to allocate more memory for Bookshelf. See the MEMORY
USE section for suggestions on how to solve memory problems.

- Some sounds used in Bookshelf 98 are stored on the disc in a compressed
format. In order to be played, the sound must be read from the disc and
decompressed. Older or slower Macintoshes (such as the Macintosh IIci and
Macintosh LC III) may experience interruptions in audio playback.

- In some situations, QuickTime 2.0 and Sound Manager 3.0 may have
insufficient system memory available to play sounds. Upgrading to QuickTime
2.5, included with Bookshelf 98, should improve the system's ability to
play sounds under these conditions.

- Version 1.5.1 of Connectix RAM Doubler(TM) has a known bug that prevents
audio and video clips from playing properly on Power Macintosh models. To
obtain upgrade information, contact Connectix Corporation. For RAM
Doubler(TM) support see http://www.connectix.com.

- There are some incompatibilities with Now Menus and Bookshelf 98 audio.
Adjusting the volume of the audio via the Now Menus customized menus should
be avoided while Bookshelf 98 is running. For Now Menus support see
http://www.nowsoft.com.

------------------------
6. PRINTING AND COPYING
------------------------
You can print or copy from any article within Bookshelf 98 by selecting a
range of text and choosing the appropriate command from the File or Edit
menu. To copy a media element, select it by holding down the Control key
and then click on the image. In the shortcut menu that appears, choose
Copy. Please note that sounds cannot be copied due to copyright
restrictions.

If you find that printed text is improperly formatted or that special
characters do not print correctly, try the following:

- Turn off Background Printing. Bookshelf 98 stores its custom TrueType
fonts within the application. This provides Bookshelf 98 access to these
custom fonts without taking up space on your hard drive. However, because
many printer drivers launch a separate application to manage the printer
queue and handle print jobs in the background, printing errors may result
when Background Printing is enabled. To disable Background Printing, open
the Chooser, select the active printer and switch the Background Printing
radio button to off.

Note: If you install the Bookshelf 98 TrueType fonts, Background Printing
is fully supported. To install these fonts, start the Installer on the
Bookshelf 98 disc, choose Customize from the popup menu, select Bookshelf
98 Fonts, and press Return.

------------
7. SCRIPTING
------------
You can use Microsoft Bookshelf to look up and define words from
AppleScript, QuicKeys, Userland Frontier or any OSA-compliant scripting
environment. The Microsoft Bookshelf custom AppleEvent suite is defined
as follows:

--------------------
8. TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------------
If you find that you are experiencing trouble, first check the following:

- Wrong or Multiple Versions of QuickTime(TM)
During installation, the Installer checks the versions of QuickTime and
Sound Manager present on your Macintosh and, if necessary, replaces them
with newer versions. However, the Installer cannot remove older versions if
you or another installer program have renamed them. For example, if you
renamed an older version of QuickTime to "Old QuickTime", the Bookshelf 98
Installer would install a newer version of QuickTime, but would fail to
remove the older version. The same would happen if another installer
application placed a file, "QuickTime 2.0" in the Extensions folder. The
only QuickTime files should be named, QuickTime(TM), QuickTime(TM)
PowerPlug (Power Mac only), QuickTime(TM) Musical Instruments and
QuickTime(TM) Settings. To fix this problem, manually remove any renamed
copies of these system components and restart your Macintosh.

- Font Display Problems
Microsoft Bookshelf 98 uses custom fonts to represent special and
international characters. These characters usually don't correspond to
special characters within the standard Macintosh character set and will
appear as inappropriate or non-printing characters when copied to an
application such as SimpleText. However, these special and international
characters will print correctly if you print from Bookshelf 98 or install
the Bookshelf 98 Fonts and paste into an applications that support Rich
Text Format (RTF) such as Microsoft Office and Microsoft Works.

- Problems Running Bookshelf on System 7.0
Due to an incompatibility among Microsoft Bookshelf, Apple Guide 2.0, and
versions of System 7.0, access to the Bookshelf Guide from within the
Bookshelf 98 application has been disabled with this configuration and the
minimum configuration for Bookshelf 98 is 7.1. To fix this problem, upgrade
to System 7.1 or later.

- Problems installing Bookshelf or changing Bookshelf's memory partition
In order to minimize the number of extensions that Microsoft Bookshelf 98
must install in your System Folder, we have built several PowerPC shared
libraries into the Microsoft Bookshelf 98 application itself. Since these
libraries can stay open even after you quit the application, you may be
unable to delete the Microsoft Bookshelf 98 application or edit the
application's memory partition sizes in Get Info until you restart your
Macintosh.

- Unsuccessful searches in Quick Zip Code
In some instances the Quick Zip Code may be unable to suggest a zip code
based on a street address alone. In this case, try using a specific city
name (spelled correctly) and/or a state name to narrow down zip code
information.

- Internet Connection Difficulties
Depending on your Internet connection, it may take up to several minutes
for your browser to successfully connect with a site that you have launched
from the Internet Directory. You should wait to see if the connection is
successful before returning to the Internet Directory and attempting to
initiate another link. Attempting to connect with multiple Internet sites
simultaneously is not recommended.

--------------------------------------------------------------
9.  SPECIAL INFORMATION ABOUT BOOKSHELF 98 AND THE INTERNET
--------------------------------------------------------------

For the online features in Bookshelf 98 to work, you will need access to
the Internet through an Internet Service Provider (ISP).  These online
features include URLs in the Internet Directory and in the Help Menu.

You may already have an ISP through your employer or academic institution.
However, if you want to use the Internet for personal use, you may need to
find an ISP that sells Internet access to the general public. If you use an
ISP with proprietary software, be sure to ask if they have a Macintosh
version - some are Windows-only - and find out if the Macintosh version has
similar features to the Windows version.

Most Macintosh users access the Internet with their modem through a SLIP or
PPP account using a freeware control panel (although there are commercial
versions and Apple has recently released its own PPP control panel designed
for use with Open Transport 1.1.2). Whether you will use SLIP or PPP
depends on what software you have and which protocol your ISP supports, but
PPP is the more flexible protocol and has lately become much more
prevalent. These accounts let you run graphical Internet applications that
work and feel just like Macintosh applications should. If your computer has
enough memory, you can even run several Internet programs concurrently with
Bookshelf.

Setting up a SLIP/PPP control panel and configuring the MacTCP or the
TCP/IP control panel (included with Open Transport in System 7.5.2 and
later) can be a bit overwhelming. Your ISP should walk you through this
process, providing you with critical information like DNS addresses and
search domains, as well as the essential phone numbers and modem settings
to get you up and running on their service.

When Bookshelf 98 launches an Internet application, the browser assumes
that you have a TCP/IP connection already established. Some SLIP/PPP
control panels will automatically dial up and initiate a session when you
launch an Internet application, but often the time lag required for dialing
and negotiating the connection exceeds the timeout on the request. So you
should usually connect to your ISP prior to using the Internet Directory or
other features that connect you to the Internet.

Depending on the speed of your Internet connection, it may take up to
several minutes for your Web browser to successfully connect with a site
that you have launched from Bookshelf 98. You should wait to see if the
connection is successful before returning to Bookshelf and attempting to
initiate another link. Attempting to connect with multiple Internet sites
simultaneously is not recommended.

Bookshelf 98 uses software called Internet Config to determine which Web
browser should be used to connect to the Web. If you aren't currently using
Internet Config, it will be installed for you when you run the Bookshelf 98
Installer.  Also your Internet Preferences will be preset to use Internet
Explorer to handle the following Internet resource types: Web (http), FTP
(ftp), Gopher (gopher), Email (mailto) and Usenet News Groups (news). If
you want to use a different browser or override any of these defaults, you
can start the Internet Config application and change the Helper application
for that resource type.

Note: For more information on Internet Config, please see the User
Documentation provided in the Internet Config 1.3 folder.

HOW TO CHOOSE YOUR BROWSER WITH INTERNET CONFIG:

If Internet Config is not set up properly, you may see the following
error message:

  Internet Config is not properly installed. Please launch Internet
  Config and ensure that you have a valid helper application selected
  for this Internet resource type.

Or you may simply click on an Internet Link in Bookshelf 98 and have
nothing happen.  If this is the case you need to use Internet Config to
select your HTTP Helper application. To select the helper application,
do the following:

1. Locate and open the Internet Config 1.3 folder on your hard drive.

2. Double-click the Internet Config application icon.

3. In the Window menu, choose the Helpers item.

4. Select the HTTP icon, and then click Change.

5. Click Choose Helper.

6. Navigate to the location of web browser.

7. Select the application, and then click Open.

8. Click OK.

9. On the File menu, click Quit, and then click OK when prompted to
  save the changes.
