SUMMARY
=======

During the setup of Microsoft Visual J++ Publisher's Edition from the Microsoft
Press "Learn Java Now" companion CD-ROM, the Setup program asks the following:

  Please type your name and organization, and your 10 digit 'CD Key' located on
  the yellow sticker of your CD liner notes or CD sleeve.

The input boxes for your name and organization are available, but the input box
for the CD key is grayed out and includes a number of X's.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is not an error. The full version of Microsoft Visual J++ is packaged on a
CD-ROM with a jewel case. This jewel case includes a sticker listing a CD key,
used for registration purposes. The Publisher's version of Microsoft Visual J++
does not include this sticker.

To continue through the setup, simply enter your name and company (if applicable)
into the appropriate boxes, and then click Next.

Microsoft Press has received reports that the CD key field is blank--neither
grayed out nor with the X's as described above. If the CD key field is not
filled in when you click the Next button, the setup program will respond with an
error message instructing you to enter the CD key into the appropriate field.

Microsoft Press has not been able to reproduce this error. If you cannot continue
in the setup program by entering your name (and company, if applicable) and
clicking Next, then please send details of your problem to
MSPINPUT@MICROSOFT.COM. Include the following information:

- The operating system that you are running (e.g. Windows 95).

- Any other programs you have running while you are running the Setup program.

- Whether you have other programs that use the Microsoft Developer Environment
  (e.g. Microsoft Visual C++).

- Any other information you feel is relevant.

Microsoft Press will continue to investigate this issue and will post further
information in this article when available.
