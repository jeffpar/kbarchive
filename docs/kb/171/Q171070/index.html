The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
- Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Systems Management Server 1.2 now provides the ability to install
packages on computers running Windows NT Workstation in the background by means
of the Package Command Manager (PCM) service. This functionality was included
with Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 2, and also as a separate update
available on the Web (Pcmupdte.exe) at

  http://www.microsoft.com/smsmgmt/.

A requirement for using Package Command Manager as a service is that the
executable file it starts must be run "silently" with no user input. Microsoft
Systems Management Server Installer can create executable files that allow for
silent running through the "/s" command line switch. In addition, the RESTART
script variable, when set to "S" in the Installer script, causes a restart of
the system. Lastly, using these two options in conjunction with selecting the
advanced Installation Properties check box for Suppress Reboot Message During
Silent Installations provides a completely unattended installation of an
Installer package and restarts the computer at the end of the installation. See
the Installer online documentation for details on this functionality.

While the Installer provides this method for installing a package silently and
restarting, it fails to restart if:

- A run command is sent through the PCM service and no user is logged on or the
  workstation is locked. In this case, the Installer package will run
  correctly, but upon completion, the system restart will not occur. However,
  the job is marked as completed.

- A shell other than Explorer (if you are running Windows NT 4.0) or Program
  Manager (if you are running Windows NT 3.5x) is managing the desktop.

An active shell, such as Explorer or Program Manager, is required for Systems
Management Server Installer's own restart mechanism to work properly. The shell
is not available if the user is logged off or has the workstation locked.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If an application installation requires a restart and must be installed when a
user is not logged on, you must use some method other than the Installer to
restart the workstation. One possible solution is to use the Ntencap.exe
utility. The latest version of this utility (provided with the Package Command
Manager Web update or Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 2) has a
command line switch that blocks a restart (if it is issued by the executable it
encapsulates), begins a timer countdown, then initiates its own shutdown
process.

Ntencap.exe is located in the Mstest subdirectory of the SMS_SHR of all logon
servers.

The Package Command Manager service runs Ntencap.exe as part of a Run Command On
Workstation job. To use the Ntencap.exe restart functionality with an executable
file created by the Installer, use the following syntax in the package
properties, workstation command line:

     NTENCAP.EXE /NTz:xx myprog.exe /s

Where "xx" is the time in seconds to wait before restarting the computer and
"myprog.exe" is the Installer executable file.

After the Run Command On Workstation job completes, the following message will be
displayed on the workstation, regardless of whether a user is logged on:

  System Shutdown

  The system is shutting down. Please save all work in progress and log off. Any
  unsaved changes will be lost. This shutdown was initiated by DOMAIN\pcmsvc.

  Time before shutdown: xx:xx:xx.

After the timer expires, the system will shut down and restart.

IMPORTANT: Any unsaved work on the workstation will be lost when it restarts. Be
sure to use the /NTz:xx option to provide an adequate amount of time for users
to save their work. A value of 300 would provide users with five minutes to save
all their work.

This solution should not be implemented in situations where users may leave their
workstations unattended (that is, not logged off) with unsaved work.

Other Alternatives
------------------

Alternative methods in this situation would be:

- Send a separate mandatory job (not system-background) that restarts the
  workstation after the package installation. A utility created by the
  Installer can include an interactive dialog box informing the user that an
  application was recently installed and requires the system to be restarted.
  Also, if the Installer executable file restarts the workstation, it will
  allow each application open to prompt the user to save any unsaved work.

- Use the Shutdown.exe utility from the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit, sent as a
  separate mandatory system-background job. Shutdown.exe provides restart
  functionality similar to Ntencap.exe, but with additional options. Unless you
  use the "/c" switch, it allows the application's prompt to save data that may
  have changed, protecting the user who has stepped away from his or her desk
  from loss of data. You can also include an additional message, up to 127
  characters in length, which gives an explanation for the required restart.
  For information on Shutdown.exe syntax and usage, see the Windows NT Resource
  Kit Tools Help file.

- Ask the users to restart their computers manually (for example, send an
  e-mail mail message to the users, asking them to manually restart their
  computers).
