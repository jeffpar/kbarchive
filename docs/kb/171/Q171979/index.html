SYMPTOMS
========

If a property of an object is referred to in its own Initialize event, then
Visual Basic will fire the Initialize event for that object so that it can be
instantiated. An infinite recursion will result until stack space runs out and
you receive the following error:

  Run-time error '28':
  Out of stack space

This will occur for "built-in" objects, such as Forms, and objects created using
Visual Basic classes.

CAUSE
=====

Before a property of an object can be accessed, the object must be initialized.
This is, in fact, the whole point of the Initialize event; it allows the
developer to place the object in a satisfactory state by initializing private
data before the properties and methods of an object are invoked. The properties
and methods may have to rely on the internal data of the object being in a
stable state.

Consequently, the Initialize event must be completed before a property or method
of an object can be accessed, and therefore it is not unexpected that the
Initialize event is fired again when a property is referred to in the Initialize
event.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you are trying to set a property of a Visual Basic built-in object, then it
may be possible to refer to the property in an event that occurs later than the
Initialize event. For example, rather than setting the Caption of a Form in the
Initialize event, set it in the Load event or the Activate event.

An alternative to referring directly to Form1, which is a global object pointer,
is to use the Me keyword. When referring directly to Form1 in the Initialize
event of the Form, the global object Form1 has not been created so Visual Basic
tries to instantiate it. This process causes the infinite recursion. Use the Me
Keyword to avoid this recursion.

If you are trying to set a property for an object created with class modules in
Visual Basic, it may be appropriate to create a Method for initializing data or
setting initial values for properties, for which the client program would be
responsible for calling after instantiating an object. (Perhaps a good analogous
example of this is the OLE API function OLEInitialize, which client programs
written in C must explicitly call before using OLE services).

Another way to accomplish this is to set the private data on which a property
relies in the Initialize event. For example, if a Visual Basic property of a
class uses a private data member like so:

     Private lPrivProp1 As Long

     Public Property Get lProp1() As Long
     lProp1 = lPrivProp1
     End Property

     Public Property Let lProp1(vNewValue As Long)
     lPrivProp1 = vNewValue
     End Property

then in the Initialize event of the class module in which this property is
contained, it is not appropriate to try and set the public property of the
class, but rather to set the private data member to a value.

STATUS
======

This is by design.

NOTE: The behavior with Visual Basic versions 5.0 and 6.0 has changed. You no
longer receive the run-time error when accessing the property of an object in
the Initialize event of a form. However, it is still recommended that you
continue to use the Load or Activate events of a Form to access properties of
objects instead of the Initialize event.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps To Reproduce the Problem
------------------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. In the Initialize event of Form1, add the following line of code:

        Form1.Caption = "Hello world"

3. Run the project by pressing the F5 key. Eventually Visual Basic will run out
  of stack space.

Steps to Work Around the Problem
--------------------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. In the Initialize event, place the following line of code:

        Me.Caption = "Hello world"

3. Run the project by pressing the F5 key. The Form should appear with a "Hello
  World" caption.
