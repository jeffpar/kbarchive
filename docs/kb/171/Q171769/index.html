SYMPTOMS
========

After you run the repair process in Windows NT and select the options below on
the restore registry screen, all default settings are restored. No user accounts
exist, and the administrator password is returned to the password in use at the
time the Emergency Repair Disk (ERD) was made or updated.

[X] SYSTEM (System Configuration)
[X] SOFTWARE (Software Information)
[X] DEFAULT (Default User Profile)
[X] SECURITY (Security Policy) and SAM (User Accounts Database)

CAUSE
=====

Choosing to overwrite the registry and replace all SAM and security information
creates this situation.

RESOLUTION
==========

The recommended method to restore the proper user account database and domain
password is to restore the registry from a current tape backup. If a current
tape backup is not available, or, restoring from tape will cause other problems,
the following method can be used to restore users. If using this method causes
other problems, restore the registry from backup or recreate the user accounts.

This resolution assumes that you have the administrator password needed to sign
on to the local computer and that the user is local, or their profile is stored
locally (or the user is on the domain but their profile is stored locally).

NOTE: This is not a feasible solution for restoring more than a few users. This
resolution does not insure that applications will function correctly. Some
applications replace Windows NT files and can not work with the Windows NT files
that are restored from the selected options through the ERD process.
Applications may need to be reinstalled.

If the User Logs On to the Computer Locally
-------------------------------------------

1. Log on to the local computer with administrator privileges.

2. Recreate the user of the workstation in User Manager.

3. Go to the %SystemRoot%\Profiles\ directory and rename the Default User
  profile to Default Old.

4. Rename the user profile of the user you are trying to restore, Default User.

5. Log on to the local computer as that user and the Default profile will be
  assigned to them.

6. Log off the computer as the user, log on to the computer as administrator,
  and delete the Default User profile.

7. Repeat steps 1-6 to restore user's profiles.

8. Rename Default Old to Default User.

If the User Logs On to the Domain but the Profile is Stored Locally
-------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Delete the machine account from the domain.

2. Log on to the local computer with administrator privileges and rejoin the
  domain.

3. Perform steps 3-8 above.

If the User has Successfully Logged On to the
Computer at Least Once and Created a New Profile
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Log on to the local computer with administrator privileges.

2. Go to the %SystemRoot%\Profiles directory, and delete the user.000 profile.

3. Perform steps 3-8 above.
