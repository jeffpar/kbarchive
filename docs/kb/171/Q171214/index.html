The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you receive a reply from a Lotus cc:Mail user through a cc:Mail post office
(PO2) located behind a cc:Mail router, you may receive a non- delivery report
(NDR) if you attempt to reply to the message. However, you are able to
successfully send and receive new messages through PO2. You are also able to
successfully reply to new messages sent by users on PO2, and users on PO2 are
able to successfully reply to new messages sent by you.

Note that this problem does not occur if the original reply from the cc:Mail user
is sent through a cc:Mail post office (PO1) that is not located behind a cc:Mail
router.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

- On the Exchange Server computer, add a new cc:Mail address in the properties
  for the custom recipient associated with the cc:Mail user who sent the
  original reply. To do so, follow these steps:

  1. In the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program, click the custom
     recipient (the cc:Mail user who sent the original reply), and then on the
     File menu, click Properties.

  2. Click the E-mail Addresses tab.

  3. Click New, click cc:Mail Address, and then click OK.

  4. Type the information for the recipient's mailbox on the cc:Mail post
     office (PO1) which is connected directly to the original Exchange Server
     computer, click OK, and then click OK again.

  5. Attempt to reply to the message again.

- Send the reply through a different Exchange Server computer which is
  connected directly to the original cc:Mail post office (PO2). In this case,
  the two computers are not connected through a cc:Mail router. To do so,
  follow these steps:

  1. Create an Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail on the Exchange Server
     computer which is connected directly to PO2.

  2. In the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program on the Exchange Server
     computer which is connected directly to PO1, click the custom recipient
     (the cc:Mail user who sent the original reply), and then on the File menu,
     click Properties.

  3. Click the E-mail Addresses tab.

  4. Click New, click cc:Mail Address, and then click OK.

  5. Type the information for the recipient's mailbox on PO1, and then click
     OK.

  6. Click the new address, click Set As Reply Address, and then click OK.

  7. Attempt to reply to the message again.

A similar problem is the failure of replies to SMTP messages that are received
from the Internet connector to the cc:Mail PO. For additional information about
this problem, please see the following article in the Knowledge Base:
