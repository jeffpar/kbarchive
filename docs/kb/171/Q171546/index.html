SYMPTOMS
========

When using Visual Basic 4.0 with an Unbound DBGrid and the Visual Basic 5.0
DBGrid32.ocx, data does not get cached correctly. This results in invalid rows
being displayed in the grid.

For example, an application using the Visual Basic 4.0 version would correctly
display three rows of data. The same application would display only one row of
data once the Visual Basic 5.0 version of the DBGrid control is installed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by a bug in the Visual Basic 5.0 Data Bound Grid Controls
(DBGrid32.ocx) in the version that ships with the product (5.00.3714) and in the
version that ships with Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 1 (5.00.3817). Visual
Studio 97 Service Pack 2 did not include an updated version of the control.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service
Pack 3.

For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q170365 : INFO: Visual Studio 97 Service Packs - What, Where, and Why

For a list of the Visual Basic 5.0 bugs that were fixed in the Visual Studio 97
Service Pack 3, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q175450 : INFO: Visual Basic 5.0 Fixes in Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 3

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem does not occur if the application that uses the DBGrid control has
been built with Visual Basic 5.0.

This problem also does not occur if the application built by Visual Basic 4.0 is
a 16-bit application. That application would use the 16-bit DBGrid control and
would be unaffected by this problem in the 32-bit version of the control.
