-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You have configured your Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) server to start
replication at a specific time with a specific replication interval. However,
you notice that replication does not occur at the specified time. Additionally,
you may notice that WINS reacts differently depending on the version of Windows
NT.

CAUSE
=====

The start time for replication is ignored if the specified time has passed when
the WINS server is started.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.


Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. A
supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.


MORE INFORMATION
================

If you set the replication start time to 1:00 AM and the replication interval to
24 hours, and then start WINS (or restart the computer) at any time after 1:00
AM and before 12:00 AM (for example, at 10:00AM), the replication will start the
next day at 10:00 AM. The replication will start as specified if WINS is started
between 12:00 AM and 1:00 AM.
