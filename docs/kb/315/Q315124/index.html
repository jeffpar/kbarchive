The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 6.0, 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The FoxSock.exe sample is adapted from the first Microsoft Visual Basic sample
presented in the article "Using the Winsock Control", which is available at the
following MSDN Web site:

  http://msdn.Microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vbcon98/html/vbconusingwinsockcontrol.asp

The Microsoft Winsock Control ships with Visual FoxPro (VFP) 6.0 and 7.0. It is
not supported in VFP 5.0. This sample has been tested on Microsoft Windows 98,
Microsoft Windows 2000, and Microsoft Windows XP.

The FoxSock.exe file contains the following files:

+--------------------+
| File name   | Size | 
+--------------------+
| Summary.txt | 2K   | 
+--------------------+
| Winsock.pjx | 2K   | 
+--------------------+
| Winsock.pjt | 4K   | 
+--------------------+
| Winsock.prg | 1K   | 
+--------------------+
| Server.scx  | 3K   | 
+--------------------+
| Server.sct  | 7K   | 
+--------------------+
| Client.scx  | 3K   | 
+--------------------+
| Client.sct  | 7K   | 
+--------------------+

To use this sample, follow these steps:

1. Unzip FoxSock.exe to your computer, and then set the default directory in
  Visual FoxPro to the directory to which you extracted the files.

2. Run Winsock.prg to launch the server and client forms.

3. Click Connect on the client form, and type some text in the Send text box in
  either form. When you leave the Send box, your text will appear in the other
  form's Receive box.

Differences from the Visual Basic sample include the following:

- You need to use the ".Object" syntax when you call the Winsock control's
  methods (for instance, oleWinsock.Object.Connect) instead of referring to the
  control directly from the OleControl.

- The control setup code is placed in the Init method instead of the Load
  method. The Visual Basic example does not close the connection. If you close
  the forms in VFP without closing the connection first, VFP appears to stop
  responding (hang) for a while.

- Additional settings (Close buttons, tab order) were made for clarity.
