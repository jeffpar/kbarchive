SUMMARY
=======

This article demonstrates how to detect if a screen saver is running by using
Visual Basic 6.0. In this sample, you use the SystemParametersInfo function and
specify the SPI_GETSCREENSAVERRUNNING parameter.

Requirements
------------

The following list outlines the recommended hardware, software, network
infrastructure, and service packs that you need:

- Microsoft Windows XP, Microsoft Window Millennium Edition (Me), Microsoft
  Windows 2000, or Microsoft Windows 98 (see the References section for
  articles that relate to earlier versions of Windows)

In addition, this article assumes that you have Visual Basic 6.0 programming
experience.

Create an Application That Determines Screen Saver State
--------------------------------------------------------

1. Start Visual Basic 6.0, and then create a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is
  created by default.

2. Add a Timer control to Form1, and then set the Interval property of the Timer
  to "1000" (without the quotation marks). This interval represents one second.

3. Right-click the form, and then click View Code. Add the following code to the
  General Declarations section of Form1's module:

  Option Explicit

  Private Declare Function SystemParametersInfo _
      Lib "user32" _
      Alias "SystemParametersInfoA" _
        (ByVal uiAction As Long, _
         ByVal uiParam As Long, _
         pvParam As Any, _
         ByVal fWInIni As Long) As Boolean

  Private Const SPI_GETSCREENSAVEACTIVE As Long = &amp;H10
  Private Const SPI_GETSCREENSAVERRUNNING As Long = &amp;H72

4. Define a form-load handler procedure for your form. Add the following code,
  which displays a caption to indicate whether the screen saver is active:

  Private Sub Form_Load()
      Dim bActive As Boolean
      
      ' Find out if screen saver is active, and display a suitable message.
      SystemParametersInfo SPI_GETSCREENSAVEACTIVE, 0, bActive, False
      If bActive Then
          Me.Caption = "Screen saver is active"
      Else
          Me.Caption = "Screen saver is not active"
      End If
  End Sub

5. Define a timer-event handler procedure for the timer. This event occurs once
  every second. Add the following code to this procedure, which produces a
  sound if the screen saver is running:

  Private Sub Timer1_Timer()
      Dim bRunning As Boolean

      ' Beep if the screen saver is running.
      SystemParametersInfo SPI_GETSCREENSAVERRUNNING, 0, bRunning, False
      If bRunning Then
          Beep
      End If
  End Sub

Verify That It Works
--------------------

1. If a screen saver is not enabled on the computer, follow these steps to
  enable a screen saver:

  a. Right-click in the desktop, and then click Properties.

  b. In the Display Properties dialog box, on the Screen Saver tab, select a
     screen saver. Wait for approximately one minute, and then click OK.

2. Build and run your Visual Basic application. The form caption in your
  application displays the following message:

  Screen saver is active

  NOTE: If the caption displays the "Screen saver is not active" message, the
  screen saver is not enabled.

3. Wait for the screen saver to begin running. You hear short beeps at
  one-second intervals until the screen saver stops.

4. Close your Visual Basic application.

5. Reset the screen saver to your settings as appropriate.

Troubleshooting
---------------

- This application only calls SystemParametersInfo with the
  SPI_GETSCREENSAVEACTIVE parameter when the application starts to run. If the
  user changes the screen saver settings after this time, this information is
  not updated in the Visual Basic application.

- Earlier versions of Windows, such as Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 and Microsoft
  Windows 95, do not support the SPI_GETSCREENSAVERRUNNING parameter to
  SystemParametersInfo. If you want to determine if a screen saver is running
  on these earlier versions of Windows, refer to the References section.
