An array in a compiled BASIC program can be passed to an assembly
language program in the two ways shown below. The array can be passed
either through the CALL statement's parameter list or, for static
arrays only, through a COMMON block.

Microsoft does not support passing dynamic arrays through COMMON to
assembler (since this depends upon a Microsoft proprietary dynamic
array descriptor format that changes from version to version). Dynamic
arrays can be passed to assembler only as parameters in the CALL
statement.

This information applies to the following products:

1. Microsoft QuickBASIC Compiler versions 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50

2. Microsoft BASIC Compiler versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS and
   MS OS/2

3. Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) versions 7.00
   and 7.10 for MS-DOS and MS OS/2

For more information about passing other types of parameters between
BASIC and MASM, search in the Software/Data Library for the following
word:

   BAS2MASM

The following information pertains to passing an array to an assembly
routine through the CALL parameter list:

If the array is passed through the parameter list, all the information
about the array must be passed. This includes the length of each item,
the number of items, and the segment and offset of the base element of
the array. The first two items may be hardcoded into the assembler
program, but the latter two must be passed because there is no way of
knowing where the array will be located before the program starts. The
following is an example:

   DECLARE SUB PutInfo (BYVAL Segment%, BYVAL Offset%)
   DIM a%(100)
   CALL PutInfo(VARSEG(a%(0)),VARPTR(a%(0)))

The assembly-language program pulls the information off the stack,
then continues with its purpose. Please note that this method works
with both static and dynamic arrays.

The following information pertains to passing an array to an assembly
language routine through a COMMON block:

Passing information through a COMMON block to an assembly language
program is fairly simple. In the assembly language program, a segment
is set up with the same name as the COMMON block and then grouped with
DGROUP, as follows:

   BNAME segment 'BC_VARS'
     x  dw 1 dup (?)
     y  dw 1 dup (?)
     z  dw 1 dup (?)
   BNAME ends

  dgroup group BNAME

The above assembler code matches the following BASIC code named COMMON
block:

   DEFINT A-Z
   COMMON /BNAME/ x,y,z

Passing arrays through the COMMON block is done in a similar fashion.
However, only static arrays may be passed to assembler through COMMON.

Note: This information does not apply to passing far
variable-length-strings in BASIC PDS version 7.00 or 7.10. For
information on accessing far variable-length-strings in BASIC PDS
version 7.00 or 7.10, see Chapter 13, "Mixed-Language Programming with
Far Strings," in the "Microsoft BASIC 7.0: Programmer's Guide" for
versions 7.00 and 7.10.

When static arrays are used, the entire array is stored in the COMMON
block. Consider the following example:

BASIC Program
-------------

      DECLARE SUB PutInfo ()
      DIM b%(100)
      COMMON /BNAME/ a%, b%(), c%
      CALL PutInfo
      CLS
      PRINT a%, c%
      FOR i = 0 TO 100
       PRINT b%(i);
      NEXT i
      END

Assembly Program
-----------------

      ;Note, this program uses MASM version 5.x directives.

      .model Medium

       BNAME segment COMMON 'BC_VARS'
         a  dw 1 dup (?)
         b  db 202 dup (?)      ;Note that all the space for the
                                ;array is set up
         c  dw 1 dup (?)
       BNAME ends

       dgroup group BNAME

       .code

            public PutInfo
       PutInfo      proc   far
            push   bp
            mov    bp,sp
            push   di

            inc    word ptr dgroup:a
            inc    word ptr dgroup:c

            mov    cx,101
            mov    di,offset dgroup:b

       repeat:
            mov    [di],cx
            add    di,2
            loop   repeat

            pop    di
            pop    bp
            ret
       PutInfo      endp
            end

As noted in the assembly source, the space for the array must be set up
in the COMMON segment.

When dynamic arrays are used, the array is not placed in the COMMON
block. Instead, a multibyte array descriptor is placed on the COMMON
block. The dynamic array descriptor changes from version to version,
and is not released by Microsoft -- it is considered Microsoft
proprietary information.
