Cell Height
-----------

This is the height selected on positive lfHeight in the LOGFONT. It is the height
of the font bitmap for raster fonts. It is returned as tmHeight in the
TEXTMETRIC structure from GetTextMetrics().

Character Height (Also Known as Em)
-----------------------------------

This is the height selected on negative lfHeight in the LOGFONT. (That is, the
mapper will try to match a font whose character height matches the absolute
value of the requested height.)

NOTE: By definition, the Em is equal to Cell Height minus Internal Leading. The
Em defines the point size of a font. In MM_TEXT mapping mode, the Em is related
to the point size as follows:

     Em=dpiY*point_size/72;  // where dpiY is dots per inch in Y direction

The dpiY of a font is equal to tmDigitizedAspectY in the TEXTMETRICS structure.

Internal Leading
----------------

This is returned as tmInternalLeading in the TEXTMETRIC structure from
GetTextMetrics() and often, but not necessarily, describes how much space has
been left inside the font bitmap for diacritical marks (accents).

External Leading
----------------

This is returned as tmExternalLeading in the TEXTMETRIC structure from
GetTextMetrics() and describes how much extra space the font designer expects
the application to leave between rows of the font. It is not included in the
bitmap and is not modified by TextOut()/ExtTextOut(), even in OPAQUE mode. When
outputting multiple lines of text, the lines should be separated by (tmHeight +
tmExternalLeading).

Overhang
--------

tmOverhang specifies the per string extra width that may be added to some
synthesized fonts. When synthesizing some attributes such as bold or italic, GDI
or a device may have to add width to a string on both a per character and per
string basis. For example, GDI synthesizes embolding by expanding the
intercharacter spacing and overstriking with an offset and italicizes a font by
skewing the string.

In either case, there is an overhang past the basic string. For bold strings, it
is the distance by which the overstrike is offset. For italic strings, it is the
amount the top of the font is skewed past the bottom of the font. tmOverhang
allows the application to determine how much of the character width returned by
a GetTextExtent() call on a single character is the actual character width and
how much is the per string extra width. The actual width is the extent less the
overhang. In other words, tmOverhang is the difference between the width of a
character when it is output singly versus its width when it is in the interior
of a string.
