When compiling a program under a Novell network, the following
problems can occur:

1. A command-line error message.
2. A stack overflow.
3. The compiler hangs.
4. Programs created with C Version 4.00 and Link Version 3.51
   could generate Error 2003 : integer divide by zero.

This is not a problem with the Microsoft C Compiler, nor is it an
error on your part. A problem exists in the way Novell networking
software handles the EXEC function, one of the DOS interrupt 21h
functions used by the CL and MSC programs to start each of the
compiler passes.

Contact your Novell dealer about this problem; there should be a patch
available. Novell has stated this problem has been corrected in
Version 2.10 and later.

Novell's network emulates DOS; the problem arises from incorrect
emulation of the DOS int 21H function 4BH (EXEC program) call. The
Novell network assumes the calling program will save SS:SP before the
call. This was necessary on DOS Versions 2.x, but it is not necessary
to save the registers on DOS Versions 3.x.

The C compiler checks to see what version of DOS it is running on; if
you are running DOS Versions 2.x, save SS:SP; if you are running DOS
Versions 3.x (which is what Novell presents itself as) do not save
SS:SP. The network destroys those registers on the call even though
this behavior is unlike DOS Versions 3.x.
