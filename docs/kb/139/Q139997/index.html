The information in this article applies to:

- The AppWizard 
- The ClassWizard 

as they apply to:

- Microsoft Visual C++, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to modify a record in an MFC DAO application that uses a recordset
based on a join and that was created by AppWizard or ClassWizard, the
application may throw an exception on the update. Specifically, the exception
indicates:

  Item not found in this collection.

CAUSE
=====

When the wizards generate references to columns that have names that appear in
multiple tables of the join, the wizards will precede the column name with the
name of the table as a qualifier. Both the table name qualifier and column name
are enclosed in brackets in the DFX functions of the CDaoRecordset-derived
class's DoFieldExchange. For example:

     [Table].[Column]

The presence of the brackets combined with the use of the table name qualifier
causes the search for the specified field in the collection of fields maintained
by the database engine to fail.

NOTE: The presence of brackets around unqualified column names does not interfere
with the field name search and is thus acceptable. This explains why some fields
will be updatable while attempts to update others throws the exception; the
updatable fields are likely unique and therefore unqualified.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following two techniques depending
on the names of the affected tables and columns (the ones for which table
qualifiers are necessary).

If Table and Column Names Contain No Spaces
-------------------------------------------

Remove the brackets that enclose the table and column names. The resulting
reference should be of this form:

     Table.Column

If Table and/or Column Names Contain Spaces
-------------------------------------------

Don't remove the bracket delimiters or your application will throw an exception
that indicates:

  Syntax error in query expression 'table name.column name'.

Instead, you must override one of the existing overloads of the virtual function
CDaoRecordset::SetFieldValue() as follows (assuming your CDaoRecordset is named
CMyDaoRecordset):

     void CMyDaoRecordset::SetFieldValue(LPCTSTR lpszName,
                                    const COleVariant&amp; varValue)
     {
          CString strNewName(lpszName);
          StripBrackets(strNewName, strNewName.GetBuffer(0));
          strNewName.ReleaseBuffer();
          CDaoRecordset::SetFieldValue(strNewName, varValue);
     }

This override uses the StripBrackets member function of CDaoRecordset to remove
the offending brackets and allows the search for the field in the field
collection to succeed.

NOTE: You can easily add this override to your application by using the Visual
C++ ClassView Add Member Function command. Please refer to the online
documentation and Help files for more details about this command.

STATUS
======
