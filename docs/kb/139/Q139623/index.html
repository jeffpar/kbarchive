SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using a real-mode network client, such as the Novell VLM or NETX
network client, or the Banyan Vines real-mode network client, the screen may
turn black and leave the pointer flashing in the upper-left corner when you
attempt to quit Windows. After several minutes, you may receive the following
error message:

  General failure reading device NETWORK

This problem occurs independent of the type of computer and network interface
card you are using and independent of the real-mode network client you are
using.

CAUSE
=====

This is a known problem with Windows and Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 and
later that occurs when network traffic is unusually heavy.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows versions 3.1 and 3.11
and Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1 and 3.11. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
