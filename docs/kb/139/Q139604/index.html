A.  Installation Notes

Troubleshooting Microsoft Golf Setup
Below are the four most common errors encountered while installing
Microsoft Golf. Follow the instructions for each error message you
encountered while trying to install Microsoft Golf, and then run
Setup again.

**An Intel 386 or higher processor**

You must either upgrade to an Intel 386 or higher processor, or
switch to a computer with an Intel 386 or higher processor.

**Windows version 3.1 or later**

You must install Microsoft Windows version 3.1 or later. To purchase
a Windows upgrade, see your local retailer.

**A 256-color video driver (minimum 640 x 480 display resolution)**

Microsoft Golf high-resolution golf courses require a 256-color video
display. In most cases you need only install a 256-color video driver
to correct the problem.

IMPORTANT: Use the File Manager to copy and rename the SYSTEM.INI
file before following this procedure. For your protection, do not
make changes to the original SYSTEM.INI file in case you need to
restore it later. To install a video driver in Windows 3.1:

In the Main group of the Windows Program Manager, double-click the
Windows Setup icon.
Click the Options menu, and then click Change System Settings.
Under Display, click a 256-color driver that is compatible with
your computer's video card.
NOTE: If you are unsure which 256-color driver is compatible with
your video card, try the generic Super VGA driver, or contact your
video-card manufacturer for more information
Click OK.
Restart Windows to update the system.
Reinstall Microsoft Golf.

To change the palette to 256 colors in Windows 95:
Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
Double-click the Display icon.
Click the Settings tab.
Under Color Palette, click 256 color.
Click OK.
Reinstall Microsoft Golf.

NOTE: If you don't have the necessary 256-color driver, or if you
aren't sure that your video card supports 256 colors, contact your
video-card manufacturer.

To obtain Super VGA drivers:
Download the SVGA drivers from the Microsoft Download Service (MSDL).
These drivers work correctly on many video cards. The phone number
for MSDL is (425) 936-6735. This service is available 24 hours a day,
7 days a week. The highest download speed available is 14,400 bits
per second (bps). Each file is a compressed, self-extracting file. To
download the file, download the filename SVGA.EXE. After you download
the file, run it in an empty directory to extract the files it
contains.

**Windows running in 386 enhanced mode (applies only to Windows 3.1
users)**

Windows requires 2 megabytes (MB) of RAM to run in enhanced mode. If
you have 8 MB of RAM, as required by Microsoft Golf, and are unable
to run Windows in enhanced mode, you may need to reconfigure your
computer. You can determine if Windows is running in standard or
enhanced mode by clicking About on the Help menu.

NOTE: If you are unsure how much RAM your computer has, you can run
Microsoft Diagnostics (MSD), or check with the manufacturer of you
computer. For more information about running MSD, see your Windows
User's Guide.

If your computer has the required 8 MB of RAM and won't run in
enhanced mode, contact Microsoft Windows support at 1-425-637-7098.

If your computer has the required 8 MB of RAM, and you are an
advanced computer user, you may try removing some TSRs from your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file and editing your CONFIG.SYS file to make more
memory available to Windows.

Below are examples of clean boot AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files
that should make enough memory available for Windows to run in
enhanced mode.

IMPORTANT: Use the File Manager to copy and rename your AUTOEXEC.BAT
and CONFIG.SYS files in case you need to restore your current
configuration.

Example for a clean boot AUTOEXEC.BAT file:
Path=c:\;c:\dos;c:\windows
Prompt $p$g
Set Temp=c:\temp(make sure it points to a valid temp directory)
Include any command lines necessary for audio cards, CD-ROM drives,
or hard-disk compression utilities.

Example for a clean boot CONFIG.SYS file:
Device=c:\windows\himem.sys
Files=65
Buffers=20
Stacks=9,256
Shell=c:\dos\command.com c:\dos\ /p /e:256
Include any command lines necessary for audio cards, CD-ROM drives,
or hard-disk compression utilities.

Installing Microsoft Golf on Windows NT
You must have Windows NT 3.51 or higher to install Microsoft Golf. If
you are using Windows NT 3.5, contact your retailer for an upgrade.

Installing Microsoft Golf from a Third-Party Shell
Follow these instructions if you are having trouble installing
Microsoft Golf from a shell program such as Packard Bell Navigator,
Xsoft TabWorks, or Norton Desktop.

IMPORTANT: Use the File Manager to copy and rename the SYSTEM.INI
file before following this procedure. For your protection, do not
make changes to the original SYSTEM.INI file in case you need to
restore it later.

In the Accessories group of Windows Program Manager, double-click
the Notepad icon.
On the File menu, click Open.
In the File Name box, type:  system.ini
Click OK.
Under [Boot], find the 'Shell=' line.
Type a semicolon at the beginning of the 'Shell=' line. (This
remarks out the line.)
Create a new line under 'Shell=' and type:  Shell=Progman.exe
On the File menu, click Save.
On the File menu, click Exit.
Restart Windows, and then install Microsoft Golf.

After you've installed Microsoft Golf, follow steps 1 to 5 above, and
then delete the semicolon from the first 'Shell=' line. Type a
semicolon at the beginning of the 'Shell=Progman.exe' line you added
to remark out the line.

Using a Clean Boot to Resolve Setup Conflicts
If you are unable to install Microsoft Golf, you can edit your
AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, and WIN.INI files and use a clean boot to
make more memory available to Windows.

IMPORTANT: Use the File Manager to copy and rename the AUTOEXEC.BAT,
CONFIG.SYS, and WIN.INI files before following this procedure. For
your protection, do not make changes to the original files in case
you need to restore them later.

In the Main group of Windows Program Manager, double-click the
File Manager icon.
Double-click the Windows directory.
Open the AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, and WIN.INI files and edit out
unnecessary command lines. Refer to the following examples for what
to leave in the files.
On the File menu, click Save.
On the File menu, click Exit.
Restart Windows, and then install Microsoft Golf.

Examples:

AUTOEXEC.BAT
Path=c:\;c:\dos;c:\windows
Prompt $p$g
Set Temp=c:\temp (make sure it points to a valid temp directory)
Include any command lines necessary for audio cards, CD-ROM drives,
or hard-disk compression utilities.

CONFIG.SYS
Device=c:\windows\himem.sys
Files=65
Buffers=20
Stacks=9,256
Shell=c:\dos\command.com c:\dos\ /p /e:256
Include any command lines necessary for audio cards, CD-ROM drives,
or hard-disk compression utilities.

WIN.INI
Type a semicolon in front of the 'Load=' line and the 'Run=' line in
the 'Windows' category to remark out the lines.

NOTE: Remarking out the lines only has to be done if there are
commands on the lines.

Rename the Startup group if any programs are being loaded through it.

Resolving Setup Freezes During Installation
If Setup stalls during installation, and you are running MS-DOS 6.0
or later, run Scandisk followed by Defrag /f. For information about
these two commands, see the MS-DOS User's Guide. After the commands
are completed, restart Windows, and then install Microsoft Golf.

If you are not running MS-DOS 6.0 or later, you can use the Chkdsk /f
command. You can then use a defragmentation utility such as PC Tools
or Norton Desktop.

Starting Microsoft Golf If You Are Using the PC Tools Desktop
If you are using PC Tools Desktop as your Windows shell, you will
need to restart Windows manually after installing Microsoft Golf.
Just exit Windows and type Win at the prompt.

Notes on Uninstalling Golf on Windows 3.1
On some systems, uninstalling Golf from Windows 3.1 can leave
unnecessary files and subfolders in the Golf folder. You can safely
delete these.

Uninstalling Golf on Windows NT 3.51
To uninstall Golf from Windows NT 3.51, double-click SETUP.EXE from
the GLFSETUP subfolder in the GOLFCD folder. Follow the directions on
the screen.

Late-Breaking Installation Notes
When installing Golf on Windows 3.1 systems you might encounter a
system error if there is not enough memory to install all of the
selected installation options. To avoid a system error, select fewer
installation options in the Custom Installation dialog box, or cancel
Setup and free-up enough space for the options selected.

B.  PlayerNet and Multiplayer Game Notes

Installing PlayerNet
If you choose the Typical Golf installation option from Golf Setup,
PlayerNet Setup will automatically start after Golf installation is
complete. If you choose the Custom installation option and choose not
to install PlayerNet, you cannot add it later using Golf Setup.
Instead, double-click SETUP.EXE in the PLAYERNET folder of the
Multimedia Golf 2.0 CD.

PlayerNet and Plus! 95 Internet AutoDial
If the Plus! 95 Internet AutoDial feature is interfering with making
PlayerNet connections, turn off AutoDial. To turn off AutoDial, click
the Windows 95 Start button, point to Settings, and click Control
Panel. Double-click the Internet icon. On the AutoDial tab of the
Internet Properties dialog box, click Use AutoDial to clear the check
box.

More on PlayerNet
When the start-up procedure for a PlayerNet game is cancelled for any
reason, be sure that all message boxes that may have been displayed
are closed before the Host attempts to restart a game. If you are
still having trouble, close Golf and wait for an invitation to play
in PlayerNet. If you are still having difficulty being connected to a
PlayerNet game, close Golf and PlayerNet, restart PlayerNet and then
start a new game from PlayerNet.

It is recommended that all players in a multiplayer Game have
different names. It may cause problems to have more than one player
with the same name when saving and playing saved games.

NOTE: For additional late-breaking PlayerNet information, consult the
file PLAYRNET.TXT in the PLAYERNET folder.

C. Hardware and System Compatibility

Increasing Your Swap File
Microsoft Golf requires at least 8 MB of RAM and an 8-MB swap file
(preferably permanent). Be sure that the swap file is set for a
minimum of 8 MB. Increasing the swap-file size may improve the
performance of Microsoft Golf.

Follow this procedure to increase the swap file if your computer has
enough disk space:

In the Main Group of Windows Program Manager, double-click the
Control Panel icon.
Double-click the 386 Enhanced icon.
Click Virtual Memory.
Click Change.
Increase the size of the swap file.

Follow this procedure to increase the swap file if your computer is
low on disk space and you are running MS-DOS 6.0 or later:

In the Main group of Windows Program Manager, double-click the
Control Panel icon.
Double-click the 386 Enhanced icon.
Click Virtual Memory.
Click Change.
Under New Swapfile Settings, type None in the Type box.
Click OK in both dialog boxes.
Close Windows.
At the MS-DOS prompt, run Scandisk, and then Defrag. For
information about these two commands, see the MS-DOS User's Guide.
Once these commands are completed, restart Windows. Increase the
virtual memory using the previous procedure.

NOTE:  If you are unable to create an 8 MB swap file using this
procedure, you can delete files from the hard disk, and then try the
procedure again.

If you are not using MS-DOS 6.0 or later, you can use the Chkdsk /f
command to check your swap file size. You can then use a
defragmentation utility such as PCTOOLS or Norton.

Improving Performance on Machines with 8 MB of RAM
If performance is slow on your computer with 8 MB of RAM, the
following tips may help:

* Increase the size of your swap file (see Increasing Your Swap File).
* Close some of the Microsoft Golf windows (for example, if both Main
View and Green View are displayed, then close Green View).
* Reduce the size of Main View.
* Modify options in the Display Options dialog box:
On the Options menu, click Display.
Clear the Render Full Size check box.
Clear the Draw Shadows check box.
Clear the Texture Terrain check box.
Reduce the Terrain Detail levels.
When you turn off Texture Terrain and reduce the Terrain Detail
levels, you affect the appearance of the course -- do this only if
speed is more important than appearance.
* Use the clean boot configuration (see Using a Clean Boot to Resolve
Setup Conflicts). Change the clean boot so that it:
- Loads the minimal number of memory-resident drivers and programs
needed to run Windows.
- Does not enable expanded memory (EMM386 should be configured for NOEMS).
- Does not load SmartDrive (this becomes a trade-off between more
memory and slower hard-disk performance -- on some systems this may
lead to slower game play).

*Install more memory in your machine to speed up Microsoft Golf. 8 MB
of RAM is recommended.

Growstub Error
Use the following procedure if you get a growstub error message.

IMPORTANT: Use the File Manager to copy and rename the WIN.INI file
before following this procedure. For your protection, do not make
changes to the original WIN.INI file in case you need to restore it
later.

Click the Accessories group of Windows Program Manager, and then
double-click Notepad.
On the File menu, click Open.
In the File Name box, type:  win.ini.
Find the 'Load=' line under the 'Window' category.
Delete 'Pointer.exe' part of the 'Load=' line.
On the File menu, click Save.
On the File menu, click Exit.
Restart Windows, and then restart Microsoft Golf.

EMM 386 Exception Error
Use the following procedure if you get an EMM 386 exception error.

IMPORTANT: Use the File Manager to copy and rename the WIN.INI file
before following this procedure. For your protection, do not make
changes to the original WIN.INI file in case you need to restore it
later.

Click the Accessories group of Windows Program Manager, and then
double-click Notepad.
On the File menu, click Open.
In the File Name box, type:  win.ini.
Click OK.
Find the 'Load=' line under the 'Window' category.
Delete the 'Pointer.exe' command part of the 'Load=' line.
NOTE: For some Packard Bell computers, you may also need to remove
the 'Mapiappi.exe' command part of the 'Run=' line.
On the File menu, click Save.
On the File menu, click Exit.
Restart Windows, and then restart Microsoft Golf.

Win32s Error
To resolve this error, you need to create a larger swap file. See
Increasing Your Swap File for instructions.

E. Midi Notes

Playing Midi Files on Older Windows 3.1 Systems
Older Windows 3.1 systems may not be able to play the Midi files that
accompany fly-bys due to older midi mapping conventions. To hear the
midi music, either use an existing midi map that has channels 1-10
already assigned to a device, or reassign channels 1-10 of the
current map to a valid device. For more information on changing your
midi mapping consult your Windows documentation.
