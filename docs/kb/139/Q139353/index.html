-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Schedule+ for Windows, you may receive the following error:

  STOP: A Problem Occurred Initializing MSSCHED.DLL, which prevents Microsoft
  Schedule+ from running.


CAUSE
=====

This error is not actually caused by the MSSCHED.DLL file, but it may be caused
by one of the following:

- The file TRNSCHED.DLL is not present, is corrupt, is not accessible through
  the path statement, or has been renamed.

- The SCHEDULETRANSPORT= entry in the SCHDPLUS.INI is incorrect. The correct
  setting should be the one of the following:

  SCHEDULETRANSPORT=TRNSCHED.DLL

  -OR-

  SCHEDULETRANSPORT=TRNSCHED

  If the above line contains a path to the file (for example,
  C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\TRNSCHED.DLL), even if it is the correct path, it will not
  work. The SCHEDULETRANSPORT entry cannot have a path of any kind.

  Notes:

   - The SCHEDULETRANSPORT= line does not have to be present in the INI file.
     Schedule+ is designed so that it will look for TRNSCHED.DLL by default.

   - The TRNSCHED.DLL file provides access to local and postoffice calendar
     files (*.CAL)

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure that the TRNSCHED.DLL is present, or its directory is in the path
statement. If the file is present and/or in the path statement, check the
SCHDPLUS.INI for the correct spelling of the SCHEDULETRANSPORT line. The section
in the SCHDPLUS.INI file should be the following:

  [Microsoft Schedule+]
  SCHEDULETRANSPORT = TRNSCHED.DLL

Additional query words: 1.00 mssched.dll initializing schedule plus
