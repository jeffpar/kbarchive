SYMPTOMS
========

When you choose to Shutdown and Restart from the Windows NT 3.51 logon screen,
the 3Com 3C59X.SYS driver fails to initialize the 3Com 3C590 or 3C595 network
interface card (NIC). The system reboots, but when you log into Windows NT, you
are notified that "a service or driver has failed to start," and the network is
unavailable. The following events may also appear in the Event Log:

  EVENT ID 5000: Source: El59x Type: Error Error: El59x1 : Has encountered a
  conflict in resources and could not load.

  EVENT ID 7000: Source: Service Control Manager Type: Error Error: The 3Com
  Fast Etherlink/Etherlink III Adapter Driver service failed to start due to
  the following error: A device attached to the system is not functioning.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the 3Com 3C59X.SYS driver does not reset the NIC on
Windows NT shutdown. When Windows NT restarts, the driver is not able to locate
the NIC.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

- Restart the computer by turning the power off, and then back on.

  -or-

- Enable the resetting of the PCI bus during "warm boots" in the computer's
  CMOS setup (This feature is available on some computers).

  -or-

- Use another supported NIC. Refer to the latest Windows NT 3.51 Hardware
  Compatibility List (HCL).
