SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses directory replication to a domain name in a Wide Area
Network (WAN) environment, why import computers located across a router or
bridge may not receive notification, and the procedures for configuring these
computers to receive replicated data.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 459 of the Windows NT "Server System Guide" (in the Managing Directory
Replication section) states that replication to a domain name does not always
succeed when some or all of the replication import computers are located across
a wide area network (WAN) bridge from an export server. When adding names to the
export list on an export server, and when adding names to the import list on an
import computer, for those computers separated by a WAN bridge you should
specify the computer names (instead of or in addition to specifying the domain
name).

The details of why this is documented and how replication works in this situation
are as follows:

When the option to export directories is chosen, and no entries exist in the "To
List", the export server defaults to exporting to the local domain. From the
export server, mailslots addressed to "\MAILSLOT\NET\REPL_CLI" are broadcast to
a multicast address, and if in a TCP/IP environment, a broadcast is sent to the
subnet on which the export server resides. Included in the Server Message Block
(SMB) is the name of the domain the export server is broadcasting for. An import
computer listening for this broadcast responds and sets up a replication session
if the import computers domain name equals that of the destination domain name
included in the packet. However, import computers that are configured to import
from the domain, but are across routers or bridges from where these broadcasts
are not forwarded do not receive notification from the export server, and do not
receive replicated data.

To replicate directories to import computers across the router or bridge, add the
NetBIOS name of the computer to the "To List" on the export server. When the
replication interval occurs, the NetBIOS name is resolved and a mailslot
addressed to "\MAILSLOT\NET\REPL_CLI" is directed at the import computer
specified.
