1. Where to Find Help

Check the Cinemania 96 online Help for information on how to use
Cinemania or for tips and troubleshooting topics on issues such as
improving performance or resolving audio difficulties.

In most areas of Cinemania, Help is available via the Help menu. At
the upper-right corner of the Cinemania Window click the Help button
to see the Help menu, then choose Help (or press F1). In areas where
the Help menu is unavailable, click the orange Help button (or press
F1).

2. Most Problems Are Easily Solved

Cinemania supports the Windows 95 AutoPlay feature and will start
Cinemania automatically when you put the Cinemania 96 CD in your CD-
ROM drive. As Cinemania starts, it automatically checks for all files
it needs, makes sure your display and sound card are set up in a
fashion Cinemania can use, and makes sure everything is generally in
order.

As a result, the easiest way to cure any problems you encounter is to
quit Cinemania, remove the CD from your CD-ROM drive, and then re-
insert it. As Cinemania starts up, it should be able to fix most
problems you might have encountered. If it doesn't, see the other
items in this Read Me or the Tips and Troubleshooting section of
online Help.

3. Improving Performance

Make sure that Windows 95 is optimized for your CD-ROM drive. Windows
95 provides settings for CD caching and for accessing various CD-ROM
drive speeds.

To review and modify these settings:

  1. Select the "My Computer" icon on your desktop and click it with
     the secondary mouse button (usually the right mouse button).

  2. Choose Properties.

  3. Choose the Performance tab.

  4. Choose the File System button.

   5. Choose the CD-ROM tab.

In this box, make sure that the Supplemental Cache size is set to
"Large." Also, verify that the Optimize access pattern is correctly
set for the type of CD-ROM drive that is installed on your system
(single-speed, double-speed, etc.).

4. Tips on Working with Old Versions of Cinemania

Removing Cinemania '95
If you have Cinemania '95 installed on your machine and want to remove
it, run Setup from the Cinemania '95 CD and select the Remove All
button.

You may also need to do the following:

-  If Cinemania '95 Setup cannot find the Cinemania program icon in
   your Start menu, you will have to delete it manually.

-  Setup will not remove the CINMANIA.INI file. Use the Explorer to
   delete the CINMANIA.INI file from your Windows directory.

-  The CIN95 directory (or whichever directory you selected as the
   destination directory during setup) will not be removed. If this
   directory is not being used for other files, use the Explorer to
   delete the directory.

5.  Making Photographs and Videos Look their Best

The color photographs and video clips in Cinemania 96 are stored in
24-bit color and will look their best if your display is set to show
True Color (24-bit). For details on changing your display settings,
see your Windows documentation.

6.  Video Cards and Display Problems

Less than 256 Colors
Cinemania 96 will not run if your display is set to 16-color mode-it
is designed to run at 640x480 resolution or higher, with 256 colors or
more. If your display is set to show 16 colors, change your display
settings to show 256 colors or more. For details on changing your
display settings, see your Windows documentation.

More than 256 Colors
Some video cards may encounter problems when using accelerated video
drivers, video drivers with more than 256 colors, or high resolution
video drivers.

If you run into display problems:

1) Try switching to a driver supplied by Windows 95 or Windows NT.

2) Change to a different display mode. An alternative to using a
  different driver is to change your video mode to a standard video
  mode such as 640x480 resolution with 256 colors.

For details on how to change drivers or switch to a different display
mode, see your Windows documentation.

Specific Driver Issues

Creative Labs Sound Blaster 16/16ASP
Audio in Cinemania may not play if you are using a Sound Blaster 16 or
Sound Blaster 16 ASP sound card. This problem occurs because some
computers are unable to use the 16-bit DMA (direct memory access)
channel on the Sound Blaster cards.

To correct this problem, switch the HDMA channel to use DMA or 8-bit
DMA. See your Sound Blaster documentation or contact Creative Labs for
information on how to change this setting.

Turtle Beach Monte Carlo
When using the Turtle Beach Monte Carlo sound card, sounds may play
correctly the first time, then fail on subsequent attempts. To correct
this problem, run the Monte Carlo driver utility and change the setup
to use the Standard drivers and not the V-synth driver. Audio clips
should now play correctly.

For additional information about using Turtle Beach drivers, see your
sound card documentation.

Roland Rap-10
When using the Roland Rap-10 sound card you may experience problems
playing compressed audio (most audio in Cinemania is compressed). To
correct this problem, make sure that you are using Roland Toolworks
software version 3.7 or later.

Dell S3 drivers, versions 1.3 and 1.3a
If you have a Dell computer with S3 video and are using Dell S3 video
driver version 1.3 or 1.3a, you should install the latest driver. To
get the latest driver, contact the manufacturer.

ATI Ultra Crystal video driver
The ATI Ultra Crystal driver will allow you to select a 256-color,
1024x768 display for a video card that has 512K of memory. However,
512K of memory will not support 256 colors at this resolution. Because
Cinemania 96 requires 256 colors to run properly, you must select a
driver that will support a 256-color display. You must also make sure
the video driver is compatible with your specific video card. For
details on selecting an appropriate driver, see your ATI documentation
or contact ATI technical support.

If you have a modem, you can obtain the latest 256-color SVGA driver
from the Microsoft Download Service at (206) 936-6735.

7. CD-ROM Problems

Ejecting the CD while the application is running
Do not remove the CD-ROM disc while you are running Cinemania 96.

If you eject the Cinemania 96 disc from the CD-ROM drive while running
Cinemania 96, insert a disc for another program, then click hot text
(say, a movie title in a review), you get the System Error message:
"Error reading CD-ROM in Drive &lt;drive letter&gt;:" and then the
instructions: "Please insert CD-ROM CIN96."

Reinsert the Cinemania 96 disc, then choose Enter.

Conflicts with the CD-ROM drive
In Windows 95, you can check for conflicts with your CD-ROM by
clicking on the My Computer icon with the right mouse button and
selecting Properties. On the System Properties screen select the
Device Manager tab and look for the CD-ROM drive in the list. If it
appears with an exclamation point to the right of it, there is a
conflict with the hardware setup. Check the manuals that came with
your CD-ROM drive for information on how to set up your CD-ROM drive
or contact the manufacturer.

CD-ROM drive conflicts with Windows 95 AutoPlay feature
AutoPlay is a Windows 95 feature that starts an application when you
put the application CD in your CD-ROM drive. If Cinemania does not
start automatically, your CD-ROM drive does not support AutoPlay, or
the AutoPlay feature is disabled. To start Cinemania 96 manually,
insert the Cinemania 96 CD-ROM, open Explorer and select the Cinemania
96 icon or list item. Double-click Cinmania.exe and Cinemania 96 will
start. Cinemania will also create an icon in your Start menu; to start
Cinemania in the future, simply insert the Cinemania CD and select the
Cinemania icon from your Start menu.

Future Domain SCSI Card
The Future Domain SCSI Card and its driver FDCD.SYS do not work
correctly with Windows 95. If you have a Future Domain SCSI card and
experience sound stuttering, contact Future Domain for an updated
FDCD.SYS driver.

To find out if you are using this card and its driver, right-click the
My Computer icon on your desktop and select Properties. Choose the
Device Manager tab, select the SCSI controllers entry, and then choose
Properties.

8. Audio Problems

The Tips and Troubleshooting section in the Cinemania 96 online Help
contains useful information on resolving common problems with audio.

Error Message: "All wave devices that can play files in the current
format are in use. . ."
If Microsoft SoundBits (or a similar sound-producing program) is
installed and enabled, you will not hear any startup audio with
Cinemania 96 and you will get the message "All wave devices that can
play files in the current format are in use. Wait until a wave device
is free, and then try again." This occurs because both SoundBits and
Cinemania are trying to play audio at the same time. To disable
SoundBits, select the Sound icon from the Control Panel and select
Your Old Scheme from the Window Schemes list box.

Stuttering Audio
If audio appears to echo or stutter, check the "CD-ROM Problems:
Conflicts with the CD-ROM drive" section above. Some SCSI cards are
known to conflict with Windows 95 and will cause audio to stutter if
the CD-ROM drive is plugged into this SCSI card.

9. Removing Cinemania 96 Preferences and Shortcuts

Although Cinemania doesn't install any parts of the application on
your hard disk, it does store preferences and shortcuts on it.

Windows 95
If you want to remove these, you can delete them with the Add/Remove
Programs control panel. For details on using the Add/Remove Programs
control panel, see your Windows documentation.

Note: Because the Add/Remove Programs control panel uses some files on
the Cinemania CD to delete preferences and shortcuts, you must put the
Cinemania 96 CD in your CD-ROM drive before opening this control
panel.

Windows NT
&gt;From Program Manager, select File and then Run. In the Command Line
edit box, type d:\data\app\uninstal.exe /uninstall, (where d: is the
name of your CD drive letter).

You will need to delete the Cinemania program icon from the Microsoft
Multimedia program group (or whichever program group you may have used
for Cinemania).

10. Installing Cinemania 96 on a Windows NT System

Log on as an administrator
Since Cinemania may require some changes to the system, it may not run
correctly on a Windows NT system while you're logged on as a user. To
work around this, you should log on as an administrator.

Font display problems
Some articles in Cinemania require special fonts to display the full
topic correctly. If text does not display correctly in Cinemania, you
should make sure that all the fonts are installed properly.

To install the required fonts:

1. Select Fonts from the Control Panel (usually found in the Program
  Manager Main group).
2. In the Fonts dialog, select Add.

3. Locate the Cinemania 96 CD and navigate to the \data\setup
  directory. The fonts included on the CD will be displayed in the
  dialog.

4. Choose Select All and click OK.
