The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the SET RELATION TO and SET SKIP TO commands to relate a parent
table into many records in a child table that relates to many records in a
grandchild table, the view window may actually indicate that a one-to-one
relationship exists from the child table into the grandchild table.

CAUSE
=====

The display of the relation between the child and grandchild table in the view
window is incorrect.

WORKAROUND
==========

To determine if the relation is constructed properly, use the BROWSE FIELDS or
LIST FIELDS command with fields from the parent, child, and grandchild tables to
verify that the relation is correct.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
