-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Golf for Windows, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start a new Golf game, if you are trying to use a low-resolution
course, you will receive the following message:

  Microsoft Golf has detected Lo-Res courses. These courses need to be
  converted for use with Microsoft Golf 2.0. Please consult your Microsoft Golf
  2.0 manual or the online help for instructions on how to convert these
  courses.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you receive this message, you must convert any low-resolution courses (.crs)
you want to use with Microsoft Golf 2.0 to high-resolution courses (.crh).

The following steps describe how to start the Course Converter in Windows 95 and
Windows 3.x. After the converter starts, see the Using Course Converter section
in this article.

Starting Course Converter
-------------------------

Windows 95:

NOTE: The following instructions assume you installed Golf to the Microsoft
Sports folder.

- Click Start, point to Programs, point to Microsoft Sports, and then click
  Course Converter.

Windows 3.1:

NOTE: The following instructions assume you installed Golf to the Microsoft
Sports program group.

1. In Program Manager, open the Microsoft Games program group.

2. Double-click the Course Converter icon.

Using Course Converter
----------------------

To convert a low-resolution course to a high resolution course, do the
following:

1. In the Course Converter dialog box, click Browse.

2. In the Source File dialog box, use the Folders or Directories list and the
  Drives list to locate the course file that you want to convert.

3. From the File Name list, select the file name of the course (the filename has
  a .crs file extension).

4. Click OK.

5. Click Convert.

6. The course conversion process starts. You receive a message when the process
  completes.

Repeat steps 1 through 6 for each low-resolution course you are using.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Low-resolution courses have a .crs file extension and high-resolution courses
have a .crh file extension. When the course conversion completes, a new file
with a .crh file extension is created in your MSGOLF2 folder or directory. The
Course Converter does not delete the low resolution course that was converted;
you may want to delete the original course file after you convert course files.
