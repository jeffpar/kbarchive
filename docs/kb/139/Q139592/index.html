-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition 
- Microsoft Windows 95 
- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 
- Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
- Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect to a Windows NT-based or Windows 2000-based
computer, you may receive one of the following messages:

- Incorrect password or unknown username for:

- You must supply a password to make this connection.

- \\&lt;ComputerName&gt;\&lt;ShareName&gt; is not accessible. Access Denied.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when all of the following conditions exist:

- The Guest account is disabled on the Windows NT-based computer you are
  attempting to connect to.

- The user name and password you are using are not contained in the local user
  accounts database of the Windows NT-based computer you are attempting to
  connect to.

- If the computer you are attempting to connect to is a member of a domain, the
  user name and password you are using are not contained in that domain's user
  accounts database.

For example, if the user has logged into an account on the local machine, that
account is not in the domain user accounts database. Even if the username and
password match, the user will not be granted access.
Windows NT uses your logon information (your user name and password) for
authentication when you attempt to connect to a network resource.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, use the appropriate method:

Enable the Guest Account
------------------------

To enable the guest account, use the appropriate method:

Enable Guest Account for Windows 2000:

1. Right-click My Computer, click Manage, and then expand the tree under System
  Tools.

2. Double-click "Local Users and Groups", and then click the Users folder.

3. Double-click the Guest account in the right-side pane, click to clear the
  "Account is disabled" check box, and then click OK.

Enable Guest Account for Windows NT:

Use the User Manager tool to enable the Guest account on the Windows NT- based
computer that you are attempting to connect to. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, click Administrative Tools (Common), and then
  click User Manager or User Manager For Domains.

2. In the Username box, double-click Guest.

3. Click the Account Disabled check box to clear it, and then click OK.

Set Up User Accounts in the Local Accounts Database
---------------------------------------------------

Use the User Manager tool to set up user accounts in the local accounts database
of the Windows NT-based computer that you are attempting to connect to. These
user accounts need to contain the same logon information (user name and
password) that is used when a user logs on to his or her computer.

Set Up User Accounts in the Domain Accounts Database
----------------------------------------------------

Use the User Manager For Domains and Server Manager tools to configure accounts
for your domain. In a domain environment, you typically add users to the
centralized domain accounts database and not to the local accounts database.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, the Guest account is disabled in Windows NT Workstation 4.0 and all
versions of Windows NT Server. In earlier versions of Windows NT Workstation,
the Guest account is enabled by default.
