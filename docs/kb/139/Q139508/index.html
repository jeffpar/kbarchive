SYMPTOMS
========

This article discusses how SNA Server supports Internet Firewalls, including
instructions on the following:

- How to allow SNA Server clients and SNA Servers to interoperate with
  screening routers, where the client does know the address of the SNA
  Server(s).

- How to allow SNA Server clients and SNA Servers to interoperate with
  full-blown Internet firewalls, where the end user is not allowed to know the
  IP address of the SNA Server(s).

OVERVIEW
--------

SNA Server can be configured to use specific software port numbers. Specific port
numbers are commonly defined in software components to allow administrators of
Internet firewalls to filter packets based on port number, thereby
denying/accepting their propagation to the private network. By assigning
specific destination port numbers to SNA Server components, SNA Server can
interoperate with screening routers and full-blown firewalls to meet the
requirement that users of the public network should not know the IP address of
the SNA Server.

I. SNA Server Clients and SNA Servers Interoperation with
Screening Routers (Client knows the address of the SNA Server)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following are the instructions on how to allow SNA Server clients and SNA
Servers to interoperate with screening routers, where the client does know the
address of the SNA Server(s).

Destination port numbers are configurable in SNA Server on the following
platforms:

- Windows NT

- Windows 95

- Windows 3.x

The following transport protocols can be used:

- TCP/IP

- IPX/SPX

- Vines IP

Each transport has the following three components that can have administrator
defined destination ports assigned to them:

- DatagramPort.

  This port is used for datagram (mostly broadcast or multicast) traffic. Use
  the Server Broadcasts dialog in SNA Server Admin to control which transport
  is used for Server to Server communication.

- SnaBasePort.

  This is the port where the server SnaBase listens for new client sponsor
  connections. Sponsor connections are used by the SNA Server client to learn
  about the SNA Server subdomain in which it participates.

- SnaServerPort.

  This is the port where the SNASERVR.EXE waits for new application session
  requests.

NOTE: These parameters are configured on the SNA Server side to control what port
numbers the SnaBase and SNAServr processes use.

The default values for destination port numbers are:

  Port            TCP/IP   IPX/SPX     Vines
  --------------------------------------------
  DatagramPort    1478     0x84C8      381
  SnaBasePort     1478     0x84C8      381
  SnaServerPort   1477     0x84C9      dynamic

There is no need to change any of these ports except when it is necessary to run
each SNA Server service and SNABase service with a unique port number. It is the
administrator[ASCII 146]s responsibility to make sure that the ports are not
used by other applications on the network.

NOTE: The DatagramPort must be the same in every server in a subdomain.

On Windows NT, the ports are configured in the registry under the subtree
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE under the subkey:

  System\CurrentControlSet\Services\SnaBase\Parameters\&lt;transport&gt;\ 

where &lt;transport&gt; is SnaTcp, SnaSpx, or SnaVines.

Add the following value name under the &lt;transport&gt; subkey:

  " Value Name: &lt;port&gt;
  Data Type: REG_DWORD" (without the quotation marks)

where &lt;port&gt; is DatagramPort or SnaBasePort.

On Windows 95, the ports are configured in the registry under the subtree
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE under the subkey:

  Software\Microsoft\SnaBase\Parameters\&lt;transport&gt;\ 

where &lt;transport&gt; is SnaTcp, SnaSpx, or SnaVines.

Add the following value name under the &lt;transport&gt; subkey:

  "Value Name: &lt;port&gt;
  Data Type: REG_DWORD" (without the quotation marks)

where &lt;port&gt; is DatagramPort or SnaBasePort.

On Windows 3.x, the ports are configured in the WIN.INI file under the [WNAP]
section:

  [WNAP]
  &lt;port&gt;=&lt;value&gt;

where &lt;port&gt; is DatagramPort or SnaBasePort and value is the port number
either in decimal or hexadecimal notation.

Remote TCP/IP Clients:

For TCP/IP it is not enough just to add one SnaBasePort number to the WIN.INI
file or registry in Windows NT or Windows 95. Because every SNA Server in the
subdomain is potentially using a different destination port number, every
sponsor server requires its own entry. To make this possible, the port names can
be prefixed with a server name. For example, if the SnaBase service on the
server Server_A is using destination port 1234 and the server Server_B is using
destination port number 5678, you need to add the following entries into the
WIN.INI file or registry:

Windows NT or Windows 95 registry:

  Server_ASnaBasePort:REG_DWORD:1234
  Server_BSnaBasePort:REG_DWORD:5678

Windows 3.x WIN.INI file:

  Server_ASnaBasePort=1234
  Server_BSnaBasePort=5678

The clients get the SnaServer ports through the sponsor connection. On IPX/SPX
and Vines IP, the clients get the SnaBase ports from the NetWare bindery and
Vines StreetTalk respectively. There is no need to configure any port numbers on
these two client types.

OtherServers:

When you use the OtherServers parameter, use the following convention in the
WIN.INI file under the [WNAP] section:

  [WNAP]
  &lt;server_nameX&gt;SnaServerPort=3333
  &lt;server_nameY&gt;SnaServerPort=4444

You still need to include the following entry in this section:

  Otherservers=&lt;server_nameX&gt; &lt;servernameY&gt;

II. SNA Server Clients and SNA Servers Interoperation with Full-Blown
Internet firewalls (Client Cannot Know the IP address of the SNA Server(s))
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following are the instructions on how to allow SNA Server clients and SNA
Servers to interoperate with full-blown Internet firewalls, where the client is
not allowed to know the IP address of the SNA Server(s).

First, follow directions in section I. above. Then, add the following entry to
the respective platform:

Windows NT:

1. In the registry, go to the subtree HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE under the following
  subkey:

System\CurrentControlSet\Services\SnaBase\Parameters\SnaTcp\ 

2. Add the following information:

"

  Value Name: FireWall
  Data Type:  REG_MULTI_SZ
  Data:       &lt;list of firewall IP addresses&gt;

" (without the quotation marks)
Windows 95:

1. In the registry, go to the subtree HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE under the following
  subkey:

Software\Microsoft\SnaBase\Parameters\SnaTcp\ 

2. Add the following information: "

  Value Name: FireWall
  Data Type:  REG_SZ
  Data:       &lt;list of firewall IP addresses&gt;

  " (without the quotation marks) where Reg_SZ equates to STRING.

  NOTE: The list can be separated by spaces, commas, or semicolons.

Windows 3.x:

1. Add the following information in the WIN.INI file under the [WNAP] section:

"

     [WNAP]
     FireWall =&lt;list of firewall IP addresses&gt;

" (without the quotation marks)
The SNA Server IP transport replaces the real destination IP address with a
firewall address when it opens a connection to an SNA Server for both
application sessions or sponsor connection.

Microsoft has updated the following files:

  LIBS\WIN32\SNAIP.DLL
  LIBS\WIN32\SNANW.DLL
  LIBS\WIN32\SNABV.DLL
  LIBS\WIN95\SNACIP.DLL
  LIBS\WIN95\SNACNW.DLL
