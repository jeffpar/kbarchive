-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Multimedia Viewer, versions 2.0, 2.0a 
- the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
- the operating system: Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to play compressed audio on some computers using the Aztech
16-bit or Reveal SC400 sound card (Aztech SG16/NX Pro 16), you experience sound
problems. Some of the problems include poor audio quality, scratchy sound, or
other sound-related symptoms.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows 95/98 drivers for Aztech 16-bit sound cards have 2 Low DMA
channels:0, 1, or 3. You can not disable the second channel and there is only
one Basic Configuration to choose from.


RESOLUTION
==========

Use the Windows 3.x Aztech drivers. The Windows 3.x drivers for Aztech cards
have an 8-bit and 16-bit DMA setting. The HDMA can be set to 5, 6, 7 or None.

Selecting the 16-bit DMA setting may help resolve scratchy or poor sound
problems. Selecting None may help resolve system crashes or General Protection
Fault problems.

Replacing Windows 95/98 Driver with Windows 3.x Driver
------------------------------------------------------

To remove the 32-bit driver and install the original Windows 3.1 driver, follow
these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the System icon, and then click the Device Manager tab.

3. Double-click Sound, video and game controllers, and then click your sound
  card.

4. Click Remove.

5. Click Start, and then click Shut Down.

6. Click Restart Windows, and then click Yes.

7. Reinstall the original Aztech drivers from your vendor-provided disks. Follow
  the instructions provided by the manufacturer.
