-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you create an edit box in a grid column, enter data in that edit box, and
then click the scroll bar of the grid without exiting the edit box, any of the
following may occur:

- Data may be written to the wrong record.

- Data may be lost.

- Record locking errors may occur.

- Data may be truncated.


CAUSE
=====

The edit box does not close automatically when it loses the focus to the scroll
bar. In some cases, it acts as if it were never open. In other cases, it acts as
if it were open on the record to which the record pointer moved. Odd behavior
may occur if the control source of the edit box is set to either a character
field or a memo field. These behaviors do not occur if you click another cell in
the grid or click an object outside the grid.

WORKAROUND
==========

Trap for the MouseDown event while in the edit box. This can be done by placing
the following code in the MouseDown event of the grid, which fires before the
Scroll event fires:

     IF this.activecolumn = 2    &amp;&amp; or whatever column the edit box is in
        keyboard '{TAB}'         &amp;&amp; or SHIFT-TAB
     ENDIF

This forces the edit box to close properly before the scroll can be run.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a table called Test, and give it a memo field and a text field.

2. Append a few blank records to the table.

3. Create a new form, and add the table to the form's data environment.

4. Drag the table from the data environment onto the form to create a grid.

5. In the grid, set column one's ControlSource property to the text field of the
  table, and set column two's ControlSource property to the memo field of the
  table.

6. Create an edit box for column two, and make the edit box the active control.

7. Run the form, and edit or add data to the edit box. Then click the scroll bar
  without using the TAB key to move out of the edit box. At this point, the
  data may be written to the wrong record, or it may not be written to any
  record. Scroll through the edit box controls to see where the data was
  written. You may receive a record locking error when you click the record
  that seems to have received the data. These behaviors do not occur in every
  single instance nor do all of them occur together.
