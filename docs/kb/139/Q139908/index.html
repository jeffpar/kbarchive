SUMMARY
=======

When troubleshooting a hardware inventory problem, it might be necessary to
disable portions of the hardware detection during the SMS inventory on the
client. This can be accomplished by manually creating a SMSSAFE.TMP file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the Inventory Agent runs, it creates a SMSSAFE.TMP file to keep track of
any hardware failures. This file is stored in the \MS\SMS\DATA directory for SMS
1.1 and 1.2 clients and in the &lt;SMS&gt; root directory for SMS 1.0 clients.

Any failed hardware tests are written into this file while the Inventory Agent
scans the hardware. Then next time the Inventory Agent performs hardware
inventory, it will write any failures recorded in the SMSSAFE.TMP file to the
SMS.INI file in the [WorkstationStatus] section, using the FailedHardwareChecks
keyword.

After moving the failed tests to the SMS.INI file, the SMSSAFE.TMP file is
deleted. When the inventory continues to run it will detect the failed tests in
the SMS.INI file and skip failed hardware tests.

To create a SMSSAFE.TMP file, use a text editor, such as Notepad, and add valid
entries of hardware devices or parameters you want the hardware detection to
bypass (listed below). For example, if you want to bypass the mouse detection,
enter the following in the SMSSAFE.TMP file:

     MouseInfo=CRASHED

The following are valid entries for SMSSAFE.TMP (or FailedHardwareChecks):

Note: The items below are not listed in the same order that the inventory agent
performs them.

When a failed hardware component is fixed or replaced, remove the appropriate
FailedHardwareChecks entry from the [WorkstationStatus] section in SMS.INI and
remove the SMSSAFE.TMP file (if it only referenced one component). Start the
client computer again and run the Inventory Agent to have the component
reinventoried.

NOTE: This functionality does not work with Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000. In
these environments we do not inventory the HW itself, but instead look in the
registry for the hardware information. This new way of inventorying clients does
not result in machine hangs. Therefore, this functionality is unnecessary.
