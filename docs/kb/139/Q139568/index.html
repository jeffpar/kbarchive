SUMMARY
=======

Using the Dock method of the ToolBar class, you can cause the toolbar to dock
automatically when the formset is displayed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To have a toolbar that was added to your formset automatically dock when the
formset is run, place code in the Init event of the toolbar to call the Dock
method to dock the toolbar.

Either of the following commands can be placed in the Init event of the toolbar
to force the toolbar to dock at the top of the screen:

     This.Dock(0)

-or-

     ThisFormSet.&lt;name property of toolbar object&gt;.Dock(0)

You can also dock the toolbar to the left, right, top, bottom, or a set of
coordinates by using a different number or set of numbers. To undock the
toolbar, use the -1 parameter, as in this example:

     This.Dock(-1)

For information on how to add a toolbar to your form or formset, please refer to
page 345 of the "Microsoft Visual FoxPro Developer's Guide," in the "Adding
Custom Toolbars to Form Sets" section. You can also drag a toolbar that you have
created from your project's Classes tab to the form. If the form is not a
formset, a dialog box will appear that asks:

  A formset object is required to add a form. Create one?

Clicking Yes will create the necessary formset, and you will have a form with a
toolbar.

Syntax of the Dock Method
-------------------------

  ToolBar.Dock [nLocation [, X, Y]]

nLocation - Specifies where the ToolBar is docked. The values for nLocation are:

Value   Constant         Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
- 1    TOOL_NOTDOCKED   Undocks the Toolbar.
  0    TOOL_TOP         Docks the toolbar at the top of the main Visual
                        FoxPro window.
  1    TOOL_LEFT        Docks the toolbar at the left side of the main
                        Visual FoxPro window.
  2    TOOL_RIGHT       Docks the toolbar at the right side of the main
                        Visual FoxPro window.
  3    TOOL_BOTTOM      Docks the toolbar at the bottom of the main Visual
                        FoxPro window.
X, Y                     Specifies the horizontal and vertical coordinates
                        of the docked position of the toolbar.

When a toolbar is docked, its title bar is hidden and its border is changed to a
single line. The toolbar is also resized to a single row of buttons. The window
is resized so that the toolbar does not obscure any information on the screen.

For example, if the toolbar is docked at the top, the screen is moved down by the
height of the toolbar. Use the Move method to undock a toolbar. When using the
Move method, specify coordinates that lie outside the dock area.
