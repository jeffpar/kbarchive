The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In an environment that relies on Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) to resolve
NetBIOS names, the error message "There are no logon servers available to
service the logon request" appears if you are an administrator and you do one or
more of the following:

- You attempt to remotely administer a trusted domain. For example, you use
  File Manager to assign share permissions to users from the trusted domain.

- You attempt to select the trusted domain in User Manager for Domains.

CAUSE
=====

The WINS database does not have the proper domain registrations for pass-
through authentication. See the more information section below for more
details.

This problem occurs most often in environments where the administrator has
created a two-way trust between two previously independent domains. Most often,
there are WINS servers in each domain and the WINS servers do not replicate
their databases to each other.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

- Allow WINS dynamic registration.

  This ensures that Domain Controllers register their DOMAIN&lt;1C&gt; NetBIOS
  names with the WINS Server.

- Make certain that WINS database replication is successful between WINS
  Servers. Missing database entries for domain names may indicate Problems with
  the WINS Servers and replication.

To work around this problem:

  NOTE: Microsoft does not recommend using static mappings in the WINS database
  for WINS enabled computers.

1. Run the WINS Administration Utility to add static mappings for the
  Domain&lt;1C&gt; registrations (of the trusted domain) that are not listed in
  the WINS database:

     Name:        Master DOMAIN Name
     IP Address:  Address of the Primary Domain Controller (PDC) of the
                   domain
     Type:        Domain Name
 

If you are logged on as an administrator at a Domain Controller, remote
administration works now successfully. If you are attempting to remotely
administer the domain while logged on to a Server (not a domain controller) or
Windows NT Workstation, you must add DOMAIN&lt;1C&gt; entries for both the
trusted and trusting domains.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To remotely administer a trusted domain, several pass-through authentication
steps must take place. If the WINS database does not have the proper domain
registrations, the pass-through authentication fails.

For example, a trust is established between DOMAIN_A and DOMAIN_B. Server PDC_A
is in DOMAIN_A and PDC_B is in DOMAIN_B. DOMAIN_A is the trusted (master)
domain, and DOMAIN_B is the resource (trusting) domain. To establish this trust
relationship, the following NetBIOS names must be resolved to IP addresses,
either through WINS or broadcast:

  NetBIOS Name      Description of Use of Name
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  DOMAIN_A&lt;1B&gt;      PDC_B uses this to query the PDC of DOMAIN_A
  PDC_A&lt;00&gt;         PDC_B uses this to set up a session with the PDC of
                    DOMAIN_A
  DOMAIN_A&lt;1C&gt;      PDC_B uses this to get DC list of DOMAIN_A

With these three names being registered, and if your account has administrator
priviledges, the trust can be established and the message "The trust
relationship was established successfully" appears. When you reboot the
computer, or the first time you attempt remote administration, another NetBIOS
name is needed:

  NetBIOS Name   Description of Use of Name
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
  DOMAIN_A&lt;1C&gt;   Each Domain Controller in DOMAIN_B uses this name to
                 establish a secure channel with a Domain Controller in
                 the trusted domain.

The Domain Controller (DC) in the trusting domain attempts to create a secure
channel with any DC in the trusted domain by making a multicast logon request to
the NetBIOS name DOMAIN_A&lt;1C&gt;. This logon request is part of a process
that creates a Secure Channel between the two DCs. The logon ID in this logon
request is the inter-domain trust account for the trusting domain, DOMAIN_B$. If
there is no registration for DOMAIN_A&lt;1C&gt; in the WINS database the error
message STATUS_NO_LOGON_SERVERS is returned to the call. The message "There are
currently no logon servers available" is then returned to the user.
