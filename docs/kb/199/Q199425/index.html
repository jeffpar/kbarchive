-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install Exchange Server 5.5 on an existing site where the
Microsoft Exchange Connector for IBM OfficeVision/VM (PROFS) is located, setup
may not work and you may receive the following error message:

  E-mail address for address type ' PROFS ' were not generated because an error
  occurred. To view details of the error, see the application event log in the
  Windows NT Event Viewer on the Microsoft Exchange Server computer.

  E-mail address for address type ' NOTES ' were not generated because an error
  occurred. To view details of the error, see the application event log in the
  Windows NT Event Viewer on the Microsoft Exchange Server computer.

  E-mail address for address type ' CCMAIL ' were not generated because an error
  occurred. To view details of the error, see the application event log in the
  Windows NT Event Viewer on the Microsoft Exchange Server computer.

  E-mail address for address type ' MS ' were not generated because an error
  occurred. To view details of the error, see the application event log in the
  Windows NT Event Viewer on the Microsoft Exchange Server computer.

CAUSE
=====

When you install additional connectors in an Exchange environment, an address
generator is installed. This address generator facilitates the automatic
generation of proxy addresses to use when the server sends and receives mail
between a foreign system and the Exchange Server computer. The address generator
is composed of a directory object and a .dll file that is located in the
Addressing folder.

In this case, either the attributes of the directory object or the .dll file are
incorrectly configured or unavailable. Because system accounts are generated
during setup, the address generator must be available.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Remove all files and services that were created during the installation
  procedure that did not work, and then restart the server.

2. In the Exchange Administration program, connect to a server in the site that
  you want to join.

3. Click the Configuration container, click the Site Addressing object, and get
  the properties.

4. On the Site Addressing tab, click to clear the address type that is listed in
  the error message. For example, if the error message lists the address type
  'PROFS', click to clear the proxy address generator for PROFS, and then click
  Apply.

5. Run Exchange Server setup.

6. After setup is finished, click to select the PROFS check box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft recommends that you follow the procedures in this article only after
you have confirmed that no new mailboxes will be created during setup. If new
mailboxes are created during setup, they will not include the e-mail address
type that you disabled.

The procedures in this article also work around this problem when it occurs with
other third-party proxy address types.

This problem has been noted in several Exchange Server environments, but it has
not proven to be an issue with all environments that use third-party site
addresses.
