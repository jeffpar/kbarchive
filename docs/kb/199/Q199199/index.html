-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Systems Management Server 2.0, the name of a program cannot be changed or
modified in any way after it has been created. The database structure currently
does not allow this modification.

CAUSE
=====

The program name is a database key; thus the name is used to identify a
package's program in advertisements. If the key were changed, it would orphan
any advertisements that rely on the key to identify the program.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you must change the name of a program, you must delete and re-create it with
the same settings it originally had (except for the name). The advertisements,
which are deleted with the program, as well as the security, must also be
re-created, as with the creation of any new program.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using the Systems Management Server Software ToolKit (STK) to override this
limitation is strongly discouraged because it will most likely yield an error
with WMI PutInstance. At this time, it is not known what other side effects
modifying this parameter might have on the database and the Systems Management
Server site server itself. Making this change by means of the STK is likely to
have detrimental effects on, but not limited to, the STK itself, future upgrade
possibilities, some server subsystems, the database, and some client
components.

Note that you can change the names of packages, collections, and advertisements
in Systems Management Server 2.0.
