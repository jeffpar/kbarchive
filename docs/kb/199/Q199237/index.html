SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the procedure on how to prevent Systems Management Server
1.2 clients from being upgraded by Systems Management 2.0 sites that they visit.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a Systems Management Server 1.2 client visits a Systems Management Server
2.0 site, you must prevent the Systems Management Server 2.0 site from claiming
the client and replacing the Systems Management Server 1.2 client software with
Systems Management Server 2.0 client software. Use the following procedure to
prevent Systems Management Server 1.2 clients from being automatically upgraded
by Systems Management Server 2.0 sites they visit:

1. Create a file in the root directory (c:\) of the visiting computer. The file
  name, the file type, and the content of the file are not important, although
  you should document the use of the file within the file itself. For example,
  you might create a file called KeepIt12.txt with the following content:

     The presence of this file prevents Systems Management Server 1.2
     client software from being overwritten with Systems Management 
     Server 2.0 software, provided that the logon script at the Systems 
     Management Server 2.0 site has been modified to look for this file 
     and exit if it is found, and also provided that client setup methods 
     other than Windows NT Logon have not been enabled at that site.

2. Distribute the file (in this example, KeepIt12.txt) to the Systems Management
  Server 1.2 client computers that are likely to visit the Systems Management
  Server 2.0 sites.

3. At each of these Systems Management Server 2.0 sites, go to the
  Winnt\System32\Repl\Import\Scripts directory of the logon servers and edit
  the Smsls.bat file so that it detects the file you created and exits if that
  file is found. For example, add the following line to the Smsls.bat file:

     if exist c:\KeepIt12.txt goto end

4. If you expect the visiting computers to be running Windows NT, make sure the
  Windows NT Remote Client Installation method is disabled. (This method is a
  site configuration setting, which you can find under Client Installation
  Methods in the Systems Management Server Administrator console.)
