The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the methods which are available in Windows NT to identify
which workstation was used by a user to log on to the network. You can use one
or more of the following methods:

- Method 1: Using Windows NT Auditing.

-or-

- Method 2: Using Microsoft Network Monitor (or other network tracing utility)

-or-

- Method 3: Using Windows NT Diagnostics (NT 4.0)

MORE INFORMATION
================

Method 1: Using Windows NT Auditing
-----------------------------------

To use Windows NT auditing to determine which workstation a user accessed to
logon to the domain, follow these steps:

1. Start "User Manager for Domains".

2. Click Audit from the Policies menu.

3. Click to enable Success for the "Logon and Logoff" category. Optionally, you
  may also check the Failure box.

After the above procedure has been implemented, Windows NT will create an event
log for each successful logon attempt. The log will appear like the following
example:

  Event Detail
  Date:     06/04/98  Event ID:  528
  Time:     10:06:43 AM  Source:  Security
  User:     msolanki  Type:  Success Audit
  Computer: SMSCENT  Category: Logon/Logoff

  Description:
  Logon/Logoff: Successful
  Logon User Name: msolanki
  Domain: SATHYA
  Logon ID: (0x0, 0x2D0D0)
  Logon Type: 3
  Logon Process: User32 Authentication Pkg:
  MICROSOFT_AUTHENTICATION_PACKAGE_V1_0
  Workstation Name: \\JAMES

Method 2: Using Network Monitor
-------------------------------

To use Network Monitor to determine which workstation a user accessed to log on
to the domain, follow these steps:

1. Capture all incoming traffic to the domain controller(s). In order to reduce
  the size of the captured data, follow these steps:

  a. If possible, include only the primary domain controller or backup domain
     controller that is most likely to validate the user.

  b. Set a capture filter, including only the server message block (SMB)
     protocol.

  c. Configure a large enough memory buffer through the Buffer Settings option
     on the Capture menu.

2. After the data has been captured, set a display filter to only include:

  Protocol: SMB
  Property: Account Name
  Relation: Exists

This will display all the initial SMB session setup containing the user name and
the source media access control address.

For example:

Src Mac Addr: Dst Mac Addr: Description
WKS1          SUNKING       C session setup &amp; X, Username = MariaH, and C
tree connect &amp; X, Share = \\SUNKING\IPC$
WKS2          SUNKING       C session setup &amp; X, Username = JoeSmith, and C
tree connect &amp; X, Share = \\SUNKING\IPC$
WKS3          SUNKING       C session setup &amp; X, Username = Administrator,
and C tree connect &amp; X, Share = \\SUNKING\IPC$

In the example above, WKS1 is the computer where the user is logging on from,
SUNKING is the domain controller authenticating the request, and the Description
contains the Windows NT domain account being used.

NOTE: The Src Mac Addr may also been shown as a media access control or IP
address if the NetBIOS name could not be resolved or the entry is not in the
Network Monitor address database.

Method 3: Using Windows NT Diagnostics
--------------------------------------

To use Windows NT diagnostics to determine which workstation a user accessed to
log on to the domain, follow these steps:

1. At the client workstation, click Start, type "Winmsd" (without the quotation
  marks) in the Open box, and then click OK.

2. On the Network tab, click the General button.

  You will see information similar to the following:

Identifier            Value

Your Access level     Admin; Local
Workgroup or Domain   SATHYA
Network version       4.0
Lan Root              SATHYA
Logged On Users         1
Current User (1)      MSolanki
Logged Domain         SATHYA
Logon Server          SMSCENT
