IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start your computer, you may receive the following error message:

  At least one service or driver failed during system startup. Use Event
  Viewer to examine the event log for details.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the NetBios data value is missing from the registry.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this behavior, use Registry Editor to add the "NetBios" (without the
quotation marks) data value to the DependOnService multi-string value in the
following registry key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Messenger

The DependOnService multi-string value should include the LanmanWorkstation and
NetBios data values.

NOTE: The DependOnService multi-string value is displayed as a hexadecimal number
when you use Regedit.exe, and as a REG_MULTI_SZ value when you use Regedt32.exe.
Therefore, you should use Regedt32.exe to add the NetBios data value.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you check the Services tool in Control Panel, you may find that the
Messenger service is started and networking is functional. However, Event Viewer
may display the following error message:

  Event ID 7022 Source: Service Control Manager
  Description: The Messenger Service hung on startup
