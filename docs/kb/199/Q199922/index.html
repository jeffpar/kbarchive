IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to disable the Remote Control Security Munger on
computers running Windows NT that have been added as Systems Management Server
clients. You can add a value to the client's registry that enables you to
disable the Security Munger.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

The Remote Control Security Munger determines the remote control security
settings for a Systems Management Server client that belongs to more than one
Systems Management Server site. In some situations, you might want to disable
this feature on a computer running Windows NT.

To disable the Security Munger, add the following value to the Systems Management
Server client's registry:

  HKLM/Software/Microsoft/SMS/Client/Client Components/Remote Control

  Value: "UpdateEnabled" Type: REG_SZ Data: "NO" (this is not case sensitive)

If this value is set to "NO", the Security Munger will exit without doing
anything but will make an entry in the Remctrl.log noting that it was disabled.
Note that as a result, the client will no longer respond to any changes in the
administrator or client user interface. If this is the case, the user or
administrator will have to alter the client registry to make any changes. If
this registry entry is not present or the value is anything other than "NO", the
Security Munger will operate as normal.

The UpdateEnabled value is removed when the Remote Control component is
uninstalled from the client, but not during Component Verify or Repair cycles or
reinstallation of the client component.

For systems that are locked down, the combined sites registry entry and the
Remote Control registry entries must match. If they do not, the combined site
entries take precedence over the Remote Control entries. This issue does not
occur if you use the Remote Control tool in Control Panel to make the change.
This information applies to the following registry key:

  HKLM/Software/Microsoft/SMS/Client/Client Components/Remote Control/Combined
  Site
