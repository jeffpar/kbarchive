The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Systems Management Server 2.0, the Standard Sender takes the place of the LAN
Sender from Systems Management Server 1.2. Standard Sender, as it is now called,
is used for connecting sites across high-speed links such as 10BaseT LAN lines.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Each time the Standard Sender in Systems Management Server 2.0 sends a buffer of
the package to the remote site, it recomputes the delay factor and indicates in
the log file how long it will delay before sending the next buffer. In this way,
the total average usage of the link will be controlled, even though while
sending a single buffer of the package the Standard Sender will use the full
bandwidth of the connection.

In Systems Management Server 2.0, all you configure is the Number of Retries, the
Delay before retrying (Min.), and the Maximum concurrent sendings to All Sites
and Per Site. There is no longer a need to specify the maximum amount of
bandwidth that the Standard Sender will be allowed to use.

In Systems Management Server 1.2, the administrator specified how much bandwidth
the connection consisted of. An administrator configuring the bandwidth of the
Standard Sender in Systems Management Server 2.0 does not have to do this
because the Standard Sender calculates the instantaneous available rate
continuously. The bandwidth control in Systems Management Server 2.0 is based
only on the address rather than a mixture of the address and the sender (as it
was in Systems Management Server 1.2).
