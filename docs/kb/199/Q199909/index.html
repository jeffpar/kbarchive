  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

After applying Service Pack 4 to a Windows NT 4.0 DNS Server, the server will
appear to stop resolving queries for hosts in certain remote domains. The first
query for a host in one of these domains will succeed, but subsequent queries
for other hosts in the same domain will fail.

CAUSE
=====

The DNS code in Service Pack 4 was updated to support Ranking Data as defined in
RFC 2181 section 5.4.1. After an answer from an authoritative NS has been
cached, Windows NT DNS discontinues querying referrals to non-authoritative NSs.
The authoritative NS is cached. If the authority does not have an associated
glue record for the additional NSs, DNS will not be able to resolve the HOST RR
for the other NSs, thus causing subsequent queries to fail.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do the following:

- Contact an administrator of the remote domain to verify that the name server
  in question has associated glue records for all authoritative NSs.

- To change the behavior of the DNS server, acquire the latest DNS hotfix from
  Microsoft Product Support Services.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
the individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
pack, please go to:

- http://www.microsoft.com/Windows/ServicePacks/

For information on obtaining the individual software update, contact Microsoft
Product Support Services. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support
Services phone numbers and information on support costs, please go to the
following address on the World Wide Web:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0 SP4. This
problem was first corrected in Windows NT version 4.0 Service Pack 5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After the hotfix has been acquired, add the following value to the registry:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\system\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters

  Value Name: NoCacheRanking
  Data Type: REG_DWORD
  Value: 1
