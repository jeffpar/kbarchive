SYMPTOMS
========

During directory replication the following events may be logged in the
application event log:

  Event ID 1188
  Source: MSExchange DS
  Type: Information
  Category: Replication
  Description:
  Internal event: The directory replication agent (DRA) received exception 1727
  from a remote procedure call (RPC) connection to server SERVER1.

  Event ID 1083
  Source: MSExchangeDS
  Type: Warning
  Category: Replication
  Description:
  Replication warning: The directory replication agent (DRA) couldn't
  synchronize naming context /o=Org/ou=Site with naming context on directory
  SERVER1.

  Event ID 1059
  Source: MSExchangeDS
  Type: Warning
  Category: Replication
  Description:
  Internal error: The directory replication agent (DRA) call returned error 13.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange Server computer cannot resolve the name of the server to which it
is replicating by means of TCP/IP.

RESOLUTION
==========

Troubleshoot and resolve the name resolution issue.

WORKAROUND
==========

As a temporary workaround, you can add an entry to the Hosts or Lmhosts file on
the server; this entry points to the Exchange Server computer that you want the
server to replicate to.

To add an Exchange Server computer entry to a Hosts file:

1. Start a text editor, for example, Notepad.

2. Open the Hosts file from the Winnt\System32\Drivers\Etc directory.

3. To add an entry in the Hosts file, at the bottom of the file, type the IP
  address and computer name of the destination server, for example:

  1.1.1.1 SERVER1

4. Save the Hosts file without an extension, and then quit Notepad.

The Hosts file is read every time a Winsock application resolves a host name.
There are NO #PRE options to preload entries (which is how it is done in the
Lmhosts file). You can add the Exchange Server computer entry to the Hosts file
and start directory replication again without restarting Windows.

NOTE: If you are using the Lmhosts file instead of the Hosts file, it is also
located in the Winnt\System32\Drivers\Etc directory.
