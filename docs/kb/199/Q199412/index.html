The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program has built-in functionality
that allows you to quickly dump an object's raw properties to a text file that
can be sent to a Microsoft Support Professional. This can be very useful when
you are troubleshooting objects with many configuration options, such as an
X.400 connector, where there may be typographical errors, basic configuration
errors, or misunderstandings that are difficult for a Microsoft Support
Professional to catch over the phone.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Administrator dump files are always written to a file named Admindmp.txt. If the
file does not already exist, it is created. If it already exists, the current
dump is appended to the existing file.

The dump file is created in the Administrator program's working directory.
Normally, this is the Exchsrvr\Bin directory, but it may be different if the
Administrator is started from the command line in a different directory, or if
the working directory of the Administrator icon has been modified.

It is usually much easier to work with distinct dump files for each object of
interest, so you should rename the Admindmp.txt file after each object's raw
properties are dumped.

Notepad does not easily read the dump file format, so you may want to rename your
dump files with a .wri extension instead of .txt. For example, if you perform
dumps on two objects and rename the Admindmp.txt file after each dump, you might
end up with two files named Tcpstack.wri and X400conn.wri.

Steps to Create an Admindmp.txt File
------------------------------------

1. Verify that there is not an existing Admindmp.txt file. If so, rename or
  delete it.

WARNING: Using the raw mode of the Exchange Server Administrator program (admin
/r) incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall
Microsoft Windows NT Server and/or Microsoft Exchange Server. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of raw mode can be
solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.

2. Start the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program in raw mode by
  typing the following at a command prompt:

  c:\exchsrvr\bin\admin /r

3. Select the object from which you will dump the raw properties.

4. Press and hold down the CTRL key.

5. On the File menu, click Raw Properties.

6. Continue to hold the CTRL key down until the Raw Properties page is
  displayed, then you can release it.

7. Click the Cancel button on the Raw Properties page.

8. Rename the newly created Admindmp.txt file to something meaningful.

9. Perform any more Administrator dumps you need (repeat steps 3 through 8 for
  each dump.)

10. Quit the Exchange Server Administrator program.

Breakdown of X.400 Connector Administrator Dump File
----------------------------------------------------

You may not see all of the following properties reported in your own dump files
as what is listed below contains samples from TCP, TP4, and X.25 stacks. In
addition, some properties are only reported if they aren't blank. If the
property is left blank, nothing is reported in the Administrator dump file.

NOTE: Comments explaining or amplifying properties or values will be enclosed in
square ([]) brackets.
