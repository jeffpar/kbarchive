SUMMARY
=======

This articles describes the three methods to upgrade a Systems Management Server
secondary site from Systems Management Server 1.2 to version 2.0 after the
primary site server has been upgraded to 2.0

MORE INFORMATION
================

Options for Upgrading a Systems Management Server Secondary Site
----------------------------------------------------------------

- Download the upgrade from the parent site.

  Select this option when the secondary site does not have an administrator who
  can perform the upgrade and when the impact on inter-site bandwidth is not a
  concern. Each site upgrade involves the transmission of approximately 65 MB
  of data. Concurrent secondary site upgrades should be limited to less than
  the "maximum concurrent sendings" for "all sites," as set in Systems
  Management Server Sender Manager.

- Initiate the upgrade from the parent site using source files located at the
  secondary site.

  Select this option when you want to control the upgrade from the primary site
  but want to minimize the impact on inter-site bandwidth.

- Upgrade locally at the secondary site server using the Systems Management
  Server installation CD-ROM.

  Select this option when the secondary site has an administrator who can
  perform the upgrade or when the impact on inter-site bandwidth is a concern.

If you plan to initiate the upgrade from the parent site but complete the
installation at the secondary site, make sure the source files are at the
secondary site. Someone at the secondary site must insert the Systems Management
Server 2.0 CD-ROM into a drive that is accessible from the secondary site
server. Alternatively, you can copy all of the files (both i386 and Alpha, even
if you are using only one of these platforms) to a network drive at the
secondary site before you begin the upgrade.

NOTE: As soon as you have run the Secondary Site Upgrade Wizard at the primary
site, the secondary site's properties appear in the details pane when its parent
site is selected in the console tree. However, the secondary site's properties
do not appear under the parent site in the console tree until the primary site
receives the site control file from the upgraded secondary site. This can take
up to 24 hours.
