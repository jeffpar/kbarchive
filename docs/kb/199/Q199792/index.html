SUMMARY
=======

This article describes DNS event IDs 2000 through 9999 for Windows NT Server
version 4.0 with Service Pack 4 installed. In the list below, each event ID
number is followed by its definition and description.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Admin / RPC
-----------

Messages generated as a result of admin activity.

Boot File Backup Message
------------------------

  2000 (Success) DNS_BOOTFILE_BACKUP_MESSAGE
  The DNS Server is now booting from the registry. The existing boot file will
  no longer be read on startup. New zones or changes to zone information must
  now be made through the DNS manager. The previous boot file has been moved to
  the %SystemRoot%\system32\dns\backup directory.

  To return to using a boot file, use the registry editor to open
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters and
  delete the value EnableRegistryBoot. Then replace your desired boot file in
  the system32\dns directory. Note, however, that ALL changes to zone
  information, including new zones, made through the DNS Manager will be
  wriiten back to the boot file if it maps to a supported boot file directive.

  Q129047 Synchronizing DNS Information in Registry with Boot Files

  2001 (Success) DNS_EVENT_BOOTFILE_REWRITE
  The DNS Server has written a new version of the boot file. New zones or
  changes to zone information made through the DNS Manager, require The DNS
  Server to change the information in the boot file.
  The previous boot file has been moved to the %SystemRoot%\system32\dns\backup
  directory file "boot.last".

  2002 (Error) DNS_EVENT_BOOTFILE_WRITE_ERROR
  The DNS Server encountered an error writing current configuration back to boot
  file. Verify that current boot file contains all desired information.

  2003 (Success) DNS_EVENT_SWITCH_TO_BOOTFILE
  The DNS Server has been reconfigured to boot from a boot file. Current server
  and zone configuration information has been written to the boot file.

  To return to using registry boot use the registry editor to open
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS\Parameters and set
  the value EnableRegistryBoot to 1.

  and restart. The DNS Server will transfer the new version and rewrite its
  zone file.

  failed to complete transfer of zone. Check DNS server at %2 and insure it is
  properly functioning and authoritative for zone %1.

Winsock Run-Time Errors
-----------------------

  7050 (Error) DNS_EVENT_RECV_CALL_FAILED
  DNS Server recv() function failed. The data is the error.

  7051 (Error) DNS_EVENT_RECVFROM_CALL_FAILED
  DNS Server recvfrom() function failed. The data is the error.

  7052 (Error) DNS_EVENT_SEND_CALL_FAILED
  DNS Server send() function failed. The data is the error.

  7053 (Error) DNS_EVENT_SENDTO_CALL_FAILED
  DNS Server sendto() function failed. The data is the error.

  7054 (Error) DNS_EVENT_SELECT_CALL_FAILED
  DNS Server select() function failed. The data is the error.

  7055 (Error) DNS_EVENT_ACCEPT_CALL_FAILED
  DNS Server accept() function failed. The data is the error.

  7056 (Error) DNS_EVENT_GQCS_CALL_FAILED
  DNS Server GetQueuedCompletionStatus() function failed. The data is the error.

  7060 (Warning) DNS_EVENT_CANNOT_CONNECT_TO_SERVER
  DNS Server could not connect to DNS server at %1.

  7061 (Error) DNS_EVENT_CANNOT_SET_WINS_BROADCAST
  DNS Server could not set broadcast option on WINS socket. The data is the
  error.

  7062 (Error) DNS_EVENT_SELF_SEND
  DNS Server encountered a packet addressed to itself -- IP address %1. The DNS
  Server should never be sending a packet to itself. This situation usually
  indicates a configuration error. Check the following areas for possible
  self-send configuration errors:

    1) Forwarders list. (DNS servers should not forward to themselves).
    2) Master lists of secondary zones.
    3) Notify lists of primary zones.
    4) Delegations of subzones. Must not contain NS record for DNS server.

  Example:

  -&gt; This DNS server dns1.mycompany.com is the primary for the zone
  mycompany.com.
  -&gt; You have delegated the zone sales.mycompany.com to
  salesdns.sales.mycompany.com. and are NOT running the sales.mycompany.com
  zone on this DNS (dns1.mycompany.com).
  -&gt; sales.mycompany.com MUST NOT have an NS record that points at
  dns1.mycompany.com.

  Note, you should make this check (with nslookup or DNS manager) both on this
  DNS server and on the server(s) you delegated the subzone to. It is possible
  that the delegation was done correctly, but that the primary DNS for the
  subzone, has any incorrect NS record pointing back at this server. If this
  incorrect NS record is cached at this server, then the self-send could
  result. If found, the subzone DNS server admin should remove the offending NS
  record.

General Run-Time Errors
-----------------------

  7500 (Error) DNS_EVENT_SERVER_FAILURE_PROCESSING_PACKET
  DNS Server failure processing packet from %1. Packet is discarded.

  7501 (Error) DNS_EVENT_WAIT_CALL_FAILED
  DNS Server call to WaitForMultipleObjects() failed. The data is the error.

  7502 (Error) DNS_EVENT_OUT_OF_MEMORY
  DNS Server was unable to service a client request due a shortage of available
  memory.

  7503 (Error) DNS_EVENT_CANNOT_ALLOCATE_RECORD
  DNS Server could not allocate memory for resource record %1.

  7504 (Error) DNS_EVENT_CANNOT_ALLOCATE_NODE
  DNS Server could not allocate memory for node for domain name %1.


End of Run-Time Message Suppression
-----------------------------------

  9999 (Warning) DNS_EVENT_CONTINUE_LOG_SUPPRESS
  DNS Server has encounters numerous run-time events. These are usually caused
  by the reception of bad or unexpected packets, or from problems with or
  excessive replication traffic. The data is the number of suppressed events
  encountered in the last 15 minute interval.
