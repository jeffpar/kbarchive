-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3, 5.5 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Inbound Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) messages may contain an extra blank
line after a carriage-return/line-feed combination in the message body. This
problem can occur if the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) header
content-type has a value of text/enriched and if there are Hypertext Markup
Language (HTML) tags in the message body. This problem occurs only when you view
the message with Microsoft Outlook 2000, not when you view the message with any
earlier version of Outlook.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the text/enriched content-type causes the message to
go through a Rich Text Format (RTF) parser. The RTF parser adds a new paragraph
symbol at the end of a line, and also retains the end of one combination of
carriage-return/line-feed. This problem is usually resolved later, but in this
scenario, it is not.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Information store

+-------------------------+
| File name | Version     | 
+-------------------------+
| Store.exe | 5.5.2654.56 | 
+-------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, this fix requires Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 4.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
