-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using compiled components with events, and the event is triggered from a
modal form inside the component, the event is not received by the client
application when it is run from the Visual Basic Design Environment (IDE). This
problem does not occur when both components have been compiled.

RESOLUTION
==========

Display the form that triggers the event non-modally to avoid the problem when
testing the application in the IDE.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Visual Basic ActiveX DLL project. Class1 is created by default.

2. On the Project menu, click Project1 Properties. In the Project Properties
  dialog box, set the Project Name field to MyEventsDll. Click OK.

3. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Class1:

  Option Explicit

  Public Event DoSomething()

  Public Sub FireEvent()
      RaiseEvent DoSomething
  End Sub

  Public Sub ShowForm(ByVal ShowType As Long)
     Form1.SetEventObject Me
     If ShowType = vbModeless Then
        Form1.Caption = "Non-Modal"
        Form1.Show
     Else
        Form1.Caption = "Modal"
        Form1.Show vbModal
     End If
  End Sub

4. On the Project menu, click Add Form to add a new form to the project. Form1
  is created by default.

5. Add a CommandButton to Form1.

6. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Form1:

  Option Explicit

  Dim EventObject As Class1

  Public Sub SetEventObject(objNew As Class1)
     Set EventObject = objNew
  End Sub

  Private Sub Command1_Click()
     EventObject.FireEvent
  End Sub

  Private Sub Form_Load()
     Command1.Caption = "Fire Event"
  End Sub

7. Save the project and compile it.

8. On the File menu, click New Project. Create a new Visual Basic Standard EXE
  project. Form1 is created by default.

9. Change the name of Form1 to frmTest.

10. On the Project menu, click References. Add a reference by checking
  MyEventsDll and clicking OK.

11. Add two CommandButtons to frmTest.

12. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of frmTest:

  Option Explicit

  Dim WithEvents MyObj As MyEventsDll.Class1

  Private Sub Command1_Click()
     MyObj.ShowForm vbModal ' Show Form Modal
  End Sub

  Private Sub Command2_Click()
     MyObj.ShowForm vbModeless ' Show Form Non-Modal
  End Sub

  Private Sub Form_Load()
     Set MyObj = New MyEventsDll.Class1
     Command1.Caption = "Show Form Modal"
     Command2.Caption = "Show Form Non-Modal"
  End Sub

  Private Sub MyObj_DoSomething()
     MsgBox "Received event from DLL"
  End Sub

13. Save the project.

14. Press the F5 key to run the project in the IDE.

15. Click the Show Form Non-Modal button to display the form from the DLL as
  non-modal. Click the Fire Event button. A message box displaying the text
  "Received event from DLL" should be displayed, confirming that the event
  fired from inside the DLL reached the client application.

16. Close the non-modal form.

17. Click the Show Form Modal button to display the form from the DLL as modal.
  Click the Fire Event button and observe that the message box is not
  displayed. This demonstrates that the event that was fired from the modal
  form was not received by the client.

18. On the Project menu, click Make Project1.exe to compile the client.

19. Run Project1.exe and repeat the steps above. The message box should display
  whether the form in the DLL is shown modally or non-modally.
