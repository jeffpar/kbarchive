-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use Performance Monitor to track Private Bytes and Virtual Bytes on a
Terminal Services-based server, the Spoolss.exe service may show increased
memory usage, and may use from roughly 75 percent to 100 percent of the
processor power.

CAUSE
=====

This issue may occur if Citrix Metaframe Independent Computing Architecture
(ICA) clients connect to your Terminal Services-based server. If you run Citrix
with an ICA client in a Terminal Services environment, printers such as a
Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 895cxi are automatically created. This causes the
symptoms that are described earlier in this article to occur.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, use either of the following methods.

Use an Earlier Driver from the Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, CD-ROM
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Create a local printer, install a Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 550 driver from the
  Base Windows NT Terminal Server Edition CD-ROM, and then delete the printer.
  The driver remains installed on the computer.

2. Modify the Wtsuprn.txt file, and then rename it with an .inf file name
  extension.

Turn Off the Ability for Users to Automatically Create Printers If the Driver Is Not Installed
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Use Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) to view the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Providers\LanManPrintServices\Servers

2. Add the following registry value:

  Value name: AddPrinterDrivers
  Value type: REG_DWORD
  Value data: 1

  Using Metaframe ICA Client

MORE INFORMATION
