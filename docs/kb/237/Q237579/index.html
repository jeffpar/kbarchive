SYMPTOMS
========

To connect to a computer across subnets in a multiple-subnet environment with a
remote Performance Monitor Session, you must use either the Fully Qualified
Domain Name (FQDN), or the Internet Protocol (IP) address. After you connect,
you can view data in real-time. However, when you try to capture data to a log,
even though the NetBIOS name is resolved and the log grows in size, all objects
and counters are lost.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because Performance Monitor is dependent on NetBIOS name
resolution when logging data.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, use any of the following methods:

Method 1
--------

1. Place an Lmhosts file containing the computer name and IP address of the
  target computer in the %systemroot%\drivers\etc folder of the monitoring
  workstation. View the Lmhosts.sam file for information about how to do so.

2. Configure TCP/IP to perform a LMHOSTS lookup. For information about how to do
  so, please click the article number below to view the article in the
  Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q192064 Using LMHOSTS Lookup to Create Multiple Preferred Login Servers

Method 2
--------

Enable DNS for Windows Resolution:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
  Network.

2. Click the Protocols tab, double-click TCP/IP, and then click to select the
  "Enable DNS for WINS Resolution" check box. Note that a DNS server must also
  be defined in TCP/IP Properties.

Method 3
--------

Point computer monitoring to a WINS server on the network that has the target
computer defined:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
  Network.

2. Click the Protocols tab, double-click TCP/IP, click the Wins Address tab,
  enter the appropriate IP addresses of the primary and secondary (if
  applicable) WINS servers, and then click OK.

NOTE: Because the computer performing the data logging is the only one that needs
NetBIOS resolution, the quickest way to get the Performance Monitor working is
to create an Lmhosts file on that machine. This is not an optimal solution for
WINS resolution on a large network because these files would have to be on
multiple servers and workstations. Also, IP addressing changes would require
modification on all computers that have an Lmhosts file.
