-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2) client for Windows NT always installs
the Microsoft Management Console (MMC). MMC is installed even if the SNA Server
Manager component is not selected for installation during the setup or update
process.

This occurs when you use Setup.exe to do a new installation of the client or when
you use Update.exe to update an existing SNA Server 4.0 or 4.0 SP1 Windows NT
client.

CAUSE
=====

The Setup.exe and Update.exe programs for the SNA Server 4.0 SP2 client for
Windows NT are designed to always install MMC.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
4.0. For additional information, click the following article number to view the
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
SNA Server version 4.0 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The setup and update processes have been modified so that MMC is not installed
on a Windows NT client unless MMC-dependent options (such as, SNA Server
Manager, COMTI) are selected for installation during the setup or update
process.

The following steps need to be followed if you want to install the SP2 client
without installing MMC:

1. Copy the SNA Server 4.0 SP2 version of the Windows NT client from the SNA
  Server 4.0 SP2 Retail or Update CD to a directory on a hard drive such that
  the following directory structure exists on the hard drive:

   - &lt;root&gt;

   - &lt;root&gt;\Mdac\....

   - &lt;root&gt;\Reg2udl\....

   - &lt;root&gt;\Clients\Winnt\I386

  The SNA Server 4.0 SP2 update version of the Windows NT client is also
  available for download at the following location:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/sna-public/fixes/sna40/ussp2/40sp2ic.exe

  This image can be extracted to a specific directory using the following
  command:

  40SP2IC -x

  NOTE: The files from the root directory of the SNA Server 4.0 SP2 CD are
  needed, which is why &lt;root&gt; is listed as part of the necessary
  directory structure. The downloaded version of the client also includes these
  files.

2. Replace the existing Snafile.stf in the Clients\Winnt\I386 directory with the
  updated version of Snafile.stf.

3. Run Setup.exe to install the client or Update.exe to update an existing
  client.

Windows NT 4.0 SP2 clients, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
