- Microsoft ODBC Driver for Access, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) versions 2.1 and 2.5 both install a
major new version of the Microsoft Access ODBC driver. This Access ODBC driver
uses the Microsoft Jet 4.0 database engine, which allows access to Access 2000
format databases as well as to all previous Access database formats. The version
of the Access ODBC driver that ships with MDAC version 1.5 and 2.0 uses the
Microsoft Jet 3.5 database engine to manipulate the Access database file.

Due to design changes in Jet 4.0, as well as issues with backward compatibility,
the new Access ODBC driver can break existing, installed ODBC applications that
use the Access ODBC driver, in some cases forcing the developer to recode the
application.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Overview of MDAC 2.1 and MDAC 2.5 Access ODBC Driver Issues
-----------------------------------------------------------

The Jet 4.0-based Microsoft Access ODBC driver uses the same file name as the
older Jet 3.5-based driver, namely Odbcjt32.dll. When you install MDAC 2.1 or
2.5, the Jet 3.5-using Odbcjt32.dll file is overwritten by a Jet 4.0-using
Odbcjt32.dll ODBC driver Dll. Thus, existing installed applications that use the
Microsoft Access ODBC driver that shipped with MDAC 2.0 or MDAC 1.5 are
converted to the newer driver if MDAC 2.1 or MDAC 2.5 is installed on the
computer.

Odbcjt32.dll is the core Microsoft Access ODBC driver DLL. This DLL exports all
of the ODBC API functions used by an ODBC client application. When you use
Odbcjt32.dll from ODBC, it loads and uses either Msjet35.dll or Msjet40.dll (Jet
3.5 or Jet 4.0) to manipulate the Access database. Note that if you install MDAC
2.0 and then install MDAC 2.1 or MDAC 2.5 on the same computer, you have two
parallel functioning versions of Jet installed on the computer because all of
the Jet engine files have unique file names between Jet 3.5 and Jet 4.0.
However, since the new Odbcjt32.dll installed by MDAC 2.1 or MDAC 2.5 is wired
to use the new version of Jet, the older Jet 3.5 DLLs are no longer used by the
Access ODBC driver.

To determine which version of the Microsoft Access ODBC driver is installed, open
the ODBC Administrator and click on the Drivers tab. Examine the version number
of the driver named "Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb)". If the version starts
with 3.5, you are using the Access ODBC driver that is hard-wired to use Jet
3.5. If the version starts with 4.0, you are using the Access ODBC driver that
is hard-wired to use Jet 4.0.

Listing of Backward Compatibility Issues with the Microsoft Access ODBC Driver that Ships with MDAC 2.1, MDAC 2.1 SP1, MDAC 2.1 SP2, MDAC 2.5, MDAC 2.5 SP1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. The MDAC 2.1 and MDAC 2.5 version of the Access ODBC Driver does not write to
  older format-replicated databases. If you have an Access design master or
  replica database in Access 97 format (or Access 95 format), the MDAC 2.1 (or
  MDAC 2.5) Access ODBC driver can open this database, but only in read-only
  mode. In order to both read and write with ODBC, you need to use the
  Microsoft Access ODBC driver that shipped with MDAC 2.0. The error reported
  when attempting to update an older format replica database is "Operation not
  supported on replicable databases that have not been converted to the current
  version." Workarounds include converting the database to Access 2000 format,
  dropping back to the MDAC 2.0 SP2 version of the ODBC driver, or
  unreplicating the database.


2. The Paradox ODBC driver that ships with MDAC 2.1 and MDAC 2.5 is read-only
  unless the Borland Database Engine (BDE) is installed. See the following
  article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base article for more information:

  Q230126 ACC2000: Using Paradox Data with Access 2000 and Jet

  However, Microsoft has created new Paradox ISAM drivers for Microsoft Jet 4.0
  that do not require the installation of the BDE to provide full read/write
  access to Paradox files. See the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
  Base article for more information:

  Q263561 INFO: Non-BDE Paradox and dBase ISAM Drivers

3. The dBase ODBC driver that ships with MDAC 2.1 and MDAC 2.5 is read-only
  unless the BDE is installed. See the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base article for more information:

  Q230125 ACC2000: Using dBASE Data with Access 2000 and Jet

  However, Microsoft has created new dBase ISAM drivers for Microsoft Jet 4.0
  that do not require the installation of the Borland Database Engine (BDE) to
  provide full read/write access to dBASE files. See the following article in
  the Microsoft Knowledge Base article for more information:

  Q263561 INFO: Non-BDE Paradox and dBase ISAM Drivers

4. Installing MDAC 2.1 or MDAC 2.5 may break all applications that use the
  Microsoft FoxPro ODBC driver. Developers need to switch to the Visual FoxPro
  ODBC driver. See the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
  article for more information:

  Q235357 PRB: FoxPro ODBC Driver Replaced by Visual FoxPro ODBC Driver

5. Customers have reported several major performance issues with the Microsoft
  Access ODBC driver that ships with MDAC 2.1 and later. Performance drops of
  up to 400% between the Jet 3.5-based ODBC driver and the Jet 4.0-based ODBC
  driver have been reported.

  Reported issues include slower connection opens (SQLConnect), slower SQL
  command executions (SQLExecDirect), slower record insertions when using
  date/time fields, slower scrolling (SQLSetPos), and slower data retrieval
  (SQLGetData) performance. The following Knowledge Base article discusses
  these issues:

  Q168686 PRB: Performance Loss When Upgrading Jet ODBC Driver

6. The newer Access ODBC driver now follows the ANSI 92 SQL specification,
  because Jet 4.0 follows this specification. This can cause SQL statements
  that worked properly with the Jet 3.5-based ODBC driver to fail to produce
  the desired results. The following Knowledge Base articles detail these
  issues:

  Q237992 PRB: Query Testing for NULL in Access Database Does Not Return
  Records with Jet 4.0


7. There is a known bug in SQLBindCol where a memory leak occurs with the MDAC
  2.1 version of the Access ODBC Driver. This issue is fixed in MDAC 2.1 SP2.


8. Inserting data into a Bit (Yes/No) field in a Microsoft Access database
  results in the bit field being always False, even when a value of True is
  specified. This issue is fixed in MDAC 2.1 SP2; see the following Knowledge
  Base article for more details:

  Q221184 FIX: Access Bit Fields and MDAC 2.1

9. After installing the newer Access ODBC driver, deleting a record from a
  keyset or dynamic cursor results in the row position becoming out of
  synchronization. For example, after a delete you are supposed to be on record
  5 but you end up on record 10. This issue is fixed in MDAC 2.1 SP2; see the
  following Knowledge Base article for more details:

  Q230131 Access ODBC Keyset Cursor Becomes Corrupt After a Delete

10. Both MDAC 2.1 and MDAC 2.5 versions of the Access ODBC driver report
  unexpected column lengths for text columns when calling SQLColumns. See the
  following Knowledge Base article for more details:

  Q236871 BUG: SQLColumns Return Incorrect BUFFER_LENGTH/CHAR_OCTET_LENGTH


11. The MDAC 2.1 Access ODBC driver is not compatible with earlier versions
  regarding the usage of SQL_ATTR_NOSCAN (SQL_NOSCAN). The MDAC 2.1 Access
  ODBC driver continues to preparse ODBC escape sequences even if it is turned
  off by ODBC API calls.

  This problem is fixed with the MDAC 2.5 Access ODBC driver.


12. The MDAC 2.1 and MDAC 2.5 Access ODBC drivers do not support the usage of
  literal GUIDs in SQL statements. The MDAC 2.0 Access ODBC driver supports
  literal GUIDs in SQL statements when ODBC escape sequence preparsing is
  turned off. See the following Knowledge Base article for more details:

  Q170117 HOWTO: Use GUID Fields in Access from Visual C++


13. Both MDAC 2.1 and MDAC 2.5 Access ODBC Drivers break backward compatibility
  with usage of the LIKE clause. This is a rare issue where a text field
  contains the caret character ('^') and you try to select the field using a
  like clause. For example, if a field f1 contains the value 'C^C' and you
  attempt to select the record using the following SQL statement, the record
  is not be selected:

  SELECT * FROM Test WHERE f1='C^C'


14. With the Access ODBC driver that ships with MDAC 2.1 and MDAc 2.5, double
  quotes can no longer be used as string literals in SQL statements. For
  example, the following SQL statement works properly with the MDAC 2.0 driver
  but returns an error ([Microsoft][ODBC Microsoft Access Driver] Too few
  parameters. Expected 1.) when using the MDAC 2.1 driver:

  SELECT "Test" AS F1 FROM Test


  Using single quotes for string literals works with both drivers.

15. Customers have reported database bloating issues with the MDAC 2.1 and MDAC
  2.5 versions of the Access ODBC driver. Jet 4.0 now stores all text data as
  Unicode, and this can require twice as much space as ANSI text (two times
  the amount of bloating due to Unicode storage of data). Also, there is a
  record locking issue with MDAC 2.1 that is fixed by installing MDAC 2.1 SP2.
  See the following Knowledge Base article for more details:

  Q239527 ACC2000: Database Bloats When Importing Large Text File

16. Both MDAC 2.1 and MDAC 2.5 versions of the Access ODBC driver may return
  invalid ordinals when calling SQLColumns. If you create a table in Access
  and later remove a column, the column ordinals reported by the Access ODBC
  driver when calling SQLColumns are not in sequence. For example, if you
  create a table with 4 columns and then delete column 2, the reported column
  ordinals are 1,3,4 rather than 1,2,3. According to the ODBC specification
  (SQLColumns, ORDINAL_POSITION), the ordinal positions of the columns must
  start with 1 and must be in sequence.


17. Both MDAC 2.1 and MDAC 2.5 versions of the Access ODBC driver rename some
  native data types from the previous version. If you call SQLGetTypeInfo, the
  following type names are renamed:

   MDAC 2.0 Name    MDAC 2.1 and MDAC 2.5 Name
   -------------   ----------------------------
    LONGTEXT             LONGCHAR
    LONG                 INTEGER
    TEXT                 VARCHAR


18. The MDAC 2.1 Access ODBC driver reported an incorrect column length when
  calling SQLDescribeCol on a calculated textual field. For example, if you
  submitted the following SQL statement, SQLDescribeCol returns 2147483598 as
  the length of calculated column and not the expected 255 (standard length of
  text column reported by the MDAC 2.0 Access ODBC driver):

  SELECT [CompanyName] + [ContactName] AS x FROM Customers

  This bug is fixed in MDAC 2.1 SP1 and all later MDAC 2.1 service packs.


19. When using the MDAC 2.1 or MDAC 2.5 Access ODBC driver with
  SQLConfigDataSource and REPAIR_DB, the call fails if the database name is
  not enclosed in double quotes. With the MDAC 2.0 driver the double quotes
  are not needed. This issue is fixed in MDAC 2.1 SP2.


20. When using the MDAC 2.1 or MDAC 2.5 version of the Microsoft Access ODBC
  driver and opening a Microsoft Access database file on a network share, an
  excessive amount of network packet activity occurs, even when the ODBC
  connection is idle. This is due to the newer driver interpreting the
  PageTimeout setting correctly (whereas the MDAC 2.0 driver interpreted it
  incorrectly).

the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q246560 BUG: Excessive Network Activity When Using Access ODBC Driver

21. With both MDAC 2.1 and MDAC 2.5 Access ODBC drivers, using the SQL keyword
  TEXT without a length specifier in DDL now maps to a memo field (with the
  MDAC 2.0 driver, TEXT would map to TEXT(255)). For example, the following
  SQL statement creates a TEXT(255) field with the MDAC 2.0 driver and a MEMO
  field when using the MDAC 2.1 driver:

  CREATE TABLE Test (f1 TEXT)

22. When executing a parameterized query that contains a subquery with the MDAC
  2.1 or MDAC 2.5 version of the Access ODBC Driver, parameter markers are
  processed in an unexpected order. Rather than processing the parameter
  markers from left to right as they appear in SQL, the parameter markers in
  the subquery are processed first, and then the main query parameter markers
  are processed. See the following Knowledge Base article for more
  information:

  Q244719 FIX: Parameter Mismatch with Sub queries When Using Access ODBC

  This problem was corrected in Microsoft Jet 4.0 Service Pack 4.

23. When you open and close multiple statements under a single HDBC while using
  Microsoft Access ODBC Driver (both MDAC 2.1 and MDAC 2.5 versions), memory
  usage climbs until you close the parent HDBC. Also, when you open and close
  multiple rowsets under a single session while using Microsoft Jet OLE DB
  Provider 4.0, memory usage climbs until you release the parent session. The
  memory usage issue can be reproduced using ADO, ODBC, or OLE DB as the
  client API. See the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article for more
  information:

  Q247140 Memory Use Climbs with Multiple Recordsets Under a Single Jet Session

Starting with Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) version 2.6, MDAC no longer
contains the following Jet components:

- Microsoft Jet

- Microsoft Jet OLE DB Provider

- ODBC Desktop Database Drivers

Base:
