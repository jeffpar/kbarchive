-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Systems Management Server 2.0 client on a 3Com Edgeserver with
more than 25 bound netcards and you configure the netcards to receive calls
only, discovery does not find any netcards on the client computer. The
Wnmanual.log file may report the following error message:

  No netcards, or error retrieving netcard info.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, obtain the hotfix referenced in this article or
change the virtual LAN adapters (RAS adapters) to dial out and receive calls.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, perform the following steps on your Systems Management
Server site server:

1. Stop the SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER and SMS_EXECUTIVE services.

2. Copy the updated Compver.ini file to the Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base folder.

3. Copy the hotfixed Clicore.exe file to the
  Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base\&lt;Platform&gt; folder.

4. Copy the hotfixed Smsdiscv.dll file to the \Sms\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder.

5. Start the SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER and SMS_EXECUTIVE services.

Allow the updated Compver.ini and Clicore.exe files to be propagated to all logon
points and client access points (CAPs) in the site.

NOTE: The default Client Configuration Installation Manager (CCIM) polling
interval is 23 hours. Therefore, it may take up to 23 hours for the hotfixed
files to be propagated to the clients. To speed up this process, you can stop
and restart the SMS Client Service on each client. You can also create a
software distribution for one of the Setevnt.exe or Cliutils.exe Resource Kit
tools along with the appropriate parameters to start a CCIM work cycle. For
information on the proper syntax to use with these tools, see the Resource Kit
documentation.
