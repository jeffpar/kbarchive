SUMMARY
=======

ISAPI Filters that do not register with either High, Medium, or Low priority are
marked as Unknown in the Microsoft Management Console (MMC). Filters marked as
Unknown are called before all filters with any of the three priorities that have
registered for the same notification.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The priority of the installed filters is a read-only metabase property. To find
the priority of the installed filters, you can either use the MMC or one of the
available metabase utilities. The three metabase priority properties are
NotifyOrderLow, NotifyOrderMedium and NotifyOrderHigh, and are available in the
following locations:

  /LM/W3SVC/Filters/Filter
  /LM/W3SVC/n/Filters/Filter

Where Filter is the name of the installed filter and n is the Web Server
instance.

If two or more filters have the same priority and have registered for the same
notification, the FilterLoadOrder determines which is called first. Note that
Global Filters installed under the Master WWW Properties are called before a
filter with the same priority installed under one of the Web Server instances.
