SUMMARY
=======

When you send mail to a personal address book (PAB) distribution list (DL) and
one or more of the recipients on the distribution list is no longer in the
global address list, the non-delivery report (NDR) that is returned to you may
be confusing. This is especially true if the recipient has an Alias value that
is not "user friendly." The following is a sample non-delivery report:

  Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

  Subject: Subject
  Sent: 07/19/1999 3:12 PM
  The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

  c=US;a=
  ;p=Organization;o=ASGM;dda:MSXCHNGE=//o=ORGANIZATION//ou=SITE//cn=Container//cn=CR
  LC4B7A0994; on 07/19/1999 3:12 PM

  The recipient name is not recognized
  The MTS-ID of the original message is: c=US;a=
  ;p=Organization;l=Server1-990719191132Z-116481

  MSEXCH:MSExchangeMTA:ASGM:Server2

Because the intended recipient was in the global address list when you entered
that recipient in the PAB, the Distinguished Name is used to route mail to the
recipient. In this case, the information that "CRLC4B7A0994" is the value of the
last CN value may not be helpful to you, if you need to know the first and last
names of the recipients who do not receive the mail that you send to a PAB DL.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To work around this problem, keep outdated PAB entries synchronized with the
global address list, use server-based DLs, or make sure that the Exchange Server
administrator uses recognizable names for the Alias value to create mailboxes or
custom recipients in the global address list.

Additional query words: OL97, OL98, OL20
