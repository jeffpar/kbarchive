MORE INFORMATION
================

Page xxiv: Correction To Viewing EBook Instructions
---------------------------------------------------

Page xxiv, third paragraph under Viewing the Online Version of the Book:
Change: "...on your desktop or by opening the file d:\book\RunAcc97.chm (where d
is the drive letter of your CD-ROM drive)."
To: "...on your desktop." (without the quotation marks)


Page 137: Table 5-6, LIKE "#####-####" Should Be In Left Column
---------------------------------------------------------------

Page 137, table 5-6, row 2:
Move

  LIKE "#####-####"

from the right column to the left column.


Page 149: Missing Information About Deleting Relationships
----------------------------------------------------------

Page 149 does not go into the details of how to delete a relationship. One clue
is in the very next two sentences:

  To see the relationships defined for any particular table or query, include
  it in the Relationships window by using the Show Table dialog box, and then
  click the Show Direct Relationships button on the toolbar or choose Show
  Direct from the Relationships menu. To redisplay all relationships, click the
  Show All Relationships button on the toolbar or choose Show All from the
  Relationships menu.

Once you have removed a table from the relationships display, you can get it back
easily. To remove a relationship, make sure you can see the two participating
tables, then click the linking line to select it, if you double-click, you'll
open the edit dialog box. Click the Delete key to remove the relationship.

A short section on changing and deleting relationships will be added to the next
edition.


Page 304: Error in qryXmplContractsInLast6Months Query
------------------------------------------------------

The qryXmplContractsInLast6Months query, as well as some other action queries may
return the following error:

  Couldn't delete from specified tables.

This error results from a change to make Access more compliant with the ANSI SQL
standard. This query works if you add the Access-specific DISTINCTROW keyword by
setting Unique Records to yes. The corrected SQL is:

     DELETE DISTINCTROW tblClubs.*
     FROM qryXmplContractsInLast6Months RIGHT JOIN tblClubs ON
     qryXmplContractsInLast6Months.ClubID = tblClubs.ClubID
     WHERE (((tblClubs.ClubID)&lt;[Don't Delete ClubID Greater Than:]) AND
     ((qryXmplContractsInLast6Months.ClubID) Is Null));


Page 447: Scroll bar does not advance to second page of record
--------------------------------------------------------------

On page 447, the first paragraph instructs you to use the scroll bar or the page
down button to advance to the next page of the record. The scroll bar does not
work to advance to the next page of the record.

Change: "To see the second page of information for any author, use the scroll bar
along the right side of the form or press the PgDn key."

To: "To see the second page of information for any author, press the PgDn key."
(without the quotation marks)


Several Chapters of Online Book Do Not Display Correctly
--------------------------------------------------------

When you display chapters 22-24 of the online book in your Web browser, the
chapter may display correctly only to the first code sample. After the code
sample the text may appear as HTML code.

This error is caused by the use of the &lt;plaintext&gt; tags to denote code that
should not be executed by the browser.

This error will be corrected in a future edition of the book.


CD: Contains IE 3.0 Not IE 4.0 (4th Printing)
---------------------------------------------

The 4th and 5th printings of Running Microsoft Access 97 provide instructions for
installing Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 from the accompanying CD-ROM.
However, the CD-ROM does not include IE 4.0. It does include IE 3.0.

To install Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 from the CD-ROM, please follow these
steps:

1. Insert the CD-ROM in your CD-ROM drive.

2. On the Start menu, click Run.

3. In the Open box, type "d:\ie30\setup" (without the quotation marks) (or
  replace the letter "d" with the appropriate CD-ROM drive letter).

4. Click OK, and then follow the directions on the screen.

The latest version of Microsoft Internet Explorer can be downloaded from
http://www.microsoft.com/ie/download/windows.htm.


Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of the book, it may already
contain the above corrections.
