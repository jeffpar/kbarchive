-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
- Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The WinSock 2.0 installer program (Ws2setup.exe version 4.71.0030.1) posted on
the Microsoft Web site was updated on April 13, 1998, to fix two problems. Note
that the version number of this file has not changed; the simplest way to verify
that you have the latest copy is to check the version of the Vnbt.386 file in
your Windows\System folder against the information shown below.

MORE INFORMATION
================

File Information
----------------

This is the file information for the earlier Vnbt.386 file:

  Vnbt.386 version 4.10.1656  dated 02/06/98 1:00pm  87,745 bytes

If this version is located in the Windows\System folder, you should obtain and
run the current version of the WinSock 2.0 installer.

This is the file information for the current Vnbt.386 file:

  Vnbt.386 version 4.10.1658  dated 03/20/98 6:00pm  87,765 bytes

If this version is located in the Windows\System folder, the current version of
WinSock 2.0 has already been installed.

Problems Resolved by Current Release
------------------------------------

- Version checking was not performed on the Msvcrt.dll file (located in the
  Windows\System folder); this file was automatically overwritten with version
  5.00.7022. Programs that require newer versions of this dynamic-link library
  (DLL) may not work.

- The Vnbt.386 file installed into the Windows\System folder had an internal
  problem: any attempt at NetBIOS name resolution on a name of 15 characters
  containing at least two periods (.) resulted in internal memory problems. The
  name resolution could be by any method (such as a NET USE command,
  double-clicking a Network Neighborhood resource, or programmatically by a
  program). Enabling or disabling DNS made no difference, the problem occurred
  if any of the forms listed above was passed to Vnbt.386.

  This problem could cause Windows to stop responding (hang) without warning.
  Note that the Vnbt.386 file is TCP/IP-specific; NetBIOS name resolution on
  NetBEUI and IPX/SPX were not affected.

- Data corruption of large buffers passed into recv as described in the
  following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
