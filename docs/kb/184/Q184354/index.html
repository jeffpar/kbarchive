SYMPTOMS
========

Subprojects are not inheriting the working folder setting from the parent
project as expected.

CAUSE
=====

You have overridden the normal behavior by explicitly setting the working folder
for subproject(s). This results in a Dir= variable being set under the
subproject section header in your Ss.ini file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To restore the working folder inheritance, you need to edit the user's
..Vss\Users\&lt;username&gt;\Ss.ini file and completely remove the Dir variable
under the appropriate subproject section header.

For example, you may have something that looks similar to the following in your
Ss.ini file:

  [$/Project1]
     Dir(PC) = c:\Project1

     ;Setting the working folder then deleting it from the GUI leaves the Dir
     variable, but the value will be blank.
     [$/Project1/Sub1]
     Dir(PC) =

     [$/Project1/Sub2]
     Dir(PC) = c:\temp

Default working folder propagation works again only after the "Dir(PC)" lines
under each subproject section header are completely removed and the Ss.ini file
saved.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When setting the working folder of a top-level Visual SourceSafe (VSS) project,
by default all subprojects assume a working folder based on a mirror of the
project's directory structure on disk.

For example, suppose you have the following project structure in VSS:

  $/Project1

               /Sub1
                    /SubofSub1
               /Sub2

Setting the working folder for $/Project1 to C:\Project1 implicitly sets the
working folder of the subprojects to C:\Project1\Sub1,
C:\Project1\Sub1\SubofSub1 and C:\Project1\Sub1\Sub2, respectively.

If you explicitly set the working folder of a subproject, you are essentially
telling VSS, "Don't assume a working folder for this subproject", which in some
cases may be desired. VSS accomplishes this by adding the Dir variable under the
subproject's header section in the Ss.ini file.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a project structure in VSS similar to the one above.

2. Explicitly set the working folder for the subproject /Sub1 by highlighting it
  and choosing Set Working Folder from the File menu.

3. Choose a folder and click OK.

4. Now open the Set Working Folder dialog box again, and delete the chosen
  folder setting from the Name text box, then click OK. These steps remove the
  working folder for /Sub1 and create the Dir()=&lt;blank&gt; in your Ss.ini
  file after you exit the VSS explorer.

5. Now set the working folder for $/Project1. $/Project1/Sub1, or any of its
  subprojects, will not have its working folder set, but $/Project1 and
  $/Project1/Sub2 will have the working folder set.

NOTE: To maintain the default behavior of working folder inheritance, avoid
setting the working folders for subprojects explicitly.
