SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications dialogs collection and
set a password for a document, the password is not saved with the document.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you use the wdDialogFileSaveAs dialog box constant to
display the FileSaveAs dialog box, and set the password for a document, while
the File Save As dialog box is displayed.

WORKAROUND
==========

Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without warranty
either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied
warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular purpose. This
article assumes that you are familiar with the programming language being
demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug procedures. Microsoft
support professionals can help explain the functionality of a particular
procedure, but they will not modify these examples to provide added
functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific needs. If you have
limited programming experience, you may want to contact a Microsoft Certified
Partner or the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more
information about Microsoft Certified Partners, please visit the following
Microsoft Web site:

For more information about the support options that are available and about how
to contact Microsoft, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

The command line you normally use to display the File Save As dialog box is as
follows:

     Dialogs(wdDialogFileSaveAs).Show

To display the File Save As dialog box and save a password that you set (as if
clicking Options in the File Save As dialog box) use the following macro
commands instead of Dialogs(wdDialogFileSaveAs).Show:

     Sub SaveDocPasswordWorkAround()

        Dim dlg As Dialog
        Dim dlgParm As String

        ' If no documents are open to save, then exit this routine.
        If Documents.Count = 0 Then Exit Sub

        ' Set object variable to the File Save As dialog box.
        Set dlg = Dialogs(wdDialogFileSaveAs)

        ' Display the dialog box.
        dlg.Display
        ' Extract the name to save as (typed into the File Name text box.)
        dlgParm = dlg.Name
        ' Force an update to the dialog box.
        dlg.Update
        ' Reset the file name.
        dlg.Name = dlgParm
        ' Execute the dialog box commands.
        dlg.Execute

     End Sub

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

This problem has been corrected in Word 2000.
