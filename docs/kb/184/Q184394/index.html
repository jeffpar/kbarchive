-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
- Microsoft Personal Web Server versions 1.0, 1.0a for Windows 95 
- the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

After you perform an upgrade from Microsoft Personal Web Server (PWS) version
1.x for Windows 95 to version 4.0, Network properties still shows Personal Web
Server listed as a networking service.

WARNING: Do not try to remove the service from the Network properties applet,
because this will de-register PWS version 4.0, requiring you to uninstall and
reinstall the 4.0 version.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by a registry key that is left during the upgrade
installation of the new Personal Web Server.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

The PWS service registry entry can be removed by following these steps:

1. Click the Start button.

2. Click Run.

3. Type "regedit" (without the quotation marks) in the dialog box and click OK.

4. Browse and select the following key:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Enum\Network\MSWEBSVR

  NOTE: Verify that the key name displayed in the status bar on the bottom of
  the Registry Editor matches the key you selected.

5. Click Edit on the toolbar.

6. Click Delete on the drop-down menu.

7. Click Yes when asked if you are sure you want to delete the key.

8. Exit the Registry Editor.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
