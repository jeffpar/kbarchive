-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft ODBC Driver for Oracle (Build 2.06325), version 1.0 
- Microsoft ODBC for Oracle version 2.0, versions Build 2.73.7269, Build 2.73.7283.01, Build 2.73.7283.03 
- Microsoft Data Access Components version 1.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Microsoft Oracle ODBC driver (Msorcl32.dll) provided with the
Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) 1.5x and more than 64K of data is
returned to the client computer in a scrollable or keyset driven recordset,
temporary files may be created in the root of the primary drive.

This causes problems on secured computers where the users are not permitted to
write to the root of the primary drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are currently no configuration options available to change the location of
these temporary files. However, below are some workarounds that can help
alleviate this problem.

- Change the application to use the ODBC Cursor Library. This also creates
  temporary files, but they will be located in the default working directory of
  the application.

- Use a forward-only cursor that will not buffer records.

- Return small recordsets that will not exceed the driver's 64K buffer.

- Grant sufficient permissions to the root of the primary drive to allow the
  creation of temporary files.

The latest version of the Microsoft Oracle ODBC driver fixes this problem by
creating the temporary files in the subdirectory of the application.

STATUS
======

This bug has been fixed in the 2.573.2927 version of the Microsoft Oracle ODBC
driver available in Visual Studio 6.0 and Microsoft Data Access Components
version 2.0 and later. The MDAC files can be downloaded from the following Web
site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/data/

MORE INFORMATION
================

When Microsoft's Oracle ODBC driver exceeds its internal storage buffer size of
64K, a temporary file is created in the root of the primary drive to hold the
cached records. If the user does not have sufficient permissions to create files
in the root of the primary drive, a General Error is returned to the client.

These file names typically begin with the letter "t" followed by a number and
another letter, such as "t6a", "t5b.3" and "t4i.2".

The following error information may be returned to the client during a Fetch
operation:

  SqlState S1000, ErrorMsg = "[Microsoft][ODBC driver for Oracle] General
  error"
