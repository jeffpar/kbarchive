-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Outlook 97, versions 8.0, 8.01, 8.02, 8.03 
- Microsoft Outlook 98 
- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Exchange and Outlook clients are unable to parse one-off SMTP
addresses in the following forms:

  &lt;someone@microsoft.com&gt;
  First Last &lt;someone@microsoft.com&gt;
  (First Last) &lt;someone@microsoft.com&gt;
  "First Last" &lt;someone@microsoft.com&gt;
  (First Last) someone@microsoft.com
  "First Last" someone@microsoft.com
  First Last &lt;"&lt;First&gt;Last"@microsoft.com&gt;
  (First Last) "&lt;First&gt;Last"@microsoft.com
  someone@microsoft.com (First Last)
  someone@microsoft.com "First Last"
  &lt;someone@microsoft.com&gt; (First Last)
  &lt;someone@microsoft.com&gt; "First Last"

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Exchange clients and Microsoft Outlook 97 client versions 8.00, 8.01,
8.02, and 8.03 only accept one-off SMTP addresses in the form of:

  someone@microsoft.com

Microsoft Outlook 98 version 8.50 accepts one-off SMTP addresses in the following
forms:

  someone@microsoft.com
  First Last &lt;someone@microsoft.com&gt;

Outlook 98 parses the SMTP address from the one-off string in the last example
above, but it uses the full original string as the display name.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the one-off SMTP addressing forms supported by the Outlook and Exchange
clients.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


Additional SMTP one-off address parsing features are now available from Microsoft
as an official hotfix for Outlook and Exchange clients. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed above.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.


This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 2.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Exchange and Outlook clients can parse one-off SMTP addresses and
display names in the following forms when you apply the hotfix:

  someone@microsoft.com
  &lt;someone@microsoft.com&gt;
  First Last &lt;someone@microsoft.com&gt;
  (First Last) &lt;someone@microsoft.com&gt;
  "First Last" &lt;someone@microsoft.com&gt;
  (First Last) someone@microsoft.com
  "First Last" someone@microsoft.com
  First Last &lt;"&lt;First&gt;Last"@microsoft.com&gt;
  (First Last) "&lt;First&gt;Last"@microsoft.com
  "First Last" "&lt;First&gt;Last"@microsoft.com
  someone@microsoft.com (First Last)
  someone@microsoft.com "First Last"
  &lt;someone@microsoft.com&gt; (First Last)
  &lt;someone@microsoft.com&gt; "First Last"

These additional addressing forms are only available as one-off addresses. The
new parsing code successfully parses the display names and e-mail addresses from
the strings. For example, if someone entered the following string as a one-off:

    First Last &lt;someone@microsoft.com&gt;

it would be parsed as follows:

  Display Name: First Last
  E-mail Address: someone@microsoft.com

The new parsing functionality only applies to one-off SMTP addresses. PAB SMTP
addresses still need to be entered as follows:

  Display Name: First Last
  E-mail Address: someone@microsoft.com

The new SMTP parsing code is only invoked when an SMTP address has been entered
as a one-off on the "TO" line and a "check names" has been performed, or when
the Outlook background name check thread is invoked.

The Outlook background name check thread is executed when an SMTP one-off address
has been entered and the TAB key is selected to advance to the next field. The
Outlook background name check thread was designed to remove white space from the
one-off string. This was a useful feature for eliminating typos before
processing the address. However, this feature needed to be removed, because the
clients are now able to parse complex strings and addresses that may contain
spaces. The new SMTP one-off parsing functionality was added to Mapi32.dll. The
Outlook background name check function was modified in Outllib.dll. These were
separate modifications, but both should be implemented when using the Outlook
client. If the Outllib.dll is not updated, the display name will be parsed
without a space and will appear as:

  Display Name: FirstLast
  E-mail Address: someone@microsoft.com
