-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Lsass.exe on a primary domain controller (PDC) will show very high levels of CPU
usage (above 50 percent). If a backup domain controller (BDC) is promoted to
PDC, the problem will follow the new PDC. Using the checked version of Netlogon,
you will see one or more logon requests being issued from various client
computers every 60 seconds.

CAUSE
=====

When using the checked version of Netlogon.dll, you may see multiple lines in
Netlogon.log that have 0xC0000071 messages occurring within a second or so of
each other from one client. The 0xC0000071 means that STATUS_PASSWORD_EXPIRED,
so you will see this messages only from users that are still logged on, but
whose passwords have expired. If you do a Network Monitor trace from the client
computer, you will see an SMB Session Setup every 60 seconds for each Systems
Management Server site server that the CLIMONNT process has been configured
for.

All of these logon requests are redirected back to the PDC from the validating
BDC because the BDC is not sure about the user's password, so the LSASS process
on the PDC starts growing. For example, consider 300 clients with expired
passwords are logged on and configured to look to six different Systems
Management Server site servers every 60 seconds. The number of logon requests
that the PDC must process each minute is: (6 * 300) = 1,800. All 1,800 will fail
and are wasted attempts.

Normally, the CLIMONNT service wakes up every 24 hours to see if there are any
jobs to process. When a client's password has expired, CLIMONNT wakes up, then
tries each server in the list and each server will fail. CLIMONNT will then
sleep for another 60 seconds and try contacting each server again. This cycle
repeats every 60 seconds, until the user eventually logs off and logs back on,
forcing the user to change his or her password.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, contact Microsoft Technical Support to obtain the
following fix, or wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack. The
hotfix should have the following timestamp:

     04/22/98   08:18 PM        182KB      Climonnt.exe (Alpha)
     04/22/98   08:23 PM         80KB      Climonnt.exe (INTEL)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression- tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
