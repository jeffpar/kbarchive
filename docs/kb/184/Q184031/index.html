- Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
- Microsoft Proxy Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======



SYMPTOMS
========

When you access an Internet site through a Proxy Server that is installed on a
Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 computer, you may receive the
following error(s):

  Internet Explorer cannot open the Internet Site &lt;URL&gt;

  A connection with the server could not be established

  11001 Host not found

  Unable to form connection to the server.

  The path c:\&lt;path_name&gt;\w3proxy.dll failed to load
  The data is the error
  Error 14

CAUSE
=====

In Internet Explorer 4.0, the error message, "Internet Explorer cannot open the
Internet Site &lt;URL&gt;," can occur when a connection with the server could
not be established.

In Internet Explorer 3.0x, the error message, "Internet Explorer cannot open
http://&lt;servername&gt;," may be due to the properties of the default Web site
in the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) having the IP Address field set to an
IP address on the external NIC (or Dial-up Connection). This seems to occur only
when there is just one Web site (the default Web site, not including the
administration Web site).

The error message, "11001 Host not found," may be due to the properties of the
default Web site in the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) having the IP Address
field set to an IP address on the internal NIC. Again, this seems to occur only
when there is just one Web site (the default Web site, not including the
administration Web site). This error message can also occur when the Auto Dial
shared service of the Proxy Server in the IIS Console is not set correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

Open the Default Web Site Properties and change the IP Address field to All
Unassigned.

-AND/OR-

Edit the Default Web Site properties. Click the Advanced button on the Web Site
tab. Click the Add button in the "Multiple identities for this Web Site" section
and remove the Host Header Name entry.

If necessary, create a new site that will host the content that you wish to
publish on the internet or intranet. Assign an external or internal IP address
to this new Web site. Remember to stop and restart the browser after making this
change.

Make sure that the settings to Enable Dialing for the Winsock and Web Proxys also
check the Credentials. Verify that these are correct and line up with the DUN.
