-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After installing the first Exchange Server 5.x computer in a 4.0 site, an
administrator may receive the following error message when trying to create a
mailbox or access e-mail properties:

"An error occurred while processing an e-mail address. To view details of the
error, see the application event log in the Windows NT Event Viewer on the
Microsoft Exchange Server computer. Microsoft Exchange Administrator ID no:
c1030b37."

This error message can occur in all versions of the Exchange Administrator
program.

In the Event viewer, the following 2034 error may occur twice in succession:

  Event ID: 2034
  Source: MSExchangeSA
  Description: Unable to generate an E-mail address. The 'CCMail - General
  Error (Code 1)' address type was returned by address generation dll
  c:\exchsrvr\address\CCMAIL\i386\ccmproxy.dll.

Inspection of the site will probably show that cc:Mail proxy generators have been
replicated throughout the site (view under &lt;Site&gt;, Configuration,
Addressing, E-Mail Address Generators), but that the cc:Mail proxy address type
(view under &lt;Site&gt;, Configuration, Site Addressing) no longer exists on
any server.

NOTE: The Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail is a feature first added
in Exchange Server version 5.0. When the first server running version 5.0 or
later is added to an Exchange Server 4.0 site, the cc:Mail address proxy type
and cc:Mail address generators should be replicated throughout the 4.0 site,
even if you do not install the cc:Mail connector itself. Until the connector is
installed, the address type is simply disabled.

CAUSE
=====

Routing Recalculation is set to Always for the site. Whenever routing is
recalculated, the Site Addressing object on the routing recalculation server is
updated and replicated to all other servers in the site.

If routing recalculation occurs near the time of the new installation, the Site
Addressing object on the routing recalculation server may appear to be "newer"
than the version on the just-installed server. Thus it will overwrite the 5.5
version of Site Addressing, effectively deleting the cc:Mail proxy address type
throughout the site.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are three ways to work around this problem:

WORKAROUND 1:

Set Routing Recalculation to Selected Times, and select a time far away from the
time at which you are installing the new server. It is seldom desirable to set
Routing Recalculation to Always.

WORKAROUND 2:

Connect to the routing recalculation server to join the site, thus ensuring that
replication is in synchronization between the two servers.

WORKAROUND 3:

1. Immediately after installation finishes, go to the Site Addressing object on
  the new server and verify that the cc:Mail proxy type still exists.

2. Go then to the Routing Calculation Schedule page of the Site Addressing
  object. Change the schedule from Selected Times to Always, and choose Apply.
  Then change the schedule back to Selected Times and choose Apply. Repeat this
  procedure several times.

  Each time you do this, you increment the Object-Version attribute of the Site
  Addressing object by one. The replica with the highest Object- Version
  attribute wins in a replication conflict, even if the change has an older
  time stamp than another change. Do not unintentionally leave the schedule at
  Always after completing this.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 5.0 and 5.5. Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: To be sure you have changed the Object-Version to a large enough number,
you can use the Exchange Administrator's raw mode.

To do this:

WARNING: Using the raw mode of the Exchange Administrator program (admin /r)
incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall
Microsoft Windows NT Server and/or Microsoft Exchange Server. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of raw mode can be
solved. Use raw mode at your own risk. Do not make changes to raw mode
properties unless you fully understand their implications. You could make your
entire site unusable or cause other problems by making some changes. Use raw
mode only for viewing the effects of changes made through the normal Property
pages.

1. Start Exchange Server Administrator program in raw mode
  (\exchsrvr\bin\admin.exe /r).

2. Connect to the routing recalculation server, and select its Site Addressing
  object.

3. Choose File, Raw Properties, or press SHIFT+ENTER to view the raw properties
  of the Site Addressing object.

4. Select the Object-Version attribute and note its value.

5. Connect to the newly installed server, and perform steps 2 through 4.

The value on the newly installed server should be larger by a dozen or so than
the value on the routing recalculation server. Follow the procedure outlined
above in Workaround 3 until the Object-Version is high enough on the new
server.
