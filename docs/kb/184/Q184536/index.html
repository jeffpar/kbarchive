-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

It is not possible to use ~DEL during directory import to remove a single value
from a multi-valued field.

Example:

You want to remove a value from the E-Mail Addresses field for all users for a
connector that has been removed. You can remove them individually through the
Exchange Server Administrator program, but you cannot accomplish this in bulk
through directory import.

CAUSE
=====

The ~DEL value is available as part of the Bulk Import functionality. ~DEL is
used to remove data from specific fields in the user properties. However, ~DEL
will not remove a single value from a multi-valued field such as E-Mail
Addresses.

Example from an import file:

Obj-Class,Directory Name,Home-Server,E-mail addresses
Mailbox,Someone,SERVER,CCMAIL:Someone at SITE
%MS:MSMAILSERVER/MSMAILSITE/SOMEONE%SMTP:Someone@SITE.microsoft.com
%TEST:someone@microsoft%X400:c=US;a= ;p=Org;o=SITE;s=Someone;

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.


Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

An updated version of Dapi.dll enhances the functionality of ~DEL to allow
removal of a single value from a multi-value field.

Using the above import example, you can remove the "TEST:" address type that
currently has a value of "someone@microsoft" by using the following syntax in
the import file:

     Obj-Class,Directory Name,Home-Server,E-mail addresses

     Mailbox,Someone,SERVER,~del&lt;TEST:someone@microsoft&gt;

NOTE: For this method to work, you can ONLY include the value you want to delete
in the multi-valued property. If you include any other values, ~DEL does not
remove the value.

Example that does not work:

     Obj-Class,Directory Name,Home-Server,E-mail addresses

     Obj-Class,Directory Name,Home-Server,E-mail addresses
     Mailbox,Someone,SERVER,CCMAIL:Someone at SITE
     %MS:MSMAILSERVER/MSMAILSITE/SOMEONE%SMTP:Someone@SITE.microsoft.com
     %~&lt;TEST:someone@microsoft&gt;%X400:c=US;a= ;p=Org;o=SITE;s=Someone;

The sample e-mail address depicted herein is fictitious. No association with any
real company, organization, product, person or event is intended or should be
inferred.
