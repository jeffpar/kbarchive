-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 Service Pack 3
(SP3), a new Remote Control Video Helper service, Rchelp.sys, is installed. This
service assists with the Remote Control acceleration driver and is normally
installed by default for all clients that are running Microsoft Windows NT
regardless of whether their driver is actually accelerated.

If the "Install Accelerated Screen Transfer on Windows NT Clients" option is not
selected in Client Properties, Client Configuration Manager marks the Rchelp.sys
file for deletion when the client restarts. The file is removed from the client,
but the service entries in the client's registry are not removed and remain
configured to start.

When the Windows NT client restarts, the following message is displayed:

  At least one service or driver failed during system startup.
  Use Event Viewer to examine the event log for details.

An Event 7026 is recorded in the client's Windows NT Event Viewer system log.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs because the Client Configuration Manager service does not remove the
RCHELP service from the client's registry, even though the file is removed.
Running Upgrade.bat does not correct the problem.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To work around this problem, leave the remote control video acceleration enabled,
or manually change the registry key on the Windows NT client.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Find the following registry key:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\rchelp

3. Change the Start value to 4. This disables the service, which prevents it
  from loading during startup.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems Management
Server version 1.2 Service Pack 3.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression- tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
