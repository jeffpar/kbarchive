-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
- Remote Data Service for ADO versions 1.1, 2.0 
- Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

Because the RDS Datafactory (a single component of RDS) allows implicit remoting
of data access requests by default, it can be exploited to allow unauthorized
Internet clients to access OLE DB datasources available to the server.

A malicious user may be able to gain access to ODBC data, such as data held in
Microsoft SQL Server or Microsoft Access, when connecting to Internet
Information Server (IIS) 4.0 with Microsoft Remote Data Services installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Method One: Remove RDS Functionality
------------------------------------

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To disallow all RDS functionality, you must remove the following registry entries
from the server hosting IIS.

1. Run the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Remove the following registry keys and any subkeys:

  
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
  \W3SVC\Parameters\ADCLaunch\RDSServer.DataFactory

  
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
  \W3SVC\Parameters\ADCLaunch\AdvancedDataFactory

  
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
  W3SVC\Parameters\ADCLaunch\VbBusObj.VbBusObjCls

NOTE: Each of the preceding registry keys is one path; it has been word wrapped
for readability.

Active Server Pages (ASPs) that depend on just ADO (ActiveX Data Objects) for
database connectivity will continue to run.

The Benefits part of the IIS 4.0 sample site, Exploration Air, may not function
correctly if this change is made. There are no other standard features in IIS
4.0 that require RDS.

Method Two: Enforce Correct Security Policy
-------------------------------------------

The following are recommendations that should be followed by all Web developers
who are publishing data in ASP pages:

- Remove all nonessential ODBC drivers, especially the Microsoft Text Driver.

- Tighten NTFS permissions (ACLs) to restrict access to only those you trust.

- If using SQL Server, then enforce strong security measures, such as:

- Run SQL Server as a low-privileged user account.

- Do not allow extended stored procedures.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Description of RDS Datafactory
------------------------------

Remote Data Services (RDS) is part of the Data Access Components installed by
default with Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack and IIS 4.0. With RDS, Web clients can
issue client-based SQL queries to OLE DB data sources hosted on the Web server.

The DataFactory object allows you to connect to a specified data source (such as
SQL Server), using a specified UserID and password, and execute a query against
that server and then return the result set back to the client.

The data source, UserID, password, and SQL statement are passed as parameters to
the method exposed on the DataFactory object. If the registry keys stated above
are removed however, the user will be unable to create the object, therefore
removing any possibility of abuse.
