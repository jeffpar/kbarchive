-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1 
- Microsoft Commercial Internet System version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Microsoft Exchange Chat Service 5.5 Service Pack 1 or
Microsoft Commercial Internet System Chat 2.0 on a Backup Domain Controller
(BDC), the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) does not run. The following error
message appears:

  An application error has occurred and an application error log is being
  generated

  mmc.exe
  Exception access violation (0xc000005) Address 0x10021433

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because the Chat Administrator Account is not created as a
local account on the Backup Domain Controller.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

To correct this problem, export and then merge the Chat Administrator Key from a
Primary Domain Controller (PDC) or Member Server to the BDC. To export the key,
perform the following steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (REGEDT32.exe), and go to the following subkey:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Exchange\ChatSvc
     \Parameters\Accounts

  NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

2. Select Chat Administrator.

3. From the Registry menu, click Export Registry File.

4. Type a File Name and then click Save. Save the file to either the hard disk
  or a floppy disk.

5. Copy this file to the Backup Domain Controller.

6. Double-click on the file in Windows Explorer and the registry key will be
  added.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, install the registry key (see the Resolution
section above), and then install the Microsoft Exchange Chat Service. The MMC
functions properly after these steps have been completed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is not a problem when the Microsoft Exchange Chat Service is installed on a
Primary Domain Controller or a Member Server.
