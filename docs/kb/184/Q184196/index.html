-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After installing Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 3 (SP3), a client
computer may display the following STOP error message at startup:

  STOP: c000026c {Unable to Load Device Driver}
  \&lt;SystemRoot&gt;\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\RCHELP.SYS device driver could not be
  loaded. Error Status was oxc000012f

The computer will no longer complete the boot process and stops responding on
this error message each time you attempt to start it.

CAUSE
=====

The failure occurs because the \&lt;SystemRoot&gt;\System32\Drivers\Rchelp.sys
file was not properly generated when Service Pack 3 was installed on the client.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next SMS 1.2 service pack that contains this fix.

support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
