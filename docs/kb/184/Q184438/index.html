-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may see the following event in the Application event log:

  Event ID: 2011
  Type:     Error
  Source:   MSExchangeISPriv
  Category: Transport
  Description:  Error 0x80040115 occurred while writing delivery log
  information to the Microsoft Exchange System Attendant.

You may also notice the following event in the Application event log:

  Event ID: 5007
  Type:     Warning
  Source:   MSExchangeSA
  Category: General
  Description:  An error occurred during the message tracking decode
  operation.

The effect of the first event (2011) is that the information store stops. Upon
further investigation, you may notice that all Exchange services are hung. The
System Attendant may appear to be started, but it will fail to stop with the
following error:

  Could not stop the Microsoft Exchange System Attendant on SERVER1.
  Error 2186: The service is not responding to the control function.

These events can occur on any computer running Exchange Server 4.0, even with
Service Pack 1, Service Pack 2, Service Pack 3, or Service Pack 4 installed.

CAUSE
=====

The computer running Exchange Server is missing a file necessary for decoding
message tracking information from the Message Transfer Agent (MTA).

See Q161935 "XADM: Message Tracking Error 5007 Caused by Missing *.Arc Files"for
more details.

The Exchsrvr\Tracking.log directory may be filled with thousands of ASNxxxx.tmp
files, and the Acse.arc file may be missing from the Exchsrvr\Bin directory of
the Exchange Server computer. This undoubtedly is the cause of the Event 5007
errors.

The Event 2011 errors are most likely caused by invalid data being written to the
message tracking log. This data, when parsed, causes the System Attendant to
hang, which halts all other Exchange Server services, including the information
store, which is the actual source of the error.

WORKAROUND
==========

This problem can be resolved by copying a valid Acse.arc from another computer
running Exchange Server 4.0.

See Q161935 "XADM: Message Tracking Error 5007 Caused by Missing *.Arc Files" for
details on valid file sizes and dates for *.arc files.

After copying this file, the Exchange Server services will all need to be
restarted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If this does not eliminate the problem, disable Message Tracking on the affected
Exchange Server computer by following the instructions in the following
Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q148963 XADM: Disabling Message Tracking For One or More Servers

This will disable Message Tracking for this server only, as opposed to disabling
Message Tracking for the entire site in the Exchange Server Administrator
program.
