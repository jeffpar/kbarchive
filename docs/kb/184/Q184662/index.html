-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In this scenario, an Exchange site has two servers, and each of them has an
X.400 Connector with the same address space but different costs. For example:

  ServerA with an address space of X.400:&lt;nothing&gt; and a cost of 1
  ServerB with an address space of X.400:&lt;nothing&gt; and a cost of 90

Messages created on a mailbox on ServerB and addressed to an X.400 recipient are
routed this way:

  B -&gt; A -&gt; X.400 Connector

If ServerA goes down, then messages created on a mailbox on ServerB and addressed
to an X.400 recipient are not locally rerouted to ServerB's X.400 Connector but
remain indefinitely in ServerB's MTA queue to ServerA.

NOTE: This happens only with Custom recipients. Messages sent to a one off
address are correctly rerouted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, a manual intervention (modification of the
connector cost, recalculation of the routing table) is required to activate the
rerouting.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server version 5.5.
This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 2.
