SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to export distribution lists (DLs) or custom recipients with
the Command Line Directory Export Utility by using a Directory Export Options
file, the export may be unsuccessful and you may receive a .csv file that
contains only header information.

In the Application event log, the following event may be logged:

  Event ID: 302
  Event Type: Warning
  Event Source: MSExchangeDSExp
  Event Category: None
  Description: No entries had been found for the specified object class DL.

  (When you want to export distribution lists.)

-or-

  Event ID: 302
  Event Type: Warning
  Event Source: MSExchangeDSExp
  Event Category: None
  Description: No entries had been found for the specified object class remote.

  (When you want to export custom recipients.)

NOTE: Directory Export in the Exchange Admin tool functions properly.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because a "HomeServer=&lt;Servername&gt;" line had been
added (with the "Servername" entered into this line) to the Directory Export
Options file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, ensure that the entry for the HomeServer attribute is
blank, similar to the following example:

  HomeServer=

Or, delete the entire line with the HomeServer attribute in the Directory Export
Options file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Neither DLs nor custom recipients have a HomeServer attribute. If a HomeServer
attribute is entered in the Export Options file, the Admin.exe program searches
unsuccessfully for any objects with this HomeServer attribute.

The event that is described in the Symptoms section of this article can be logged
if the "InformationLevel=" entry is set to Full.
