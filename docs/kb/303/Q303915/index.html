-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MechCommander 2.0, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you quit a game to return to the Main Menu in Microsoft MechCommander, the
menu may not be displayed correctly: The screen image may extend beyond the
borders of the monitor. Or, while you are playing the game, textures may not
build correctly.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if both of the following conditions are true:

   - You play the game in a different resolution from the resolution specified
  under the display settings on your computer.

  -and-

- Your system has a GX110 video card based on the Intel 810 chipset.

  NOTE: Although this video card may have 11 megabytes (MB) of VRAM, it does not
  meet the minimum requirement of 6 MB of VRAM for textures.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, use one or both of the following methods, as needed.

Method 1: Screen Image Extends Beyond Monitor Edges
---------------------------------------------------

Play the game in the same resolution as that selected in your computer's display
settings. To determine your system's display settings, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Display.

3. Click the Settings tab.

4. Make note of the Desktop Area or Screen Area setting.

5. Click OK twice.

6. Close Control Panel.
