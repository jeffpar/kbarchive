SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to import an aircraft or a piece of scenery from a newer
version of a Microsoft Flight Simulator or Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator
into an older version, one of the following may occur:

- You may receive errors indicating that this operation is unsupported.

- The operation may simply fail.

- The aircraft that is imported will not behave as expected.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because newer versions of Microsoft Simulators have updated
Aircraft and Scenery files that are not backwards compatible with older versions
of these products.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although it is unsupported by Microsoft Technical Support it is usually possible
to import aircraft and scenery from the previous two versions into the next
available version. It is usually not possible to import aircraft and scenery
from any versions outside those parameters. For example you can import Planes
and Scenery from CFS2 and FS2000 into FS2002 Standard or Professional but you
cannot import Planes and scenery from CFS1, FS98 or FS95 into FS2002 Standard or
Professional.

into later version please see the following articles:
