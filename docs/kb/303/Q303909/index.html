The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MechCommander 2.0, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses known issues that you may experience with Microsoft
MechCommander 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Issue 1
-------

When you start MechCommander, you may receive the either of the following error
messages:

  Cannot find DirectInput functions

-or-

  STOP: Cannot CreateNetLib

This behavior can occur if you choose not to restart your computer after you

Issue 2
-------

When you use the MechCommander Editor, you may receive the following error
message:

  [ASSERT 0] No components in the purchase file.

This behavior occurs if you name your mission "Purchase01". You must select a
different name in this case.

Issue 3
-------

When you are playing a multiplayer game, you cannot download custom insignias,
even though you could download them before.

The Unit Insignia list in Player Preferences (multiplayer) only displays the
first 125 insignias. To clear old insignia files, remove them from the
data\multiplayer\insignia folder.

Issue 4
-------

If you are running Microsoft Windows 2000, you may receive the following error
message:

  Your system is low on virtual memory. Windows is increasing the size of your
  virtual memory paging file. During this process, memory requests for some
  applications may be denied.

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System, and then click the Advanced tab.

3. Click Performance Options, and then click Change under Virtual Memory.

4. Under "Paging File Size for Selected Drive", change the initial size to 250
  MB, change the maximum size to 500 MB, and then click Set.

5. Click OK three times.

Issue 5
-------

If you are running Windows 2000, you may experience choppy playback of audio or
the program may stop responding (hang). These symptoms occur if you are using
cards based on the Aureal Vortex 2 chipset.

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click "Sounds and Multimedia", and then click the Audio tab.

3. Under Sound Playback, click Advanced, and then click the Performance tab.

4. Drag the Hardware Acceleration slider to the left two notches, and then click
  OK twice.

Issue 6
-------

If you quit Microsoft NetMeeting 3.01 improperly, or if Remote Desktop Sharing is
enabled, Direct3D functionality is disabled. When you restart the computer,
Direct3D functionality is not restored.

NetMeeting 3.01 automatically disables Direct3D functionality when it starts.
When you quit NetMeeting properly, it restores Direct3D functionality. To
resolve this issue, start NetMeeting 3.01, and then quit it properly.

Issue 7
-------

Norton Antivirus 2001 slows video playback and goes the game to start slowly.
With Norton Antivirus 2001 Autoprotect running, it may take four to five times
longer than normal to start MechCommander. To resolve this issue, disable Norton
Antivirus before you start the game.

Issue 8
-------

The IntelliPoint ClickLock feature conflicts with right-click mouse camera
control.

When you adjusting camera perspective with the right mouse button, the ClickLock
feature is engaged. To resolve this issue, turn off the ClickLock feature when
you play MechCommander.

computer may stop responding after the opening movies, during the fade into the
menu.
