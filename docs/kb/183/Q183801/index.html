-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server Internet Mail Service can only handle SMTP type
messages. When the Internet Mail Service is configured to send mail of different
type, the message will NDR with the following text in the NDR:

  From: System Administrator
  Sent: Monday, January 05, 1998 8:01 PM
  To: 'user@domain.com'
  Subject: Undeliverable: Test Subject

  Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

     Subject: Test Subject
     Sent: 1/5/98 7:31 PM

  The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

    `user@domain.com' on 1/5/98 8:01 PM
        Unable to deliver the message due to a communications failure
        MSEXCH:IMS:Microsoft:SITE:SERVER 0 (000D06B5) No proxy for
        Recipient

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server version 5.5.
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.5. For information about obtaining the Service Pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although it is not common practice to send messages of a different type to the
Internet Mail Service, there are certain circumstances where mail of a different
type needs to be routed through the Internet Mail Service. However, all mail
that is routed via the Internet Mail Service is actually Internet mail, but with
a different message type. For example, there is an internal SMTP mail system
that you need to send to, but you want to address the mail in the following
format:

  [SMTPOUT:user@internal.domain.com]

Because the Internet Mail Service can only handle SMTP type messages and not
SMTPOUT type messages, you will receive the above NDR after sending the mail.

This functionality will be available in Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 1.
However, the following registry keys need to be implemented in order for this to
work on the computer running the Microsoft Exchange Server Internet Mail
Service.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys and
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

All of the values below will be located in the following registry key:

   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC
   \Parameters

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

  REG_SZ: OverrideProxyOut: This value should contain the outbound address
  type. In our example, this would be SMTPOUT.

  REG_SZ: SiteDomain: This value should contain the local domain name, for
  example, "imc1.domain.com" or "regulardomain.com".

Also, to route that type of message, the address space on the Internet Mail
Service needs the correct type and cost. For the example above, an address space
of SMTPOUT is needed.
