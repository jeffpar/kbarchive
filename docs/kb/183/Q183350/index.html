-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert a bitmap image into a message, and then send the message to a
Microsoft Exchange Server computer, the image may appear as an attached file
with a .att extension when it is received by an e-mail client.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)
database does not contain an entry for the "image/bmp" content type. This entry
is not added to the database by default.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, add an entry for the "image/bmp" content type
manually. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Microsoft Exchange, and then click
  Microsoft Exchange Administrator.

2. In the left pane, click the Protocols object under the appropriate Exchange
  Server computer, and then click Properties on the File menu.

   - If the Use Site Defaults For All Properties check box on the General tab
     is not selected, proceed to step 3.

   - If the Use Site Defaults For All Properties check box is selected, follow
     these steps, and then proceed to step 3:

  a. Click Cancel to close the Protocols property page.

  b. In the left pane of the Administrator window, click the Protocols object
     under the appropriate site, and then click Properties on the File menu.
     Note that the Protocols object appears under the Configuration object.

3. Click the MIME Types tab, and then click New.

4. In the MIME Content Type box, type "image/bmp" (without quotation marks).

5. In the Associated Extension box, type "bmp" (without quotation marks).

6. Click OK, and then click OK again.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post additional
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
