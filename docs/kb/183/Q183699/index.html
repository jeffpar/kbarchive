-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Winsdmp.exe performance is not acceptable when trying to dump the WINS database
of a WINS server with large version ID. An example of a large version ID would
look like the following:

  Hex: 0x1d88100000000

Converting the value to decimal would be:

  5.195235390915e+14

Winsdmp.exe would start counting in intervals of hexadecimal 0x7cf or 1999
decimal. Even when dumping at these intervals, it would take years to reach the
high version ID listed above.

CAUSE
=====

Winsdmp.exe was designed to start from record 0 and serially count up until the
highest version ID was reached.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem.
