The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Systems Management Server secondary site is upgraded or installed, the
site may never go active. If you look at the site's properties in the Systems
Management Server Administrator program, you will see that its status remains at
"Phase 4 Complete."

CAUSE
=====

The final step in a secondary site installation or upgrade process is that the
Site Configuration Manager service running on the secondary site creates a
system job to copy the .ct2 file (which records upgrade success) to its parent
site. If this job fails, the secondary site will remain in a "Phase 4 Complete"
status.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you can do any one of the following (each
workaround is described in more detail in the MORE INFORMATION section of this
article):

- Force the creation of a .ct2 file, which should allow the secondary site
  installation or upgrade to be completed.

  -or-

- Activate the secondary site and use Preinst.exe to perform a manual upgrade.

  -or-

- Rebuild the secondary site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Creating a .Ct2 File
--------------------

To force the Site Configuration Manager service to create a .ct2 file, perform
the following steps:

1. Verify the state of the secondary site by making certain that all Systems
  Management Server services are installed and running. If they are not
  running, this procedure should not be used.

2. Examine the SMS\Site.Srv\Sitecfg.Box directory on the secondary site to see
  if a .ct2 file does not already exist. If it does exist, stop and restart the
  SMS services, and skip to step 6 in this procedure.

3. At the secondary site, copy the SMS\Site.Srv\Sitecfg.Box\SiteCtrl.ct0 file to
  a temporary location. This is a backup copy.

4. Move any other existing .ctx files in this directory to a temporary location.

5. Rename the original SiteCtrl.ct0 file to 00000000.ct1.

6. The Site Configuration Manager service will create a corresponding .ct2 file
  that is forwarded to the primary site by a system job. The secondary site's
  Scheduler, Despooler, and LanSender services are involved with this process.
  If the .ct2 file is not moved within 30 minutes, you can use SMSTrace.exe or
  a text editor to follow processing in those services' logs and identify the
  failure point.

When the primary site has received and processed the secondary site's .ct2 file,
the Sites window in the Systems Management Server Administrator program should
list the secondary site as Active.

Activating the Site and Forcing Another Upgrade
-----------------------------------------------

If you need to recover from a failed secondary site upgrade, you can use the
following steps:

1. If the SMS_UPGRADE_BOOTSTRAP service is still running after 24 hours (from
  the time the upgrade started), use Srvinstw.exe (available with the Windows
  NT Server 4.0 Resource Kit) to remove it.

  NOTE: With Srvinstw.exe, you can remove or install Windows NT Server services
  remotely, as well as locally. You can also use other utilities, such as
  Instsrv.exe, but only with locally installed services.

2. On the secondary site, examine the SMS\Site.srv\Sitecfg.box directory and
  delete any of the bootstrap files. SiteCtrl.ct0 should be the only file in
  that directory.

3. On the secondary site, examine the SMS\Site.srv\Despoolr.box\Receive
  directory and move any files found there to a subdirectory called Temp.

4. If the SMS_SITE_CONFIG_MANAGER service is not installed, use Srvinstw.exe to
  install it (note that you must define the full local path to Siteins.exe).
  For example, use a command like the following:

  C:\SMS\SITE.SRV\X86.BIN\SITEINS.EXE

5. Start the SMS_SITE_CONFIG_MANAGER service. It will check for the
  SMS\System.map and SMS\Site.srv\Sitecfg.ct0 files and start installing the
  SMS services again. Be sure to wait until all the services are installed.

6. Refresh the Sites window in the Systems Management Server Administrator
  program. Make sure that the sites show an Active status and that they are no
  longer in construction. This may take up to 30 minutes.

7. At the parent primary site server, open a command prompt and move to the
  SMS\Site.srv\X86.bin directory. Run the following command:

  PREINST /UPGRADE:&lt;secondary site sitecode&gt;

Rebuilding the Secondary Site
-----------------------------

Depending on the state of the Systems Management Server services on the secondary
site, sometimes it is easier to rebuild the secondary site rather than force the
current upgrade to complete successfully. To rebuild the secondary site, perform
the steps given below.

NOTE: After performing the steps below, the Systems Management Server client will
be "verified" in the same fashion that occurs when a Systems Management Server
service pack is applied. This will occur with the execution of the Systems
Management Server login script (SMSLS) or Runsms.bat files.

Also note that the instructions below will also remove workstation packages from
the users' Package Command Manager (PCM) application. This occurs because the
PCM instruction files will be deleted. If necessary, resend these packages with
new jobs. In addition, Systems Management Server shared network applications
that require a "one-time" installation will again prompt the users for the one
time installation; if Program Group Control (PGC) is not used, this can be
ignored.

To rebuild a secondary site, perform the following steps:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

1. Look in the SMS\Logon.srv\SMSID directory on each Systems Management Server
  logon server (including the secondary site itself), and record the name of
  the .uid file.

  Also record the value of the following registry entry:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Components
     \SMS_Maintenance_Manager\Next SMS Unique ID

  NOTE: The preceding registry key has been wrapped for readability.

2. Stop all SMS SERVER services on the secondary site server and logon servers,
  if necessary.

3. Delete all SMS shares (for example, SMS_SHR, SMS_SHRx, and so on) from each
  server. It is not necessary to delete the SMS_PKGx share or shares used by
  shared network (PGC) applications.

4. Delete the SMS directory structure on each server.

5. Delete the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS registry key from the
  same server(s).

6. At the primary site, use the PREINST /DELSITE command to delete the secondary
  site from the Systems Management Server hierarchy (in the database). Use the
  following syntax for the command:

  PREINST /DELSITE:{&lt;childsitecode&gt;,&lt;parentsitecode&gt;}

  NOTES:

   - The braces are required in this command, but you should replace
     &lt;childsitecode&gt; and &lt;parentsitecode&gt; with the actual site
     codes for the child and parent sites.

   - This action will temporarily strand the client inventory that appears
     under the secondary site in the Systems Management Server database. It
     also possible that an error message will occur when viewing the Sites
     window in the Systems Management Server Administrator program; this is
     normal. After the site is successfully re-created, the client inventory
     will reappear and the error messages will stop occurring.

7. Re-create the secondary site, using the same sitecode as before.

  NOTE: It is very important that you use the same sitecode.

8. Add the logon server back to the secondary site's Site Properties Domains, if
  necessary.

9. Rename the .uid files on each server (using the information you recorded in
  step 1 of this procedure).

10. Examine the "Next SMS Unique ID" value in the registry of the secondary
  site. If necessary, change this value to the value recorded in step 1 above.
  This value will be the next SMSID range that will be assigned to a logon
  server managed by this site server.
