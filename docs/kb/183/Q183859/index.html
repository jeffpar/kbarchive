The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Windows NT system joins a domain, a machine account is created.
Thereafter, when the system boots, it uses the password for that account to
create a secure channel with the domain controller for its domain. Requests sent
on the secure channel are authenticated, and sensitive information (such as
passwords) is encrypted, but the channel is not integrity checked.

Lack of integrity checking means that it is possible for an attacker who can
intercept and modify requests to modify information in requests or responses
undetected.

Use of such an attack to modify group membership information could allow an
attacker who has interactive logon access to a workstation to become
administrator on that workstation.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


MORE INFORMATION
================

A fix to Windows NT 4.0 Netlogon service has been designed that will allow for
integrity checking. After applying this fix, the following Registry values can
be used to modify the behavior of the secure channel between the client and
domain controller. All of the following values can be found in the registry
under the following key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\netlogon\parameters

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

  SignSecureChannel

     Value Type: REG_DWORD - Boolean
     Valid Range: 0 (FALSE) or 1 (TRUE)
     Default: TRUE
     Description: This parameter specifies that all outgoing secure
                  channel traffic should be signed. If SealSecureChannel
                  is also TRUE, it will override any setting for this
                  parameter and force it to TRUE.

  SealSecureChannel

     Value Type: REG_DWORD - Boolean
     Valid Range: 0 (FALSE) or 1 (TRUE)
     Default: TRUE
     Description: This parameter specifies that all outgoing secure
                  channel traffic should be encrypted.

  RequireSignOrSeal

     Value Type: REG_DWORD - Boolean
     Valid Range: 0 (FALSE) or 1 (TRUE)
     Default: FALSE
     Description: This parameter specifies that all outgoing secure
                  channel traffic must be either signed or sealed. Without
                  this parameter, this is negotiated with the Domain
                  Controller. This flag should only be set if ALL of the
                  domain controllers in ALL the trusted domains support
                  signing and sealing. If this parameter is TRUE,
                  SignSecureChannel is implied to be TRUE.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this problem could result in some degree of security
vulnerability in Windows NT version 4.0. This problem was first corrected in
Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server
Edition Service Pack 4.
