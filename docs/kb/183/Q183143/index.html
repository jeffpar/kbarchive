The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

Every time you start Microsoft Access 97, the automatic registration feature
registers Msaccess.exe, the supporting Microsoft Access .dll files, the wizards,
and the file associations of .mdb and .mda files. This registration process
occurs regardless of whether you are running the full version of Microsoft
Access 97 or the run-time version.

Installing a Microsoft Access 97 run-time application on a computer that is
already running Microsoft Access 7.0 associates the .mdb files, the .mda files,
and the wizards with the Microsoft Access 97 run-time executable file. After you
have started the run-time application at least once, double-clicking an .mdb
file results in the operating system attempting to open that file with the
run-time executable instead of with Microsoft Access 7.0.

This article describes two methods to force re-registration of Microsoft Access
7.0 so that files with Microsoft Access file name extensions, such as .mdb
files, are associated with the Microsoft Access 7.0 executable file after you
have installed a Microsoft Access 97 run-time application.

MORE INFORMATION
================

IMPORTANT: This article contains a sample procedure that makes changes to the
Windows 95 registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure you understand
how to restore it if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this,
view the "Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

File associations are stored in the Windows registry. You can use one of the
following methods to change the file associations in the Windows registry.

Method 1: Manual Re-Registration
--------------------------------

1. Insert the Microsoft Access for Windows 95 Disk 1 or the Microsoft Office
  Professional for Windows 95 CD-ROM in the appropriate drive.

2. In Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows NT version 4.0, click the Start button on
  the taskbar, and then click Run.

  In Microsoft Windows NT 3.51, in Program Manager or File Manager, click Run on
  the File menu.

3. Type a command to run the Setup program with the /y switch, for example

  &lt;Drive&gt;:\setup /y

  where &lt;Drive&gt; is the drive letter for your disk or CD-ROM.

4. In the Installation Maintenance dialog box, click Reinstall.

This may not be the best method if you use the Microsoft Access 97 run-time
application regularly, because you must reset the file associations every time
you start the run-time application.

Method 2: Changing File Associations in Code
--------------------------------------------

MSACCREG.DLL is a file that is installed on your computer by Microsoft Access
7.0. If you accepted the default folders during installation, the file is
located in the folder C:\MSOffice\Access\MSACCREG.DLL. When you use Regsvr32.exe
to register this .dll file, all files with Microsoft Access file name extensions
are associated with the Microsoft Access 7.0 executable file. If Regsvr32.exe
does not already exist on your hard drive, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base for information about obtaining a copy of the
program:

  Q161983 ACC: Regsv32a.exe Available in Download Center

You can use a Visual Basic for Applications procedure to call Regsvr32.exe and
register the MSACCREG.DLL file every time you open the Microsoft Access 97
run-time application. This forces the Microsoft Access file name extensions to
be associated in the Windows registry with the Microsoft Access 7.0 executable
file.

The following sample procedure is designed to run in the Open event of a startup
form. Please note that you may need to insert a loop containing a DoEvents
statement after the line of code that contains the Sendkeys statement; the
purpose of this loop is to delay execution of the Sendkeys statement. Whether or
not you need to implement such a loop depends on the speed of your computer.

Paste or type the following procedure into the Open event of the startup form in
your Microsoft Access 97 run-time application.

NOTE: This code generates an error if Microsoft Access 7.0 is not installed, or
if the file MSACCREG.DLL is not located in the specified folder.

  Private Sub Form_Open(Cancel as Integer)
  Dim ReReg

        ' A message box appears after you run Regsvr32.exe.
        ' The SendKeys statement closes this message box
        ' box by sending it an ENTER key.

        SendKeys "{enter}"

        ' Use the Shell function to run Regsvr32.exe and re-register
        ' the .dll. The pathname argument here assumes that
        ' MSACCREG.DLL is located in the folder C:\Access95.

        ReReg = Shell("Regsvr32.exe C:\Access95\Msaccreg.dll")

  End Sub
