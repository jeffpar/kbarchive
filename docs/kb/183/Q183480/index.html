SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article describes one method to debug an Internet Server API
(ISAPI) Extension or a filter DLL file. (It is assumed that Microsoft Visual C++
is installed on the Internet Information Services (IIS) computer.)

Method to Debug an ISAPI DLL
----------------------------

1. Build a debug version of the ISAPI DLL. By default, the Debug subdirectory of
  the project will now contain *.dll and two files with a *.pdb extension (for
  example, c:\MyProj\debug directory).

2. Create a virtual root with execute permissions in the IIS Management Console,
  and then set its physical location to the project's Debug directory (for
  example, /MyProj virtual root will be mapped to c:\MyProj\Debug).

3. Make sure that W3SVC service is running. Start it if it is not (you can use
  this command: "net start w3svc").

4. Start Microsoft Developer Studio. On the Build menu, click Start Debug, and
  then click Attach Process. Select the Show System Processes option. On a
  Microsoft Windows 2000-based computer, sometimes no processes will appear in
  the process list.

  For additional information about this issue, click the article number below to
  view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q235434 BUG: "Attach to Process" List Is Empty

  To attach a debugger to a particular process, click the "Task Manager
  processes" tab, right-click the process that you want, and then click
  "debug".

5. In the list of running processes, select INETINFO.

6. On the Project menu, click Settings, and then click the Debug tab. In the
  Category list, click Additional DLLs.

  At this point, you should see the message that states that the DLL symbols
  were loaded.

7. Add your ISAPI extension or filter DLL to the list.

8. On the File menu, click Open, and then bring up the source file for the DLL.
  Set a breakpoint in the source code, and then submit a request to IIS from
  the browser (for example, http://&lt;server/myproj/mydll&gt;.dll). If the
  debugger beeps and refuses to set the break point, the reason for this may be
  a mismatch between the DLL and PDB files. Rebuild the DLL to troubleshoot
  this situation.

NOTE: If the application is configured to run out-of-proc in IIS 4.0 (or on IIS
5.0 or IIS 5.1 with an Application Protection setting of medium or high), by
attaching the debugger to Inetinfo.exe, this will not break execution of an
extension DLL. You must attach the debugger to the MTX.exe process (or
Dllhost.exe on a Windows 2000 or Microsoft Windows XP-based system) that hosts
the ISAPI DLL. Because there may be more than one MTX.exe (Dllhost.exe) process
running at one time, you may have to add code to the ISAPI DLL that shows the
process ID (PID) in which the DLL is loaded. After the PID is known, you can
attach the debugger to the MTX (DLLHOST) with the corresponding PID. To do this,
use the following code:

  #define _WIN32_WINNT 0x0400

  #ifdef _DEBUG
  char szMessage [256];
  wsprintf (szMessage, "Please attach a debugger to the process 0x%X (%s) and click OK",
            GetCurrentProcessId(), argv[0]);
  MessageBox(NULL, szMessage, "ISAPI/Filter Debug Time!",
                   MB_OK|MB_SERVICE_NOTIFICATION);
  #endif

Also, note that the Application Protection setting of medium is the default
setting of IIS 5.0.

NOTE: For debugging purposes it may be easier to configure IIS 5.0 or IIS 5.1
applications to run with the Application Protection setting of low. This permits
you to attach the debugger directly to the Inetinfo.exe process.
