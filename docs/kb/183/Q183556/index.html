-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft OLE DB Provider for AS/400 and VSAM, version 1.0, used with:
   - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the path specified for the install directory for SNA Server 4.0 and OLE DB
Provider for AS/400 and VSAM 1.0 is too long, the SNA DDM Service will not start
properly. In one example, the path name specified during installation is 107
bytes long. This is the longest allowed by the installation process. After
rebooting the computer, the following message box appears:

  Title: Service Control Manager
  Text: At least one service or driver failed during system startup. Use
  Event Viewer to examine the event log for details.

The following entry was written to the System event log:

  Event ID: 7022
  Source: Service Control Manager
  Type: Error
  Category: None
  Description: The SNA DDM Service hung on starting.

The following entry was written to the Application event log:

  Event ID: 0
  Source: SNA DDM Service
  Type: Error
  Category: None
  Description: The description for Event ID ( 0 ) in Source ( SNA DDM Service )
  could not be found. It contains the following insertion string(s): DDM Agent
  error: 126, Cannot initialize SNA DDM Service.

When you view the status of the service by opening Control Panel and double-
clicking the Services icon, the status shows that the SNA DDM Service is
started.

WORKAROUND
==========

Uninstall SNA Server 4.0, and then reinstall it with the OLE DB Provider for
AS/400 and VSAM 1.0 using a short install path.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft OLE DB Provider for
AS/400 and VSAM version 1.00 included with SNA Server version 4.0.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
