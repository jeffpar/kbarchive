-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you follow the directions on page 55 of "Microsoft FrontPage 98 Step by
Step," the screen shot on page 56 does not match what you will see on your
screen. The "Morgan Park Zoo" title in the top border is missing, as are the
"Animals" and "Visitor Information" hyperlinks in the left border. Because of
this, the directions on page 56 will not work correctly.

CAUSE
=====

The Lesson 3 Web was created using a prerelease version of Microsoft FrontPage
98. The prerelease version did not correctly save or display Shared Borders.

This error was corrected in the released version of FrontPage. However, because
the Lesson 3 Web was saved in the prerelease version, the Shared Borders is not
displayed properly.

WORKAROUND
==========

Before beginning lesson 3, use the following steps to replace those in the
"Start the lesson" section on page 46.

1. Be certain that the Microsoft FrontPage 98 Step by Step companion CD- ROM is
  in your CD-ROM drive.

2. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click Microsoft FrontPage.

3. Click to select "Create a New FrontPage Web" and click OK.

4. In Section 1, click to select Import An Existing Web.

5. In Section 2, in "Choose A Title For Your FrontPage Web," type "lesson3a"
  (without the quotation marks) and then click OK.

6. In the "Import Web Wizard - Choose Source" dialog box, when asked where you
  want to import the Web from, choose "From A Source Directory Of Files On A
  Local Computer Or Network."

7. Click Browse.

8. Open your CD-ROM drive, open the FrontPage 98 SBS Practice folder, and then
  click the lesson3 folder.

9. Click Next.

10. In the Edit File List dialog box, you should see three files listed:
  Default.htm, Animals.htm, and Visitor.htm. Click Next.

11. Click Finish to build the Web.

12. In FrontPage Explorer, on the Views bar, click Navigation.

13. Scroll down the list of files in the Files pane until the visitor.htm file
  is visible.

14. Drag the visitor.htm file from the Files pane into the Navigation pane, and
  place it below the Morgan Park icon.

15. In the FrontPage Explorer dialog box asking if you want to create navigation
  bars, click No.

16. Scroll down the list of files in the Files pane until the animals.htm file
  is visible.

17. Drag the animals.htm file from the Files pane to the Navigation pane, and
  place it on the left between the Morgan Park and Visitor Information icons.

You should now have a linked group of three pages similar to the structure in the
screenshot on page 39. Note that the icon names will be different from those in
the screen shot.

You are now ready to begin the lesson. The Shared Borders directions will now
work correctly.
