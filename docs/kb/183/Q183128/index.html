SUMMARY
=======

The Attachmate Advanced ISCA SDLC adapter must be configured for legacy mode if
the BIOS on the SNA Server computer does not support Plug and Play. The
resources (IRQ, Memory address, and I/O address) must be configured manually
using the diagnostics disk that ships with the adapter.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Below are the steps to configure the Attachmate Advanced ISCA adapter for legacy
mode. The steps are also listed in the manual that ships with the adapter.

1. Boot to DOS using a DOS-bootable diskette, and run ISCAPNP from the "Advanced
  ISCA Adapter Diagnostic and NWSAA Server Driver" diskette that ships with the
  adapter.

2. The diagnostic program will search for the Advanced ISCA adapter. Because the
  adapter is programmed for Plug and Play mode by default, the following error
  will be displayed: "Adapter not enabled. Adapter is configured for Plug &amp;
  Play mode, but no PnP BIOS is present." Click OK to clear the error.

3. From the Adapter menu, select Configuration Mode. Select Legacy and then
  click OK.

4. Select the I/O, memory, and IRQ settings for the adapter. Click OK.

5. A dialog box will be displayed with the following text: "About to reprogram
  EEPROM. Do you want to continue?" Click Yes. For the changes to take effect,
  restart the PC using the Reset button or by turning the PC of and then back
  on.

6. If the PC does not restart after changing the adapter settings, use the W1
  jumper on the adapter to recover. Turn off the PC, take the card out, and
  disable the settings by placing the W1 jumper on both pins. Install the card
  into the PC again, and repeat the steps above. After the new settings are
  verified, remove the W1 jumper and restart the PC.

7. Next, install the drivers for the adapter. Run SETUP.EXE from the Advanced
  ISCA Adapter SNA Server Driver disk that ships with the adapter. Follow the
  instructions on the screen during setup.

8. Finally, configure the link service and the connection in SNA Server. See the
  online help in SNA Manager for more information.
