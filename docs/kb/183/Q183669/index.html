SUMMARY
=======

This article describes steps for troubleshooting intersite (servers in different
sites) directory replication for Exchange Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Directory replication can take several hours to finish. Even if you have run
Knowledge Consistency Checks, Update Nows, or Request Nows, replication can
still take several hours to fully complete.

If replication is not occurring and enough time has passed that replication
should have occurred, use the following questions to help you determine where
the problem is:

1. What kind of connector (or connectors) is involved?

  Find out what kind of connector is being used between the sites that are
  replicating.

2. Do messages flow across the connector?

  Messages must travel back and forth between the sites in order for replication
  to occur. Try to send a message from the other server, using the X.400
  one-off address of a recipient. If the message does not make it across the
  connection, check the configuration of the connector being used on BOTH
  SIDES. Make sure the connector is set up properly and that messages are
  flowing before you try to get replication working.

3. Are the two sites in the same domain or different domains?

  If the two sites are in the same domain, there should be no problems with
  security; however, please see the next question.

  If the sites are in different domains, there must be a two-way trust between
  the domains. If there is no trust, identical accounts and passwords must be
  used for the Exchange service account. Or, the Override tab must be used if
  the particular connector has an Override tab. Currently, only the RAS
  Connector and the Site Connector have an Override tab.

4. Are the two sites using the same service account?

  In the case of the Site Connector, if the two sites are using different
  service accounts, you must add the service account for each site as a Service
  Account Administrator to each of the respective sites, or you must use the
  Override tab on the Site Connector.

5. What kind of connection exists between the sites?

  Replication can fail if there is not enough bandwidth for the connector being
  used. Be sure to check this whether the sites are connected using Site
  Connectors. Microsoft recommends at the very least a 64-KB link if a Site
  Connector is used with replication.

6. Is there anything in the event log, or are there any other error messages?

  Check the event viewer for any warnings or stop messages pertaining to
  replication. These may help to narrow down the source of the problem. Also
  check the event ID against the Microsoft Knowledge Base. Information found in
  the Knowledge Base may help in resolving the issue.

7. If you have gone through the above steps and everything appears to be set up
  correctly and nothing seems to be a problem, you should turn up Diagnostics
  Logging on the directory and on the MTA of the servers with the problem, in
  the following categories:

     MSExchangeDS        MSExchangeMTA

     Replication         X.400 Service
     ExDS Interface      Interface
     Directory Access    Configuration
                         Directory Access
                         Internal Processing


Change the logging level to Maximum on the above categories on all affected
servers, and then perform a Request Now from the Sites tab of the Replication
Connectors on all affected servers. Information gained from the event logs on
the servers may prove useful in determining the cause of the problem.
