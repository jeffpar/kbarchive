SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses how to use the Microsoft Directory Service Manager for
NetWare (DSMN) to synchronize user accounts between your Windows NT server and
one or more Novell NetWare servers.

With NetWare 2.x and 3.x servers, any changes made to user and/or group accounts
must be made at each individual server. If there are multiple NetWare servers,
changes must be made manually for each of these servers. DSMN allows changes
made to domain user accounts to be replicated automatically to all NetWare
servers being managed by your Windows NT server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

DSMN extends the Windows NT Server directory service features for user and group
account management to NetWare servers. With DSMN, you may centrally manage user
and group accounts that have access to servers running Windows NT Server and
Novell NetWare servers. Each user has a single password to access multiple
servers running either Novell or Windows NT. This password stays synchronized
for all servers.

With DSMN, you can add NetWare servers to be managed with Windows NT Server
domains. A domain is a group of several serves that share a single set of user
and group accounts.

NOTE: DSMN does not require you to install any new software on your NetWare
servers or NetWare clients.

Adding a NetWare Server for Management
--------------------------------------

To add a NetWare server to be managed, use these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click
  Directory Service Manager for NetWare.

2. Select NetWare Server from the list at the top of the dialog box, and then
  select Add Server to Manage from the dropdown menu.

  NOTE: The Select NetWare Server dialog box will then appear containing a list
  of all NetWare servers available.

3. Select a NetWare server to add to the domain.

  NOTE: You must provide a username and password that has NetWare Supervisor or
  Supervisor Equivalency to log on to the NetWare server.

4. Select the user and group accounts for the domain to manage. Any or all user
  and group accounts may be selected.

NOTE: When a NetWare server is added to a domain for management, the NetWare user
and group accounts are moved to the Windows NT domain.

If only some of the users and groups are moved to the domain, choose whether to
delete or retain the remaining users and groups on the NetWare server. If these
accounts are retained, you will need to administer these accounts using NetWare
administrative tools. Do not use NetWare administrative tools, such as Syscon,
on accounts managed by DSMN to prevent those accounts from becoming
unsynchronized with the accounts in the domain.

You may propagate up to 2,000 accounts to the NetWare server. It is suggested
that you choose only the group containing users that actually need access to the
NetWare server. Groups containing users who only use Windows NT server do not
need to be copied. You may modify the list of groups that the Windows NT server
domain propagates to the NetWare server any time after adding the NetWare server
to the domain.

The next time the primary domain controller (PDC) updates its backup domain
controller (BDC), the accounts of all the users and groups copied to the domain
from the NetWare server are replicated to the BDC.

Administering NetWare Servers as Part of a Domain
-------------------------------------------------

After the NetWare server(s) are added for management with a domain and you have
specified NetWare accounts to be maintained by the domain, use User Manager for
Domains to administer those accounts. Changes you make are copied automatically
to the NetWare server(s).

If the NetWare tools are used to modify one of those accounts directly on the
NetWare server, the account will become unsynchronized with the Windows NT
domain. To make the account identical to the version on the PDC, always use User
Manager for Domains to modify the domain account, causing it to be propagated to
the NetWare server(s).

Similarly, to add a new user account to access the NetWare server(s), add it
directly to the domain using User Manager for Domains. You must be certain that
the account is NetWare-enabled. A NetWare-enabled account is an account that can
be propagated from the Windows NT domain to the NetWare server(s) and can log on
from the NetWare client computers. To make an account NetWare-enabled, select
the Maintain NetWare Compatible Login checkbox in the user account properties.
After an account is propagated to the NetWare server, all subsequent changes to
the account are automatically copied to the NetWare server(s).

A NetWare client user must use the Chgpass.exe utility included with DSMN to
change his/her password. The Chgpass.exe utility implements the new password on
all NetWare servers to which the account is propagated, as well as on all
Windows NT domains. Using a NetWare utility to change a password changes it only
on the NetWare servers to which the user is currently attached and the password
becomes unsynchronized with the user's password on the other server(s).

To add NetWare server(s) to domains, specify which Windows NT server group to
propagate to NetWare server(s), and perform all other tasks to administer the
association of NetWare server(s) and Windows NT domains, use the DSMN
Synchronization Manager tool.

NOTE: After adding a NetWare server to a domain, you still use NetWare
administrative tools to manage functions on the NetWare server other than user
account management. This is to include shared volumes, file permissions, trustee
rights, accounting, and printing.

A NetWare server can participate in only one Windows NT domain. Once a NetWare
server has been added for management with a domain, you cannot add it to another
domain without removing it from the first domain.

Adding Multiple NetWare Servers to a Domain
-------------------------------------------

Multiple NetWare servers can be added to a single Windows NT domain. To ensure
good performance, it is recommended that no more than 32 NetWare server be added
to any one Windows NT domain. For performance reasons, if you have more than 32
NetWare servers to add to domains, divide the NetWare servers into smaller
groups and add each group to a different domain.

When dividing NetWare servers into groups, consider what servers need to be used
by the same people. It is best if all the servers used by a particular group of
users are in the same domain. Then you can put that group of servers and users
into a single domain.

When each NetWare server is added, you specify which NetWare users and groups to
transfer from that server to the domain. The security accounts manager (SAM) for
the domain then contains a sum of all the users and groups that you copied from
each NetWare server, plus the users and groups created directly in the Windows
NT domain.

The list of users and groups being propagated may differ for each NetWare server
participating in the domain. If a NetWare user needs access only to a specific
NetWare server(s), then you can propagate the user's account to only those
server(s). This enables you to minimize network traffic, making DSMN more
efficient.

For example, suppose that members of the ACCNT group need access to NetWare
servers NW1 and NW3, while members of SALES need access only to NW1. When you
specify which group to propagate to NW1, you select both ACCNT and SALES. When
you specify the users to propagate to NW3, you select only ACCNT.

How to Handle Identical User Names
----------------------------------

If you add multiple NetWare servers to be managed by the same domain, and each of
those servers has a user or group account with identical names, the accounts are
basically merged into the same account in the domain.

For example, suppose that there is a JOHND account on both the NetWare servers
NW1 and NW3. When NW1 is added for management with the domain, a JOHNC account
is created in the Windows NT domain. Further, that Windows NT account is given
all rights and permissions on NW1 that the JOHNC NetWare account had. Then, when
NW3 is added to the domain, DSMN recognizes that JOHNC already has an account in
the domain, and gives the account the rights and permissions of the NW3 JOHND
account. The domain's JOHND account then has all rights and permissions that
were previously assigned to both the NW1 and NW3 JOHND accounts.

DSMN can also merge user accounts on multiple NetWare servers into a single
account in the domain, with all the rights previously held by both accounts. For
example, if JOHND also has an account on another server with a user name of
JOHNDOE, you can merge this account into the domain's JOHND account, which would
then have all rights previously held by both JOHND and JOHNDOE.

NOTE: If there is an account on a NetWare server that has the same name as an
account already existing in the Windows NT domain, the rights and permissions of
the NetWare account are given to the existing Windows NT server account. If the
existing Windows NT server account is NetWare- enabled, the account is given a
new password to enable it to be propagated to NetWare servers.

How NetWare Servers are Kept Synchronized
-----------------------------------------

When DSMN is installed in a domain, an account synchronization database is
created on the PDC. This information stores the following pieces of
information:

- The users and groups being propagated to each NetWare server in the domain.

- The update status of all user and group accounts on each NetWare server.

The update status of an account states which account modifications made to the
account have been copied to the appropriate NetWare server(s). If the account is
copied to more than one server, the update status may be different on each
server.

Whenever an account on the Windows NT domain is modified, DSMN detects the
change, updates the account synchronized database, and attempts to send the
change to all NetWare servers to which this account is propagated. This attempt
will succeed for all NetWare servers that are currently running.

If a NetWare server is not running, it will be updated later. The account
synchronization database keeps track of what account updates are still needed at
each NetWare server. When the account is updated on a NetWare server, only the
changed information is sent over the network to minimize network traffic.

Using DSMN in an Enterprise
---------------------------

If you have a trusted domain structure using the master domain model and you have
32 or fewer NetWare servers to add to domains, consider adding all servers to
the master domain. The accounts from the NetWare servers will be in the same
domain as your other accounts, simplifying account management.

DSMN does not operate across domains. A user can be propagated only to NetWare
serves that have been added to the domain that contains the user's account.
