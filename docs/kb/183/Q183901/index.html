-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When your Domain Name Service (DNS) starts on your computer running Windows NT
Server, you may receive the following error:

  Could not start the Microsoft DNS Server service &lt;server name&gt;.
  Error 1068: The dependency service or group failed to start.

Event Viewer on your DNS server may also log one or more of the following event
messages in the System log:

  Event ID   : 7001
  Source     : ServiceControlManager
  Description: The Microsoft DNS Server service depends on the WINS Client
               (TCP/IP) service which failed to start because of the
               following error: A device attached to the system is not
               functioning.

-or-

  Event ID   : 7000
  Source     : ServiceControlManager
  Description: The WINS Client(TCP/IP) service failed to start due to the
               following error: A device attached to the system is not
               functioning.

-or-

  Event ID   : 4315
  Source     : NetBT
  Description: Unable to read the driver's exported linkage configuration
               information.

CAUSE
=====

The DNS service will not start because the Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)
client is not bound to a network interface card in that computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use one of the following methods:

- Verify that the WINS client is bound to at least one network interface card
  (NIC) on your server:

  1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and double- click
     Network.

  2. Click the Bindings tab and double-click NetBIOS Interface to expand it.

  3. Double-click WINS Client (TCP/IP) to expand it.

  4. Verify that at least one of the adapters listed is enabled.

  NOTE: If you need to ensure that all NetBIOS traffic is removed from the
  network while still using Microsoft DNS, you can install the MS Loopback
  Adapter and have the WINS Client bound to it.

  -or-

- Disable the NetBT dependency from DNS in the registry:

  WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
  require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee
  that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be
  solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
  Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
  Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
  Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.
  If you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair
  Disk (ERD).

  1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

  2. Go to the following subkey:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DNS

  3. Click the DependOnService value.

  4. On the Edit menu, click Multi String and then delete NetBT from the data.

  5. Click OK.

  6. Close Registry Editor and restart your computer.

  NOTE: If you are using WINS reverse look up on any zones the DNS server will
  fail to start.
