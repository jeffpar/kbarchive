The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A system that is running the SNA Host Account Cache (User Credential Database)
service that is included with Host Integration Server (HIS) 2000 may log the
following event in the Application Event Log:

  Event ID: 1339
  Source: SNA Host Security
  Description: The request database access is denied for the client account:
  NTAUTHORITY\\SYSTEM

NOTE: The event description may only contain two backslashes (\\) for the client
account.

In this case, the Event 1339 is benign and does not cause any problems with host
security functionality.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows Management Instrumentation (WinMgmt.exe) service causes the SNA
Manage Agent (MngAgent.exe) service to send a UDI_GET_VALID_DOMS_NT request to
the SNA Host Account Cache database under some circumstances.

WinMgmt.exe runs under the local system account and this account cannot be
authenticated by the Host Account Cache database. The failure to authenticate
this account results in the Event 1339 being logged in the Application Event
Log.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Host Integration
Server 2000.


MORE INFORMATION
================

If HIS 2000 and the HIS 2000 clients are configured to use Active Directory, HIS
2000 clients will use WMI calls to retrieve specific configuration information
from HIS 2000 servers. For example, a client that is running a 3270 emulator
will make a WMI call to determine what 3270 LUs are assigned to the user who is
making the request.

If host security is being used, these WMI calls may result in a
UDI_GET_VALID_DOMS_NT call being sent to the Host Account Cache database by
MngAgent.exe on the behalf of WinMgmt.exe.

The following are two scenarios that appear to generate the Event 1339 messages:

- Running the 3270 client.

- Running the 5250 client and then on the Session menu, clicking Session
  Configuration to select a remote APPC LU alias.
