-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server 
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are migrating users from Lotus Notes R4.6, or R5 to Exchange Server
5.5, or Exchange 2000 Server where meetings are present in the Lotus Notes
calendar that contain backslashes in either the Subject, or Description fields,
the backslashes appear to double in quantity in the Outlook Calendar after you
migrate this user to Exchange.

For example, before the migration, in the Lotus Notes calendar, a meeting exists
with the description of:

  Connect to \\server\share\file ...

After the migration, when you view this meeting in the Outlook calendar, the
description appears as:

  Connect to \\\\server\\share\\file ...

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5
and Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you complete the migration process, the Microsoft Exchange Migration
Wizard generates a message that contains an .sc2 file attachment, which has the
subject Migrated Calendar Information. You have to import this file into Outlook
in order to populate the Outlook Calendar with the calendar information from
Lotus Notes.

In the .sc2 file, the backslashes double even before you import this file into
Outlook.

Here is a sample of an .sc2 file that contains backslashes that have doubled:

  SingleAppointments:
  {
	Start: 09-22-2000 13:15
	End:   09-22-2000 14:15
	Text:  "backslash test 2 \\\\  "\\\\""
