  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install the Systems Management Server (SMS) Administrator console, on a
secondary site server, you can prevent successful hotfix installations on that
secondary site server.

You will see lines in the installation log for the hotfix, similar to the
following example:

  *** Installation Started 9/8/00 9:29:28 ***
  Title: Service Update
  Source: \\scfsms1\hotfix\Q252717\Q252717.EXE
  File Overwrite: E:\SMS\LOGS\Q252717r.txt
  File Overwrite: E:\SMS\LOGS\Q252717p.txt
  File Overwrite: E:\SMS\LOGS\Q252717q.txt
  User Rights: Admin

The text files get updated, but the hotfix binaries do not.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the installation of the Systems Management Server
Administrator console changes a registry value critical to the hotfix
application. This registry key is:

  HKLM/SOFTWARE/MICROSOFT/SMS/SETUP/TYPE

The Type value should be either 0x1 for a primary Site, or 0x2 for a secondary
site. The Administrator console installation process on a secondary site may
change this to a greater value, such as 0x6. The hotfix installation checks the
Type value for a value of 0x1 (primary site), or 0x2 (secondary site), to verify
that the installation is occurring on a site server. Because the value has been
modified to a greater value, the installation fails.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

You can resolve this problem by changing the value back to the correct value of
2, and then running the hotfix application again.

Note: This behavior does not occur with the SMS Service Pack 2 hotfixes.
