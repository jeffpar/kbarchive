SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to change the replication schedule of the Address
Book view Naming Context so that it never replicates automatically.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Using the raw mode of the Exchange Server Administrator program (admin
/r) incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall
Microsoft Windows NT Server and/or Microsoft Exchange Server. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of raw mode can be
solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.

To modify the replication schedule of the Address Book view container:

1. Type the following command at a command prompt to start the Microsoft
  Exchange Server Administrator program in raw mode:

  "c:\exchsrvr\bin\admin /r" (without the quotation marks)

2. Click the Address Book view container, and then click Raw Properties on the
  File menu.

3. Click the General tab, and then click the Period-Rep-Synch-Times attribute
  from the Object attributes list.

4. Click Editor, and then click Schedule.

5. Click the Schedule tab, clear the entire schedule, and then click OK.

6. Click Set to commit the changes, and then click OK.

If you use this procedure to prevent Address Book view replication, you may
experience unexpected behavior. If replication occurred with multiple sites, the
following issues may occur:

- Multiple Address Book views

- Address Book view storms

- Orphaned Address Book views

If you follow this procedure, replication is not prevented if you manually force
replication. Replication is forced when you click the Update Now button on the
server's Directory Service object. When you do so, the schedule is bypassed
completely, and the Address Book view Naming Context is requested.

If you created an Address Book view for each site in an Exchange Server
organization, and you configure the Address Book view to prevent replication,
after one Directory Replication cycle, you see as many Address Book views as you
have sites. This behavior can cause high Dsamain.exe central processing unit
(CPU) symptoms at those sites.

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q251054 High Dsmain.exe CPU Usage When Populating Address Book Views

Instead of using the Update Now button to manually force replication, it is
recommended that you change the schedule to Always for a short time and wait up
to 15 minutes for replication to occur.
