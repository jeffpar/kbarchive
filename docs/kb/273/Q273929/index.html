The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Crimson Skies 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you host or join a game of Microsoft Crimson Skies on the MSN Gaming Zone and
then start Crimson Skies to create a custom aircraft while you wait for other
players to join the game, you receive a dialog box stating that the game is
starting when the host starts the game on the Zone.

However, the game may not start on your computer.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Zone is unable to start the game on your
computer if Crimson Skies is already running.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this problem from occurring, quit Crimson Skies before you attempt to
host or join a game of Crimson Skies game on the Zone, and do not start Crimson
Skies while you are waiting for the host to start a game of Crimson Skies on the
Zone.

If you want to fly a custom aircraft in a game of Crimson Skies on the Zone,
create and save the aircraft in Crimson Skies, and then quit Crimson Skies
before you attempt to host or join a game on the Zone.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Crimson Skies.
