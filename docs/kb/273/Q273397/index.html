SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the enhancements and fixes that are included in the Age
of Empires II: The Age of Kings Update 2.0a for Microsoft Age of Empires II: The
Age of Kings.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The enhancements and fixes included with the Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings
Update 2.0a are:

- Single-Player Performance Improvements - The performance of single-player
  campaign games has been improved, especially on computers that contain slower
  processors.

- Limited Pauses - The total number of pauses available to each player in a
  multiplayer game is limited. The total number of pauses remaining is
  displayed each time someone pauses the game.

- Display Name of Out of Sync Player - In a multiplayer game with three or more
  players, if a player's computer becomes out of sync, that player's name is
  displayed in an out of sync message on all the other player's computers.

- Stability Improvements - A number of hanging and multiplayer out of sync
  problems are fixed, which results in improved game stability.

- Computer Player Does Not Resign - The computer player no longer resigns after
  a few minutes of play. (Previously available in the AI Update.)

- Fish Trap - You cannot build a Fish Trap on top of an existing fish resource.

- Fishing Ship - You cannot use a Fishing Ship to construct buildings other
  than a Fish Trap.

- Flare and Waypoint - The game does not stop responding (hang) when you set a
  flare or waypoint location at the very Southern-most point on the map.

- Cooperative Farming - When you take over a farm foundation that was built by
  an ally, you cannot extract more than the standard amount of food from that
  farm.

- Farming on Forest - You cannot build a Farm or Wall on top of a partially cut
  section of forest.

- Unit Ignoring Orders - Units do not ignore orders under some circumstances.

- Multiplayer Restore from Zone - The ability to save and restore a
  disconnected or out-of-sync multiplayer game on Zone.com has been improved.

- Foundation Outline - Building foundations now have outlines, so you can click
  them when they are behind trees or other objects.

- Trebuchet Firing - Trebuchets do not miss targets that are at a different
  elevation.

- Single-Player Campaign After Regicide - A single-player game does not
  automatically end immediately after you play a multiplayer game of Regicide.

- Computer Player - The behavior of the computer player in multiplayer games
  has been improved.

- Scenario Editor - A number of Scenario Editor problems have been fixed.
