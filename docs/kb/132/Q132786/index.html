SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience one or more of the following problems with Microsoft Print
Agent for NetWare Networks (MSPSRV):

Wrong Font Size Used on Print Server Tab in Printer Properties
--------------------------------------------------------------

When you click the Print Server tab in the Printer Properties dialog box, the
text extends beyond the border of the dialog box. The dialog box is still
usable.

Error Message: Could Not Enumerate Print Servers on this Server
---------------------------------------------------------------

When you click "Enable Microsoft Print Server for NetWare," you receive the
following error message:

  Could not enumerate print servers on this server.

When you receive this error message, you are automatically logged off the NetWare
server and your NetWare connections are lost. You must restart Windows 95 and
log on again to restore your connections.


Cannot Activate Print Server List Box
-------------------------------------

In order to activate the Print Server list box, you must click the NetWare Server
list box and then click your NetWare server. You must do this even if the
appropriate NetWare server appears in the box.

Preferred Server Listed Twice in Network Neighborhood
-----------------------------------------------------

MSPSRV causes the server on which the print queue resides to appear in Network
Neighborhood. If this is also your preferred server, you may see it listed in
Network Neighborhood twice.

You are Prompted for Password to NetWare Server
-----------------------------------------------

Each time you access a NetWare server, you are asked for the password. This
occurs even when you are already logged on to the NetWare server.


Lost Connection to NetWare Server When Printing
-----------------------------------------------

If MSPSRV is enabled and you send multiple print jobs to a NetWare print server,
you lose the connection to the NetWare server.


Wrong Form Printed
------------------

All print jobs sent to a NetWare server print queue revert to form zero, even if
a different form number or name is used.

For additional information about this problem, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q148904 NetWare Print Jobs Always Use Form Zero


Must Restart Computer After Enabling or Disabling MSPSRV
--------------------------------------------------------

After you enable or disable MSPSRV, you must restart your computer.


Not All NetWare Print Servers Enumerated
----------------------------------------

A Windows 95-based workstation with MSPSRV enabled may not enumerate all of the
NetWare print servers on the list.
