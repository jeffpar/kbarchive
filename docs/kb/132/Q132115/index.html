The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you re-install or upgrade the copy of Windows 95 on a Micro Channel
Architecture (MCA) computer, one or more installed devices may be listed twice
in Device Manager.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you install a device manually using the Add New
Hardware Wizard before you re-install or upgrade Windows 95. During Setup, a
hardware detection routine runs to determine what devices are installed in the
computer. On MCA computers, the hardware detection routine cannot determine
which devices were already installed in Device Manager if the devices were
installed manually.


RESOLUTION
==========

To remove a duplicate device in Device Manager, follow these steps:

1. Use the right mouse button to click My Computer, then click Properties on the
  menu that appears.

2. Click the Device Manager tab.

3. Click the device, then click Remove. Note that you may need to expand a
  branch of the hardware tree by double-clicking the branch, or by clicking the
  plus sign (+) to the left of the branch, before you can click the device.

4. Click OK.

To prevent this problem from occurring, install a new device manually only if it
is not automatically detected by the Add New Hardware Wizard. To use the Add New
Hardware Wizard to automatically detect and install all new devices, follow
these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Add New Hardware icon.

3. Click Next.

4. Verify that the Yes (Recommended) option button is selected, then click Next.

5. Click Next.

STATUS

Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
