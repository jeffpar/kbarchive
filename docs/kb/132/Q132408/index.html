The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Gateway to SNADS, versions 2.1, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Unlike other Microsoft Mail gateway products, the Microsoft Mail Gateway to
SNADS does not have a remove gateway parameter on the install program (for
example, install -r). Because SNADS routing is maintained in a similar format to
Microsoft Mail routing, routes can be managed directly through the
Administrator's program (ADMIN.EXE).

Therefore, to remove a SNADS Gateway definition, use ADMIN.EXE to select
Gateways, SNADS, DGNs, Delete and to delete each DGN. After you delete the DGNs,
delete the Gateway in ADMIN.EXE by selecting Gateways, SNADS, Gateways, Delete.

NOTE: Always delete the DGNs before deleting the gateway. If there are many DGNs
and/or large DGNs, you will get a "insufficient memory" error from ADMIN.EXE
when you try to delete the gateway.

Also, If there are downstream postoffices (POs) communicating with a SNADS user,
remove the farthest downstream PO first, and work toward the Gateway PO. This
will avoid "Hub Bit" errors generated when you try to delete a gateway from a
forwarding PO.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the DGNs contain several hundred DENs, you may delete DENs by running
IMPORT.EXE. The syntax of Import is as follows:

  Import -r -gsnads -f&lt;filename&gt;.

This will remove all addresses of type SNADS and replace it with the list in file
-f&lt;filename&gt;. This import file will not remove DGNs as there needs to be
at least one Add Entry for each DGN in this file. This will make the process of
deleting DGNs go much faster as ADMIN.EXE reads all entries into memory before
deleting them.

For more information about Import, refer to Appendix A in the Microsoft Mail
"Administrator's Guide."
