NASCAR Racing makes incorrect assumptions about the system memory configuration
when Windows 95 is running, causing it to believe the computer has a negative
amount of memory. It must be run in MS-DOS mode.

It may be necessary to delete the existing NASCAR.PIF file before running this
program, so that Windows can configure it properly.

NOTE: The 1.2 patch of NASCAR.EXE runs in Windows 95, with some reservations:

- If this is the first MS-DOS-based program that uses the sound card after the
  system is restarted, it hangs the system.

- If this is the second MS-DOS-based program that uses the sound card, it works
  correctly.

- With this patch, the program works properly at any time if the sound card is
  disabled in Device Manager.

data structures. It must be run in MS-DOS mode.

protection terminates the program due to an invalid operation. Run One Must Fall
in MS-DOS mode to avoid the problem.

One Must Fall comes with a custom .PIF file called OMF.PIF that you must delete
before running One Must Fall. This allows Windows 95 to create a new OMF.PIF
file that is properly configured.

-----------------------------------------------------

Putt-Putt Joins the Parade requires MS-DOS mode.

Quarantine by GameTek
---------------------

Executable: Q.BAT

Quarantine programs the sound card to a rate faster than it can handle. It must
be run in MS-DOS mode.

Running an Application in MS-DOS Mode
-------------------------------------

Windows 95 usually runs programs that require MS-DOS mode in MS-DOS mode
automatically. If it does not, delete the corresponding .PIF file and
double-click the program icon again. Note that .PIF files usually have the same
name as the program file, but with a .PIF extension instead of the .BAT, .COM,
or .EXE extension. The corresponding .PIF file can be found in one of the
following locations:

- In the folder that contains the program file.

- In the hidden PIF folder in the Windows 95 folder.

- In a folder specified by your PATH statement.

To make certain you find all copies of the .PIF file, use the Find Files Or
Folders feature.

If Windows 95 does not configure the program to run in MS-DOS mode automatically,
follow these steps:

1. Click the executable file with the right mouse button, then click Properties
  on the menu that appears.

2. On the Program tab, click the Advanced button.

3. Click the MS-DOS Mode check box to select it.

4. You can usually use the Use Current MS-DOS Configuration option. However,
  some programs may require that you use the Specify A New Configuration
  option. Consult the program's documentation for sample CONFIG.SYS and
  AUTOEXEC.BAT files.

5. Click OK.

These steps cause the program to run in MS-DOS mode. You may need to optimize the
settings if the program requires a mouse, expanded memory, a CD-ROM drive, or a
sound card. Consult the program's documentation to determine if it has specific
needs.

NOTE: You may have to double-click the program icon in Windows Explorer or My
Computer, or type the program name in the Run dialog box, for the program's
settings to take effect. Typing the program name at an MS-DOS prompt does not
always cause the program's settings to be used.
