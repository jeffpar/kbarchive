SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft provides a replacement for the MSRMTCN.DLL file that is included with
version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows.

For complete information about obtaining and installing the MSRMTCN.DLL file, see
the following sections:

- To download the updated file

- To update your MSRMTCN.DLL file

MORE INFORMATION
================

This update contains the MSRMTCN.DLL file, a replacement for the MSRMTCN.DLL
file that is included with versions 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows.
This replacement file provides additional enhancements to the original
MSRMTCN.DLL file, correcting the following problems:

- A message remaining in the Outbox could be misdirected if the remote address
  book was updated without uploading messages. The client will now check for
  the outbound messages prior to updating the address book. To ensure this fix
  works correctly, the following DLLs must be upgraded in conjunction with this
  DLL:

     MSRMT.DLL   v3.2.4013
     MSRMTSU.DLL v 3.2.4013
     MSRMTTR.DLL v3.2.4013
     MSRMTUI.DLL  v3.2.4013

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

After you download MSRMTCN.EXE to a clean directory, run it (by typing "msrmtcn"
(without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt) to extract the
contents of the file. You should receive the following files:

  MSRMTCN.DLL (23,776 bytes, dated 6-15-95, 6:04 P.M.)
  README.TXT

To update your MSRMTCN.DLL file
-------------------------------

1. Verify that the Microsoft Mail Remote driver (MSRMT.DLL) is the current
  driver in the Mail System Selector (MAILDRV.EXE) by running the Mail System
  Selector from the Windows Program Manager, choosing Microsoft Mail Remote,
  and then selecting Set As Current Mail Driver.

2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

  " copy &lt;drive&gt;:\msrmtcn.dll &lt;destination&gt; " (without the
  quotation marks)

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive and directory where you ran the self
  extracting MSRMTCN.EXE file and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and
  directory where your MSRMTCN.DLL file currently resides. For example, if you
  ran the self-extracting file from the TEST directory on drive D, and your
  MSRMTCN.DLL is located in the Windows SYSTEM directory on drive C, type the
  following command:

  " copy d:\test\msrmtcn.dll c:\windows\system " (without the quotation marks)
