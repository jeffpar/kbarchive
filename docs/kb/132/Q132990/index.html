SYMPTOMS
========

The estimated compression ratio on the Compression tab in Drive properties
remains at 1.0:1 despite changes to the estimated compression ratio in
DriveSpace 3.

If you try to change the estimated ratio for the drive, you receive the following
error message:

  Due to your current system configuration, your changes will have no effect on
  the amount of free disk space that Windows reports.

  DriveSpace is currently configured for optimum speed. With this configuration,
  DriveSpace does not use compression when saving changes to your files.
  Because of this, Windows uses a 1:1 estimated compression ratio to calculate
  free space, regardless of the setting in the compression ratio dialog box. Do
  you want to change the ratio anyway?

CAUSE
=====

Compression Agent has been set to maximize performance. This is reflected in the
following two Compression Methods settings:

- The "Which files do you want to UltraPack?" setting is set to "Do not
  UltraPack any files (maximum performance)."

- The "Do you want to HiPack the rest of your files?" setting is set to "No,
  store them uncompressed (maximum performance)."

RESOLUTION
==========

If you want to compress files, change the Compression Methods settings to the
HiPack values. For maximum performance, however, leave the settings as they are.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the maximum performance settings are used, all files are uncompressed to a
1.0:1 ratio after Compression Agent is run. This prevents the estimated
compression ratio from changing in the drive's properties.

When DriveSpace is set to High Performance in the performance tuning dialog,
DriveSpace turns off on-line compression. To have the changes made to the ECR
take effect, you must enable on-line compression.
