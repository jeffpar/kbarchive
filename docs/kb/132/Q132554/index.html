SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows NT 3.5 Server Pack 2 or Windows NT 3.51, your
asynchronous Digiboard PC/XEM micro channel adapter stops working. The following
messages are written to the event log:

  Source: SCM
  Event ID: 7000
  Description: Digi fep 5 driver service failed to start due to the following
  error:

  No mapping between account names and security id's was done.

  Source: DIGIFEP5
  Event ID: 5
  Description: The description for event id %5% in source digifep5 could not be
  located. It contains the following insertion string(s),NTXEM2.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT does not correctly save the slot number in the registry on MCA
computers. The slot number is incorrectly saved as 0.

Also, the Digiboard driver downloads its configuration information to the board
during initialization. If the computer is not cold booted (turned off) between
configuration changes, the driver will not reinitialize the board on the next
boot.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE) and modify the
following key in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive to manually change the slot
number:

  \System\CurrentControlSet\Services\NTXEM2\Parameters\Slot Number

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. If you have already installed the Digiboard driver, unistall it and reboot
  (cold boot) the computer.

2. Use the Microchannel Reference floppy disk that was supplied with the
  computer to confirm that the Digiboard has been configured properly and the
  reboot (cold boot) the computer.

3. Boot Windows NT and install the Digiboard driver. Do not reboot the computer.

4. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

5. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:


     SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NTXALL[1-n]\Parameters


6. Change the value for SlotNumber to the correct slot number.

7. Run Control Panel, choose Network, and configure the Digiboard. The correct
  slot number will appear and Setup will reconfigure the other values
  correctly. Quit Control Panel, but choose not to reboot the computer.

8. Shutdown the computer and then reboot (cold boot) it again:

  a. From the Program Manager File menu choose Shutdown.

  b. Choose Shutdown and then choose OK.

  This allows any configuration currently saved in the Digiboard to be cleared,
  allowing Windows NT to reinitialize it during the next boot process.


STATUS
======
