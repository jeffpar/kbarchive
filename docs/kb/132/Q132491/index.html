-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax, version 3.0.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Version 3.0.1 of Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax can experience a critical error
that halts the program. The critical error may be caused by a corrupt RRS.FAX
file. The gateway screen will show the following message:

  A Critical error has occurred (10:0:2:0)

  Attempted operation: CREATE File affected: M:\FAX\RRS.FAX

On the first attempt to restart the gateway, the following messages may occur:

  A Critical error has occurred (10:0:2:0)

  Database function failure

A second attempt to restart results in the following message:

  [&lt;time&gt;] - RRS.FAX file is corrupted

  [&lt;time&gt;] - &gt;&gt;&gt; Press any key to shutdown

CAUSE
=====

The errors mentioned above are the result of a corrupt RRS.FAX file.

The RRS.FAX file can be corrupted under the following circumstances:

- A fax message is sent with a bad phone number.

- No other valid recipients are in the message.

- The faxout cycle begins with more than one mail item in the fax queue.

- The bad message follows a good message.

The corruption is due to a failure in resetting a pointer in the RRS.FAX file.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem.

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information on support costs, please go to the following address on the World
Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  File Name    Version
  --------------------
  Faxgtw.exe   3.0.2

This hotfix has been posted to the following Internet location as Faxgy2k.exe:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/mail/gateways-public/All-Y2K/


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax
version 3.0.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After the sequence of events mentioned in the "Symptoms" section above, it is
not possible to compress the RRS.FAX file. It has been renamed to TMPRRS.FAX,
and it still contains the corruption.

To recover, restore the RRS.FAX file from the installation disk. The initial
RRS.FAX file is four 00 bytes. When the RRS.FAX file is reset, the messages in
the FAX queue should be returned or deleted using the Microsoft Mail
Administrator's program (ADMIN.EXE).

Additional query words: 3.00.1
