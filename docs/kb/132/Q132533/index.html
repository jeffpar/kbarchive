-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Form.Grid.AddColumn() method allows you to add a column at run time to the
grid, and have that column visually inserted between two existing columns. If
the Form.SaveAs method is then used to save the form, and the form is modified
by using the Form Designer, the newly inserted column appears at the end of the
list of columns.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. The ColumnOrder property of the new column is set to one more
than the current number of grid columns. When the form is saved and reopened,
the ColumnOrder property affects the display order of the columns in the grid.

RESOLUTION
==========

After adding a column through the AddColumn() method, set the ColumnOrder
property of the new column prior to saving the form. The preexisting columns
will have their ColumnOrder property incremented by one so that they are
properly displayed when the form is reopened.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form in the Form Designer. Add the Customer and Orders tables
  from \VFP\SAMPLES\MAINSAMP\DATA\TASTRADE.DBC database to the data environment
  of the form.

2. Drag the Cust_id field from the Customer table to the form. Drag the Orders
  table to the form.

3. Set the following grid properties:

     Grid1.ColumnCount = 2
     Grid1.Column1.ControlSource = Orders.Order_id
     Grid1.Column2.ControlSource = Orders.Order_date

4. Save the form as frmGrid, and run the form.

5. Issue the following commands in the Command window:

     frmGrid.Grid1.AddColumn(2)
     frmGrid.Grid1.Column3.Header1.Caption = "New"
     frmGrid.SaveAs("frmNew")

6. Note the position of the column with the header of [ASCII 147]New." Close the
  instance of frmGrid and open frmNew in the Form Designer.

7. Notice that the column with the New header, which appeared as the second
  column when the form was running, now appears as the third column of the grid
  in the Form Designer.

Example Resolution
------------------

To resolve the problem, insert the following line of code prior to the
frmGrid.SaveAs() line in step 5:

     frmGrid.Grid1.Column3.ColumnOrder = 2
