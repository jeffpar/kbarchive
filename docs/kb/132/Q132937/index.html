The information in this article applies to:

- The Microsoft Network versions 1.0, 1.05, 1.2, 1.3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses known issues concerning upgrades to The Microsoft Network
software on your computer. For information about how the upgrade process works,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q131244 How the Component Manager for The Microsoft Network Works

MORE INFORMATION
================

Unused Files and Temp Folder Not Deleted
----------------------------------------

When The Microsoft Network performs an upgrade that causes files to no longer be
needed to run The Microsoft Network, these files are not deleted from your
computer.

During the upgrade process, The Microsoft Network temporarily places files in the
Program Files\The Microsoft Network\Temp folder and its folders. The Temp folder
is not deleted after the files are removed.

If you delete any files from the Temp folder before restarting Windows 95, the
upgrade fails. However, you receive no notification of this failure.


Upgrade Version Number
----------------------

When The Microsoft Network performs an upgrade, it does not display the version
number of the upgrade.

The version number shown on the About The Microsoft Network screen is the version
of the shell, not of the upgrade.


Partial Upgrade Not Recognized
------------------------------

If you start an upgrade then cancel it, the next time you start the upgrade, the
entire upgrade is performed. That is, already upgraded files are not
recognized.


SPACEBAR Invokes Cancel
-----------------------

If you press the SPACEBAR during an upgrade, a dialog box appears asking if you
want to cancel the upgrade.


Download Status Bar
-------------------

The download status bar may show that the upgrade is finished before it actually
is. The status bar may sometimes progress very slowly or appear not to be
progressing during long upgrades.


Two Dialog Boxes
----------------

If you receive an upgrade of The Microsoft Network, then try to sign in without
first restarting Windows 95, you receive the following two dialog boxes:

- A message stating that you must restart.

- A message stating that the service is not available.

You must restart Windows 95 after receiving an upgrade of The Microsoft Network.
