-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry  Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to import the registry using Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) in real
mode, you may receive either of the following error messages:

- Unable to open registry (14) - System.dat

- Error accessing the registry: The file may not be complete.

CAUSE
=====

The real-mode stub of Regedit.exe has the ability to export, import, and create
registry files. Regedit.exe uses the internal real-mode registry library to
accomplish these tasks. The real-mode code in this library has certain problems
with large registry files.

For example, if there are many applications installed, HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT may be
quite large. If one of the structures in the System.dat file takes up too much
space in conventional memory, the registry cannot be accessed.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To work around this problem, use Registry Editor in protected mode.

For information about how to import the registry, view the "Importing the
Registry" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
