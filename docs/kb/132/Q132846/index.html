SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Rodney's Funscreen by ActiVision, it asks you to insert disk 1
even though disk 1 is already in the disk drive. After following the
instructions, Rodney's Funscreen is not completely installed.

CAUSE
=====

The Setup program for Rodney's Funscreen is in two parts: a Windows part, and an
MS-DOS part. When it is time to install the MS-DOS part, Rodney's Funscreen
starts the MS-DOS program but does not wait long enough for the MS-DOS part to
finish before trying to continue with the Windows part. Rodney's Funscreen
thinks that the MS-DOS part (which involves removing disk 1) is finished, when
in fact it has not yet started. The Setup program then allows you to continue
through the rest of the setup procedure without ever finishing the MS-DOS part
of the installation.

RESOLUTION
==========

To install Rodney's Funscreen successfully, follow these steps:

1. Quit all programs that are running.

2. Restart the Setup program.

3. When the Windows part of the installation prompts you to insert disk 1,
  switch to the MS-DOS part of the installation and follow the instructions. To
  switch to the MS-DOS part of the setup, press ALT+TAB or click the MS-DOS
  button on the taskbar.

4. When the MS-DOS part of the installation is finished, switch back to the
  Windows part, click the OK button in the message box prompting you to
  reinsert disk 1, and continue with the installation procedure as before.

If you continue to have problems running or installing Rodney's Funscreen, please
contact ActiVision.
