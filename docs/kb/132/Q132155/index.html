- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows NT 3.5 Service Pack 2, one or all of the following
error messages appear when you attempt to start Sybase SQLServer Services with a
user account that has the "Log on as a service" user right:

  Stop: Could not start the Sybase SQLServer_COMPUTERNAME service on
  \\COMPUTERNAME.

  Error 0002: The system cannot find the file specified.

  Stop: Could not start the Sybase MONServer_COMPUTERNAME_MS service on
  \\COMPUTERNAME.

  Error 0002: The system cannot find the file specified.

  Stop: Could not start the Sybase BCKServer_COMPUTERNAME_BS service on
  \\COMPUTERNAME.

  Error 0002: The system cannot find the file specified.

The following events may appear in the system log:

  Event ID: 7000
  Source: Service Control Manager
  Type: Error
  Description: The Sybase SQLServer_COMPUTERNAME service failed to start
  due to the following error: The system cannot find the file specified.

  Event ID: 7000
  Source: Service Control Manager
  Type: Error
  Description: The Sybase SQLServer_COMPUTERNAME_MS service failed to
  start due to the following error: The system cannot find the file specified.

  Event ID: 7000
  Source: Service Control Manager
  Type: Error
  Description: The Sybase SQLServer_COMPUTERNAME_BS service failed to
  start due to the following error: The system cannot find the file specified.

CAUSE
=====

If the command string for a service contains multiple words, and the service
logs on under an account other than LocalSystem, the service controller does not
parse the command line correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, do one of the following:

- Install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.5.

- Restore Sybase SQLServer services startup options to log on as the System
  Account.

- Restore SERVICES.EXE from the original Windows NT 3.5 CD-ROM or floppy disks.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. This
problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.5. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
