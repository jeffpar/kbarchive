-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In versions 1.0 and 1.0a of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, the following error
will be displayed when a user's offline calendar file password does not match
the online version of the calendar file maintained on the server in the CAL
directory.

  Your passwords don't match. Type your old password.

CAUSE
=====

This error message will be displayed when one of the following situations
occurs:

1. The user changed his or her password under Microsoft Mail for Windows.

2. The Mail Administrator has recovered the user's password using the ADMIN.EXE
  program from versions 3.0 and 3.0a of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you are on a version 3.0 or 3.0a Mail for the PC Networks postoffice, the
ADMIN.EXE program that shipped with these versions did not recover the password
for the user's \MAILDATA\CAL\HEXID.CAL file. You must obtain the latest
ADMIN.EXE file for version 3.2 of Mail for PC Networks.

This problem was corrected in ADMIN.EXE version 3.2. If you do not have version
3.2 (or later), the following self-extracting file is available for download
from the Microsoft Software Library:

  Admin.exe (http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/Admin.exe)

For more information about downloading files from the Microsoft Software Library,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q107443 PC Adm: Microsoft Mail ADMIN.EXE 3.2.17 Update

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following procedures are required when you recover calendar file passwords.
Please read all procedures prior to performing them.

1. Rename the user's local calendar file to USERNAME.BAK. The location of this
  file is defined in the SCHDPLUS.INI file's 'LocalPath=' parameter.

  NOTE:: If you are already recovered the user's password running ADMIN.EXE
  version 3.2x, go to step 4.

2. Launch ADMIN.EXE version 3.2x against the postoffice the user resides on.

3. Using Local-Admin, Recover, select the user's name from the list. This will
  set the user's password to the global password as defined in the ADMIN.EXE
  program under Local-Admin, Options, Password.

4. Have the user login to Schedule+ using the global password.

  a. The user will receive the following dialog box:

  The local copy of your schedule file could not be accessed in the location
  specified in your SCHDPLUS.INI file.

     Click the OK button.

  b. The Find Local File dialog box will appear.

     Click the New button.

  c. The user will receive another dialog box confirming that the new file has
     been created.

     Click the OK button.

At this point, the user should be able to login to Schedule+ without the error
occurring. The \MAILDATA\CAL\HEXID.CAL file associated with the user has been
copied into the local file, USERNAME.CAL.
