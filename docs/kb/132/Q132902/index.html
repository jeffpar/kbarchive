The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you install or upgrade a Systems Management Server Primary Site, the
Primary Site Configuration dialog screen reappears.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when an installation error is detected during the
installation phase, a component fails to install, or the component fails to
start correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the Primary Site configuration dialog screen reappears due to a component
failure during installation, investigate the source of the failure. The
SMSSETUP.LOG file in the root of the Systems Management Server Site Server C
drive is useful for finding installation/upgrade failure points.

Under no circumstances should the Systems Management Server share name comments
be changed from those created by Systems Management Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the Primary Site Configuration dialog screen reappears, it still contains
the information you entered earlier in the installation process (such as Site
Code, Site Name, Site Server, and Site Server Domain). If you change the Site
Code when the second dialog screen is displayed, Systems Management Server
Executive, Inventory Agent, and Package command Manager services do not install
successfully. The Systems Management Server installation program is dependent
upon the share comments created for shares SMS_SITE, SMS_SHR, etc.
