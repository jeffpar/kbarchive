SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot use the Bullets And Numbering command (on the Format menu) to place a
bullet in the middle of a sentence or paragraph.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. Because Bullets and Numbering is a paragraph level
format, bullets are always placed at the beginning of a paragraph. Bullets
cannot be placed in the middle of paragraphs or words.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use any of the following methods to insert a bullet
in the middle of a sentence.

Method 1: Use the Insert Symbol Command
---------------------------------------

1. On the Insert menu, click Symbol.

2. On the Symbols tab, click to select the bullet character.

3. Click Insert and then click Close.

Method 2: Use the ASCII Key Code
--------------------------------

Place the insertion point where you want to insert the bullet, and then follow
these steps:

1. Make sure NUM LOCK is on.

2. Hold down ALT, and then, using the numeric keypad, type 0 (zero) followed by
  "183" (without the quotation marks), the character code for the bullet.

Method 3: Use a Table
---------------------

Place your text inside a table. For example, if you want to have a bullet
approximately three inches from the left margin, create a two column table and
make the left column three inches wide. Place the insertion point in the right
column, and then use the Bullets and Numbering command to insert a bullet.

Method 4: Use a Macro
---------------------

Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including, but
not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a
particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are provided 'as
is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in all situations.
While Microsoft support professionals can help explain the functionality of a
particular macro, they will not modify these examples to provide added
functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to consult one
of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution Providers offer a wide range of
fee-based services, including creating custom macros. For more information about
Microsoft Solution Providers, call Microsoft Customer Information Service at
(800) 426-9400.

The following sample Visual Basic for Applications macro inserts a bullet.

     Sub InsertBullet()
        With Selection
        .Collapse Direction:=wdCollapseStart
        .InsertSymbol Font:="Symbol", CharacterNumber:=183, Unicode:=False
        End With
     End Sub

For more information about inserting Symbols, while in the Visual Basic for
Applications Editor, click the Office Assistant, type "InsertSymbol" (without
the quotation marks), click Search, and then click to view the "InsertSymbol
Method" topic.

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Microsoft Visual Basic Help is not installed on your
