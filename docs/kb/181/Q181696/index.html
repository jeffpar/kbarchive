SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to configure the Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft
Outlook Windows NT clients so that more than one person can use the clients on
the same computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To configure the Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft Outlook Windows NT client so
that more than one person can use the client on the same computer, follow these
steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Mail. If a Show Profiles button appears in the
  dialog box that is displayed, click it. If a Show Profiles button does not
  appear, proceed to step 2.

2. Click Add.

3. Click Manually Configure Information Services and then click Next.

4. Type a name for the profile in the Profile Name box, and then click Next.

5. Click Add, click Microsoft Exchange Server in the list of available
  information services, and then click OK.

6. Type the name of the Microsoft Exchange Server computer to which you want to
  connect in the Microsoft Exchange Server box, type a mailbox name in the
  Mailbox box, and then click Next. Note that you can click Check Name before
  you click OK to verify the server and mailbox names.

7. Click Add, click Personal Address Book in the list of available information
  services, and then click OK.

8. Type the full path and file name of the personal address book (PAB)
  associated with the mailbox that you specified in step 6, and then click OK.
  Note that you can click Browse to locate the PAB instead of typing the full
  path and file name manually.

9. Click Add, click Personal Folders in the list of available information
  services, and then click OK.

10. Type the full path and file name of the set of personal folders associated
  with the mailbox that you specified in step 6, click Open, click OK, and
  then click OK again. Note that you can also locate the set of personal
  folders in the Create/Open Personal Folders File dialog box instead of
  typing the full path and file name manually.

  NOTE: To prevent people from reading other people's messages, each person
  should use a different password-protected set of personal folders. If more
  than one person uses the same set of personal folders, both people are able
  to read the other person's messages. In addition, if you do not assign a
  password to a set of personal folders, anyone who uses the client on that
  computer may be able to access that set of personal folders.

  If you specify an existing set of personal folders in the Create/Open
  Personal Folders File dialog box, you can specify a new password by clicking
  Change Password in the Personal Folders dialog box. If you do not know the
  current password, contact your network or system administrator. For
  additional information about lost or forgotten passwords for a set of
  personal folders, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q189126 Microsoft's Policy Regarding Missing or Invalid Passwords

  If you specify a new set of personal folders, you can specify a password on
  the Create Microsoft Personal Folders dialog box.

11. If you want to run Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft Outlook automatically
  when you start Windows NT, click "Add Outlook to the Startup group", and
  then click Next. If you do not want to run Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft
  Outlook automatically, verify that "Do not add Outlook to the Startup group"
  is selected, and then click Next.

12. Click Finish.

13. Repeat steps 2-12 for each additional person that you want to be able to use
  the client.

After you perform the above steps, the profile that appears in the "When starting
Windows Messaging, use this profile" box is used when you start Microsoft
Exchange or Microsoft Outlook. To cause Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft Outlook
to prompt you for the profile to be used when it starts, follow these steps:

1. In the client, click Options on the Tools menu.

2. Click the "Prompt for a profile to be used" option in the When Starting
  Microsoft Exchange area, and then click OK.
