WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft's Visual C++ Integrated Development Environment (IDE) recognizes the
following file extensions as C++ source files: .c, .cpp, and .cxx. In some
cases, a programmer may want to use other file extensions for C++ files; for
example, Unix C++ source files often use the .cc extension.

Using the steps in this article, source files with other file extensions may
benefit from the Visual C++ IDE's syntax coloring, automatic indentation, and
other usage enhancements. This article describes how to automatically compile
such files as C/C++ and associate the C++ icon with these files in Windows
Explorer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following procedure causes the Visual C++ IDE to recognize extensions other
than .c, .cpp, and .cxx as a C/C++ source file. These changes involve altering
registry settings.

To start the Registry Editor:

1. Close any running instances of Developer Studio.

2. On the Start menu, click Run.

3. Type "regedit" (without the quotation marks) and click OK to start the
  Registry Editor.

In the Registry Editor, repeat the following four steps for each new file
extension to associate with a C/C++ icon. These steps illustrate how to
associate the .cc file extension with the C++ source file icon:

1. Right-click HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT and select New | Key.

2. A key name will appear; change New Key #1 to .cc (the period is mandatory).

3. Click the new .cc key, then double-click Default in the right-hand pane of
  the Registry Editor.

4. In the Value Data field, type "cppfile" (without the quotation marks). Click
  OK.

NOTE: To associate a file extension with the C source file icon, use cfile
instead of cppfile. The values hppfile and hfile associate file extensions with
C++ and C header file icons, respectively. (In Windows Explorer, the appropriate
icon should now accompany files with the extension added in steps 1 through 4.
Clicking the icon will launch Visual C++. Don't do this just yet, though.)

The following steps apply to keys and values located on the home key. In the
Registry Editor, locate the user settings home key for Developer Studio. For
various versions, the home key is:

Version 6.0 (ships with Visual Studio 6.0):

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\DevStudio\6.0\ 

Version 5.0 (ships with Visual Studio 97):

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\DevStudio\5.0\ 

Versions 4.x:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Developer

The following registry keys cause the IDE to load the C/C++ compiler tool for the
specified file extensions (.cc illustrated):

1. Locate the following keys under Build System\Components\Platforms:

  Win32(ALPHA)\Tools\C/C++ Compiler for Alpha&lt;BR/&gt;
  Win32(PowerPC)\Tools\C/C++ Compiler for PowerPC&lt;BR/&gt;
  Win32(x86)\Tools\C/C++ Compiler for 80x86

  If WinCE 2.0 is installed, the following keys will also be present:

  Win32(WCE x86em)\Tools\C++ Compiler for 80x86em (Emulation)&lt;BR/&gt;
  Win32(WCE MIPS)\Tools\C/C++ Compiler Mips R4100&lt;BR/&gt;
  Win32(WCE SH)\Tools\C/C++ Compiler for SH&lt;BR/&gt;

2. Each of those keys has a setting called Input_Spec. Double-click Input_Spec;
  then, in the Value Data field, add ";*.cc" (without the quotation marks) to
  the end of the existing list of extensions. Click OK.

The following registry key determines the file extensions selected for syntax
coloring, smart indentation, and so on:

1. Locate the key Text:

  Text Editor\Tabs/Language Settings\C/C++

2. Double-click the FileExtensions setting; add ";cc" (without the quotation
  marks) to the end of the existing list of extensions. Click OK.

3. Close the Registry Editor.

4. Start Developer Studio and create a new file or open an existing one with the
  extension(s) just added. Syntax coloring and automatic indentation should be
  in effect.

NOTE: The new extensions will not appear in the Files of type list when you click
Open on the File menu. Use All Files (*.*) to view files with nonstandard
extensions. Alternatively, double-click the file from Windows Explorer; once it
loads into Visual C++, right-click inside the file's window and select Insert
File into Project to add the file to a project.

NOTE: External makefiles that are generated from Developer Studio will not have
the correct inference rules for new file extensions. Inference rules must be
added by either copying existing rules within the makefile (for example, adding
SUFFIXES:.cc at the beginning of the makefile and copying the .cpp.obj: rule to
create a .cc.obj: rule), or by adding rules in the TOOLS.INI file.

Although the IDE starts the C/C++ compiler tool for the file extensions added in
the steps above, the compiler needs to know whether to compile the file as C or
C++. The compiler normally compiles .c files as C, and compiles .cpp and .cxx as
C++. For all other extensions, the compiler needs an explicit parameter: /TC
compiles files as C, /TP compiles files as C++. Each project that includes files
with custom extensions needs an explicit /TC or /TP parameter. The following
steps illustrate how to do this:

1. Open a project in Developer Studio.

2. Click Settings on the Project menu.

3. In the resulting dialog box, select a configuration and a project (do not
  select All Configurations or multiple projects).

4. Click the C/C++ tab.

5. In the Project Options text box at the bottom, add /TP or /TC to the end of
  the listed options.

6. Repeat steps 3 through 5 for each configuration and each project in the
  workspace whose explicit compile type needs to be set. Click OK.

NOTE: Using /Tp"file.cc" and /Tc"file.cc" nevertheless generates the warnings
D4024 and D4027 with VC++ 6.0. However, with the registry changes mentioned
here, the file is properly compiled as the type specified. You may disregard the
warnings in this case.

This setting treats ALL source files built by the CL compiler tool in the project
as C++ (/TP) or C (/TC) files (the project options cannot be edited on a
per-file basis). The entire project now uses either the C++ compiler or the C
compiler. To treat individual files in a project as C++ or C source files, use
the /Tp&lt;source file&gt; or /Tc&lt;source file&gt; settings. See REFERENCES
for more information on the use of compiler settings.

If necessary, a custom build step can launch the C/C++ compiler (CL.EXE) with
settings specific to a single file. This is less desirable, because the custom
build step requires explicitly listing all of the compiler options. See
REFERENCES for online documentation of instructions on adding a custom build
step.
