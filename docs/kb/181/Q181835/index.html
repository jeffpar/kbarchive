IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start the Server service, you may experience one of the
following symptoms:

- When you attempt to start the Server service from the Services tool in
  Control Panel, you may receive the following error message:

  Could not start the Server service on \\&lt;Computer Name&gt;. Error 1058: The
  specified service is disabled and cannot be started.

- When you attempt to start the Server service from a command prompt, you may
  receive the following error message:

  System error 1058 has occurred.
  The specified service is disabled and cannot be started.

- When you attempt to enable the Server service for the current hardware
  profile, the current hardware profile may be missing from the list of
  profiles or the Enable button may be unavailable.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you are running Windows NT on a Dell computer and
Windows NT was preinstalled on your computer.

NOTE: This behavior does not occur if you have Windows NT preinstalled on a Dell
computer shipped from the factory that was manufactured after 4/6/99.

Method 1

Method 2

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

Delete the following registry keys, and then restart Windows NT:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\Root\LEGACY_BROWSER

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\Root\LEGACY_LANMANSERVER

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\Root\LEGACY_MESSENGER

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\Root\LEGACY_SRV

NOTE: To remove the keys noted in the article, you must increase security on
"Everyone" to full control and then propagate throughout the subfolders using
Regedt32.exe.
