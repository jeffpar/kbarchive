SUMMARY
=======

MIDISmpl.exe is a self-extracting compressed file containing a Visual Basic
project that demonstrates controlling a MIDI device using some Windows API
functions. You can use the code in this project to control a MIDI device from
within your program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following files are available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  Midismpl.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/vb50ent/Sample4/1/W9XNT4/EN-US/Midismpl.exe)

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

When you run the self-extracting executable file, the following files are
expanded into the MIDI Sample Project directory of your hard drive:

- Form1.frm (16Kb) - the main form of the project.

- MIDISmpl.vbp (1Kb) - the project file.

- MIDISmpl.vbw (1Kb) - the workspace file.

- Module1.bas (10Kb) - Module containing the API function declare statements
  and constants.

- Readme.txt - you are currently reading this document.

You can run this project using a MIDI keyboard, a mouse, or your keyboard as a
MIDI controller. The main form has a volume control, a ten-key keyboard, and
three menu items.

The MIDI Device menu allows you to set the MIDI device to another MIDI device.
The contents of this menu depends upon the number of MIDI output devices you
have installed in your system.

The Channel menu allows you to set what MIDI channel the project will control.

The Base Note menu allows you to set the note of the first key in the keyboard.
For example, the default setting of 60 corresponds to the middle C note. The
first key in the keyboard or the Z key will play a middle C.

How the Sample Works
--------------------

The midiOutGetNumDevs function is used to determine if there are any MIDI devices
and how many devices in the system. To find out the capabilities of the MIDI
device in the system, use the midiOutGetDevCaps that contains a pointer to the
User defined type variable containing the capability information. The
midiOutOpen and midiOutClose functions respectively open and close the MIDI
devices to receive MIDI instructions. The midiOutShortMsg function is used to
send the MIDI instruction.
