-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Remote Reboot feature of Systems Management Server on a client
computer running Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2), the following message
is displayed during the restart:

  Windows was not properly shut down. One or more of your disk drives may have
  errors on it. Press any key to run ScanDisk on these drives.

CAUSE
=====

Remote Reboot issues a CPU reset instruction, not a graceful shutdown.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.1 and 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service
pack for Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining the
service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
(without the spaces):

  S E R V P A C K

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do any one of the following:

- Open the Msdos.sys file and add the following line to the [Options] section:

        Autoscan=0

  NOTE: This method completely disables the OSR2 Autoscan feature. The kernel
  does not check the Clean Shutdown and Hard Disk Error bits, and ScanDisk is
  not started.

- Obtain the hotfix mentioned in STATUS section below. This fix should have the
  following timestamp:

     2/9/98   10:05am         144,896    Idisp16.dll

- Wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 95 OSR2 includes versions of the Io.sys and Win.com files that check the
Clean Shutdown and Hard Disk Error bits in the Virtual File Allocation Table
(VFAT) during startup. If either of these bits is enabled (that is, cleared to
0) on any drive present in real mode, you are prompted to run ScanDisk. If you
do not press a key within 60 seconds, ScanDisk runs anyway.
