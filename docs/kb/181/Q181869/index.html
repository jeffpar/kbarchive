SYMPTOMS
========

When roving profiles are implemented, Desktop or Start Menu folders that are not
empty when you delete them from the client computer are not deleted from the
server profile when you log off. When you log back on, the folders are restored,
and are empty.

Note that if an empty folder is deleted, it is deleted from the server profile,
and is not restored during logon.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because during the logoff process, in order to synchronize
the server copy of the desktop with the client, the folder structure of the
client desktop is first enumerated in a hierarchical order, parent folders
first. The server copy of the desktop is also enumerated, and compared to the
client hierarchy. Differences found between them are the source of a work list,
that includes file and folder deletions to be performed. The work list is
processed in the same order as the enumeration, and since parent folders are
listed first, they are not empty when the delete request is issued to the
server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. This
problem no longer occurs in Windows 98. To resolve this problem, install the
current version of Windows. For information about the current version of
Windows, visit the following Microsoft Web site:
