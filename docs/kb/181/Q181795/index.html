-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start the Microsoft Exchange Directory service after halting
the restore process or a failed restore process, the following event ID may
appear in the Event Viewer Application log:

  Event ID: 1196
  Source: MSExchangeDS
  Type: Information
  Category: Internal Processing

  Couldn't recover the restored Microsoft Exchange database (EDB). Cannot
  continue. Error c7ff0007.

CAUSE
=====

The Restore In Progress registry subkey exists. This is by design. The Restore
In Progress registry subkey exists to stop the Microsoft Exchange Directory
service from starting.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To work around this problem, remove the registry key and restart the Microsoft
Exchange Directory service and all dependent services. The Restore In Progress
registry subkey is located at:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/Current_Control_Set/Services/MSExchangeDS/ 
  Restore In Progress
