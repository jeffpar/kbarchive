SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to create more than one table of contents in one
document using Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create more than one table of contents, follow these steps:

1. Create a separate bookmark for each section of the document for which you
  want to create a table of contents. To create the bookmark:

  a. Select the entire section and then click Bookmark on the Insert menu.

  b. In the Bookmark Name text box, type a name for the bookmark, for example
     "part1" (without the quotation marks), and then click Add.

2. Repeat step 1 for each section of the document for which you want to build a
  separate table of contents.

3. If you will be generating the table of contents based on the built-in heading
  styles, then apply the styles as required. If you will be generating the
  table of contents with other styles, then apply those styles as required.

4. If you will be using TC fields to generate the table of contents, then mark
  the text that you want to include in the table as follows:

  a. Select the text that you want to include and then press ALT+SHIFT+O.

     The Mark Table of Contents Entry box will appear.

  b. To assign a different indent level to the text, change the number in the
     level box.

  c. Choose Mark when you're done.

  Word will create a TC field in the document that contains the text that you
  selected. Note that you can also insert a TC field in your document by
  clicking Field on the Insert menu. Under Categories, click Index And Tables,
  click TC under Fields, and then type the desired text.

5. To create the Table of Contents for the first section that you bookmarked,
  follow these steps:

  a. Place the insertion point where you want the table of contents for that
     section to appear.

  b. On the Insert Menu, click Field. In Categories select Index and Tables,
     and then under Field names, select TOC, and then click Options to bring up
     the Field Options dialog box.

  c. Choose the \b switch and click Add to Field, and then type in the bookmark
     name after the switch. For example "TOC \b part1" (without the quotation
     marks). Click OK twice.

     Word will default to building the table of contents based on the built-in
     heading styles if no other switches are added to the field.

  d. The following are examples of some other switches that can be added to the
     field:

  \f builds a TOC using TC field entries
  \t builds a TOC using other Style names
  \o builds a TOC using Heading Styles (outline levels)

  NOTE: If you want to build the TOC using Heading styles as well as TC fields
  or other Styles, then you must add the \o switch as well as the \f and \t
  switches.

6. Repeat steps 3-5 for each section of the document for which you want to
  create a separate table of contents.

For more information about table of contents fields, click Contents And Index on
the Help menu, click the Index tab in Word Help, type the following text

  fields, index

and then double-click the selected text to go to the "Use field codes for
indexes, tables of contents, or other tables" topic. If you are unable to find
the information you need, ask the Office Assistant.

This procedure can also be used to create multiple indexes or tables of
authority.
