The information in this article applies to:

- The AppWizard, used with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Custom AppWizards can not make per-file settings or per-file custom build steps
on the projects they generate, such as modifying the compiler settings for one
.cpp in a project or adding a custom build step to run MIDL on a project's IDL
file.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

NOTE: This problem has been addressed in Visual C++ 6.0 by new methods added to
the Configuration object: AddFileSetting, RemoveFileSetting, and
AddCustomBuildStepToFile.

MORE INFORMATION
================

As of Visual C++ 5.0, an automation object model exists that allows COM clients
to automate and control the Developer Studio shell. Custom AppWizards now have
an extra override in their CCustomAppWiz-derived class, CustomizeProject, which
gives the custom AppWizard access to the project settings for the project it is
generating. Using IConfiguration interfaces from CustomizeProject's
IBuildProject interface, the custom AppWizard can call AddToolSettings,
RemoveToolSettings, and AddCustomBuildStep to change various project settings.

Unfortunately, AddToolSettings, RemoveToolSettings, and AddCustomBuildStep
operate on the entire project only; they cannot make tool settings or create
custom build steps for a single file. The current Developer Studio object model
does not support this. Custom build steps for single files must be added by hand
after the custom AppWizard generates the projects. Settings made with
AddToolSettings and RemoveToolSettings are applied to all files in the project
for the specified tool. Custom Build steps added with AddCustomBuildStep run at
the end of the build process only and cannot be used to generate dependent
files.

For more information about using CustomizeProject to change the settings of a
generated project, refer to the Developer Studio documentation on the Developer
Studio Object Model. For additional information, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
