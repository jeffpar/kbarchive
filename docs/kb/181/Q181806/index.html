SYMPTOMS
========

If you configure a service to start with a specific account and password within
a domain, certain conditions may prevent the service from starting.

CAUSE
=====

The service may not start for any of the following reasons:

- A domain controller for that domain is not available.

- You used the wrong service account or password for the service.

- The password for the service account has changed or expired.

- The service account is disabled or does not have rights to log on as a
  service.

- The problem may be network related if the computer that runs the service is
  not a domain controller.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, make sure you use the correct account and password for
the service and check network connectivity with the domain and domain
controllers.

If the computer uses the Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) for name
resolution, make sure the appropriate WINS servers are available. Also, make
sure all applicable network routes exist to allow connectivity with a domain
controller. If the computer uses dynamic Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
routing, on some networks the service may try to start without having received
the dynamic routing table. To help avoid this issue, use a default gateway or a
persistent route to at least one domain controller on the domain.
