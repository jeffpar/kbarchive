SYMPTOMS
========

An Outlook 8.0x or Outlook 8.5 client running on Windows NT 4.0 Workstation or
Windows 95/98 with language settings set to an East European language gets a
non-delivery report (NDR) similar to that below, when sending from a Microsoft
Mail postoffice to Exchange Server:

  Your Message

  To: User
  Subject: Subject

  Was not delivered for the following reasons:

  Delivery failed to MS:NETWORK/PO/USER
  Reason: 0 (transfer failed)
  diagnostic: -1 (no diagnostic).
  MSEXCH:MSExchangeMTA:

  Original message body follows...

The Outlook client is connected to a Microsoft Mail postoffice, and the
postoffice is connected to Exchange Server using the Microsoft Mail Connector,
as follows:

  Outlook -&gt; Postoffice -&gt; Microsoft Mail Connector -&gt; Exchange Server
  5.0

The following messages are written to the Windows NT Application Event log:

  Event ID: 2025 (IS Priv)
  Description: The delivery of a message failed due to error 80004005. A
  non-delivery report is being sent to the message's originator.

  -and-

  Event ID: 270 (MTA)
  Description: A permanent error has occurred with Entity
  /O=org/OU=orgunit/CN=CONFIGURATION/CN=SERVERS/CN=user/CN=MICROSOFT PRIVATE
  MDB. Entity is a Message Object is a Normal Priority Message. Object:
  06000046. Message ID: C=country;A=admd ;P=prmd;L=organisation-site-000000AF

  938313230383135313430302D303530308201008302060000000000, PDU dump reference 1
  [MTA SUBMIT 16 74] (14)

  -and-

  Event ID: 290 (MTA)
  Description: A non-delivery report (reason code transfer-failure and
  diagnostic code Omit any diagnostic code) is being generated for message
  C=country;A=admd ;P=prmd;L=organisation-site-000000AF. It was originally
  destined for DN:/o=org/ou=orgunit/cn=Recipients/cn=user1 (recipient number
  1), and was to be redirected to. [MTA DISP:RESULT 18 136] (12)

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the Microsoft Exchange Server information store
receives a message from the message transfer agent (MTA) and detects that there
are two MAPI properties for strings within the message that have conflicting
code page IDs. The information store sends an NDR on the message because the
discrepancy was encountered.

This problem does not occur if an Eastern European Exchange client is used
instead of the Eastern European Outlook client. This is because the Eastern
European Outlook client includes four additional MAPI properties for the TNEF
portion of the message, one of which is an additional string property containing
a code page ID.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 service pack that contains
this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.
