IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

If a connection is configured to activate "On Demand" or "By Administrator," the
node will issue an initial Open Link request. When the connection is activated,
the node issues a Close Link request, then an Open Link request for the actual
connection. If a distributed link service (DLS) is configured to use a fixed IP
port number through the LocalIPport registry entry, the second Open Link request
will fail because the port will be in a Time_Wait state from the first
Open/Close Link request.

A new registry entry has been added to allow a range of IP ports. This registry
entry is necessary to allow the connection to recover or be recycled in a timely
fashion. The remote link service will cycle through the range of ports specified
in LocalIPPortRange until it either finds a free port or has exhausted all ports
in the specified range. To add this registry key, perform the following steps:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\SnaRemx\Parameters\SnaTCP

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

  Value Name: LocalIPPortRange
  Data Type: REG_DWORD
  Value: 1 (The default value is 1.)

4. Quit Registry Editor.
