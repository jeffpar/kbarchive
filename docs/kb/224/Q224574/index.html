The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server version 2.0 fails to correctly identify LANDesk 6.x as
a third-party Remote Control software package. If a computer is configured to
use LANDesk version 6.x and the client computer is moved into a Systems
Management Server 2.0 site where Remote Tools client agent has been enabled,
LANDesk is overwritten. Systems Management Server 2.0 does not recognize that
this was a LANDesk client. The Systems Management Server remote tools are
installed over the LANDesk tools, thus replacing Kbstuff.sys and replacing other
registry settings. This effectively disables the LANDesk Remote Control
functionality on that particular client. If Intel LANDesk version 6.x has been
deployed to the site, and you want to enable Systems Management Server 2.0
Remote Control at the site but do not want existing LANDesk users to migrate
from LANDesk Remote Control to Systems Management Server 2.0 Remote Control, you
can place a text file with the name Wuser32.exe in the System32 directory. This
"fools" Systems Management Server into thinking that this is another third-party
Remote Control utility and does not overwrite the LANDesk installation. This
fake Wuser32.exe file must be removed before Systems Management Server 2.0 will
install the Systems Management Server version of Remote Control.

CAUSE
=====

When Systems Management Server 2.0 installs the Remote Control component, it
performs a search of the top-level directories on all the local hard disk drives
for a file called Wuser32.exe or Wuser.exe. Previous versions of Intel LANDesk
installed to C:\LDClient. LANDesk version 6.x installs into the C:\Program
Files\LDClient directory. When the Remote Control installation program searches
for the Wuser32.exe or Wuser.exe file, it fails to find the file because the
search is not deep enough.
