SUMMARY
=======

UpDnDate.exe is a sample that demonstrates how the new DateTime picker control
can be used in an MFC application. In addition to illustrating the code that
needs to be written in order to use such a control with callback fields, the
sample also shows how to handle notifications sent by the child spin button
created when the DTS_UPDOWN style is specified for the date time control.

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft scanned this file for viruses. Microsoft used the most current
virus-detection software that was available on the date that the file was
posted. The file is stored on secure servers that prevent any unauthorized
changes to the file.

The code included is based on a Visual C++ version 6.0 AppWizard generated dialog
based application. The points of interest are:

- The datetime picker control inserted in the dialog template has the
  DTS_UPDOWN style.

- The WM_INITDIALOG handler for the parent dialog defines the callback field,
  with a call to CDateTimeCtrl::SetFormat().

- The CDateTimeCtrl-derived class CUDDateTimeCtrl implements handlers for the
  relevant reflected notifications: DTN_FORMAT, DTN_FORMATQUERY, DTN_WMKEYDOWN,
  following the guidelines from the online help.

- CUDDateTimeCtrl implements a handler for the UDN_DELTAPOS notification, sent
  to the date time control by the child spin button (created due to the
  DTS_UPDOWN style).

- CUDDateTimeCtrl::OnNotifyDeltaPos() cannot identify the field that has the
  focus. To work around this, the control sends a WM_KEYDOWN and WM_KEYUP
  message (with VK_UP or VK_DOWN as arguments) to itself.

- CUDDateTimeCtrl::OnNotifyDeltaPos() shortcuts the default implementation,
  even for the standard fields of the control. Instead, it posts WM_KEYDOWN,
  WM_KEYUP messages to the control. This is done in order to work around a bug
  that exists in the date time picker common control shipped with Internet
  Explorer 4.0 (comctl32.dll version 4.70-4.72). The bug is fixed in the
  Internet Explorer 5.0 release (comctl32.dll version 5.00).

To see the control in action, build the project and run it. Set the focus to the
custom field and either press the up or down arrow keys or use the mouse to
click on the up or down buttons of the spin control. You'll see that all fields
of the date time control are updated as expected.
