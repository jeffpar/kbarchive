The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Expedia Streets and Trips 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view or print certain parts of a route in Microsoft Expedia Streets and
Trips 2000, the hash marks for the route may not be visible and the highway
boundary lines may be broken up.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if a portion of your route passes through a construction
zone on a limited access highway.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, use one of the following methods.

View or Print Smaller Areas of the Map
--------------------------------------

To increase the clarity of the outline of the highway, zoom in on the map to view
the route on the screen, or print the route in smaller sections. To zoom in on
the map, press the F6 key.

Use the Black-And-White Map Option to Print the Map
---------------------------------------------------

To use the Black-And-White Map option to print the map, follow these steps.

NOTE: When you use this method, Streets and Trips 2000 uses the same tone of gray
to print the hash marks for the normal, road construction, and road closure
zones on your route.

1. On the File menu, point to Print, and then click Map Or Driving Directions.

2. Under Options, click to select the Black-And-White Map check box.

3. Select any other print options you want to use, and then click OK.

Disable the Display of Construction Zones
-----------------------------------------

To disable the display of road construction and road closure information on your
route, follow these steps:

1. On the Route menu, click Trip Options.

2. On the Profile tab, click to clear the Display Highway Construction On Trip
  check box, and then click OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Expedia Streets and
Trips 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The color for limited access highways in Expedia Streets and Trips 2000 is
yellow. Because Streets and Trips 2000 changes the color of the hash marks for a
route from green to yellow when your route passes through a construction zone,
you may have difficulty seeing any part of your route that passes through a
construction zone on a limited access highway.

You cannot change the color of limited access highways or construction zone hash
marks in Streets and Trips 2000.
