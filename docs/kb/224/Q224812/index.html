SYMPTOMS
========

After you add the French Canadian input locale and select the Canadian Standard
keyboard layout, the SPACEBAR, BACKSPACE, and ENTER keys do not work. One or
more of these keys may appear to work intermittently for some programs.

You can add the French Canadian input locale by clicking Add in the Control Panel
Keyboard tool. You can choose the Canadian Standard keyboard layout by clicking
Property on the Input Locales tab with the French Canadian input locale
selected.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs because of a problem in the Kbdcan.dll file.
