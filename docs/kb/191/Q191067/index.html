-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When roaming user profiles are used, it is possible that Appctl32.exe will
attempt to configure the desktop before the server-based profile is loaded on to
the local workstation. This will result in Appctl32.exe failing to configure the
user's desktop with the shared applications.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  08/05/98   03:30pm      173.0 KB   Smsrun32.exe (Alpha)

NOTE: Due to file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that contains
the above files may also contain additional files.



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem and successfully configure the desktop computer,
manually run Program Group Control (PGC) from the SMS Client group after logging
on.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The new version of Smsrun32.exe implements a configurable time delay before
loading the applications in the [Startup] section of the Smsrun32.ini file.

To configure the amount of time Smsrun32.exe will wait, add the following line to
the [Local] section of the Sms.ini file on the client, where xxxxx is the time
in milliseconds:

  SmsrunStartupDelay=xxxxx

When Smsrun32.exe starts, it will sleep for the requested amount of time before
starting to load the applications in the [Startup] section of the Smsrun32.ini
file. This should allow sufficient time for Windows to complete loading the user
profile.

To install the hotfix, perform the following steps on the Systems Management
Server site server:

1. Replace the Smsrun32.exe file in the
  &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\&lt;Platform&gt;.bin
  directory with the hotfixed version.

2. Replace the Smsrun16.exe file in the
  &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\X86.bin directory with the
  hotfixed version.

3. Maintenance Manager will replicate the new Smsrun32.exe to the
  Logon.srv\&lt;Platform&gt;.bin directory on the Systems Management Server
  logon servers during its next work cycle. After that occurs, you can update
  the clients. To update the clients, either manually run Upgrade.bat on each
  client or follow the instructions in the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q166771 SMS: How to Force Site-Wide Client Updates

4. Then update the Sms.ini file on the clients with the SmsrunStartupDelay line.
  An easy way to do this is to create a Systems Management Server Installer
  script that modifies the Sms.ini and sends it as a Package Command Manager
  (PCM) job to the client computers.

NOTE: You can perform steps 1 and 2 automatically by running Hotfix.exe with the
Hotfix.ini file provided.
