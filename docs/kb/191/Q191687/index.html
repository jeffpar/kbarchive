The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
- Microsoft Outlook 2000, Service Release 1 (SR-1) 
- Microsoft Outlook 98 
- Microsoft Outlook 97 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to send or receive messages using Outlook Express or Outlook, you
may receive an error message. When you try to send a message to your Simple Mail
Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server, you may receive the following error message:

  The connection to the server has failed. Account: 'your_account',
  Server:'your_SMTP_server', Protocol:SMTP, Port: 25, Secure(SSL): NO,
  Socket error: 10061, Error Number: 0x800ccc0e

Similarly, when you start the e-mail client or try to receive a message from your
Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) server, you may receive the following
error:

  The connection to the server has failed. Account: 'your_account',
  Server:'your_POP3_server', Protocol:POP3, Port: 110, Secure(SSL): NO,
  Socket error: 10061, Error Number: 0x800ccc0e

CAUSE
=====

The client connects to a port that is blocked or unavailable on the mail server.
If the client is attempting to send a message, the blocked port is 25, and if
the client is attempting to retrieve a message, the blocked port is 110. Refer
to the error message for the protocol and port numbers.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, make ports 110 and 25 available. Ports 110 and 25
are available by default when the Exchange Server services start. The ports 110
for POP3, 119 for Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP), and 143 for Internet
Message Access Protocol (IMAP) are automatically opened and made available on
the Exchange Server computer when the Information Store service starts. Port 25
is automatically made available when the Internet Mail Service starts. If these
services do not start, then the ports are not available.

If the services are running, you can verify that these ports are listening (open)
on the server by using the Netstat utility that is included with Windows NT
Server:

1. Open a command prompt on the Exchange Server computer. You need to modify the
  command prompt properties, because the data scrolls off the screen. Open the
  command prompt, right-click the upper-left corner of the window, and then
  click Properties. Click the Layout tab, and then change the screen buffer
  size to 1,000. Apply the change. You are prompted to either modify the
  current window or the shortcut that you used to start the command prompt. You
  can modify the shortcut for future convenience.

2. At the command prompt, type "netstat -an" (without the quotation marks).
  Scroll back to the beginning of the data output, and look for the following
  entries.

  

  Proto Local Address          Foreign Address        State
 TCP    0.0.0.0:25             0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING
 TCP    0.0.0.0:110            0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING

If these entries are present, Exchange Server is listening on ports 110 and 25 on
all interfaces. This is normal. If these ports are not available, you may need
to further troubleshoot the following services or systems. The following general
causes may "hold" these ports, or make them unavailable:

- The Exchange Server information store service is not running, or the POP3
  protocol is not enabled and listening to port 110. Verify that the
  information store service is running.

article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

- The Internet Mail Service is not running or is not listening on port 25.
  Verify that the Internet Mail Service is running.

Base:

- A proxy server located between the client and the server may be blocking
  access to these ports to the Exchange Server computer.

server, click the article numbers below to view the articles in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q176466 XGEN: TCP Ports and Microsoft Exchange: In-depth Discussion

- Another application, such as virus-scanning software, has reassigned port 25
  to another port. Disable all non-essential services, including antivirus
  software, and then restart the server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is also possible to receive this error message when you have antivirus e-mail
protection enabled on your computer.
