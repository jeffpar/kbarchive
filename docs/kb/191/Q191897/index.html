- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you change the FillStyle property of a Shape control from Transparent to
Solid at run-time, the Shape control may not redraw properly. This can happen on
a transparent UserControl that is using a mask.

RESOLUTION
==========

Set the Windowless property of the UserControl to True or call the Refresh
method of the Shape control after changing the FillStyle to Solid.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Shape control does not fill in the shape when you change its FillStyle from
Transparent to Solid at run-time. This happens on a UserControl that has the
BackStyle set to Transparent, and you have created a masked area by setting the
MaskPicture and MaskColor properties. You will only see this problem if the
Windowless property of the UserControl is False.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
  default.

2. Add a UserControl to the project.

3. Set the BackStyle of the UserControl to 0 (Transparent).

4. Set the MaskPicture of the UserControl to an available bitmap, set the
  MaskColor to a color found in that picture, and set the BackColor of the
  UserControl to something noticeable.

5. Place a Shape on the UserControl so that it will cover part of the masked and
  non-masked areas.

6. Insert the following code into the UserControl:

        Private Sub UserControl_Click()
          Shape1.FillStyle = 0
          ' Uncomment the following line to fix this bug
          'Shape1.Refresh
        End Sub

7. Close the UserControl designer window so that the UserControl becomes
  available on the Toolbox.

8. Place the UserControl on Form1.

9. Run the project.

10. Click on a non-masked area of the UserControl.

  RESULT: The FillStyle of the shape is now solid. However, only those parts of
  the control that were not masked before are colored. The expected result is
  that the entire Shape (rectangle) be drawn on top of the UserControl.
