-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to save a file on your Internet Information Server (IIS) computer,
one of the following error messages appears:

  Cannot create file

  -OR-

  Another user or process has modified the file. Do you wish to reload it?

  -OR-

  Access is denied.
  The file associated with this document has been moved or deleted
  outside of [third-party application]. You may want to resave the
  document before continuing.

CAUSE
=====

The file you are trying to save was recently viewed through IIS. Because IIS
caches file handles for performance, some editors are unable to close the file.

The editors HomeSite, DreamWeaver, and EditPad are known to generate errors when
attempting to overwrite cached files.

Microsoft Notepad and Microsoft FrontPage can overwrite cached files without
error.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use a different editor or use the Registry Editor
to disable caching of file handles.

WARNING: Disabling caching of file handles may seriously impact the performance
of your Internet Information Server computer. Use this workaround with caution.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

1. On the Start menu, click Run. In the Open box, type "regedit" (without the
  quotation marks). Click OK.

2. In the left pane, click the plus sign (+) to the left of each of the
  following items (in order):

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
     SYSTEM
        CurrentControlSet
           Services
              InetInfo
                 Parameters

3. In the left pane, click the Parameters key to select it.

4. On the Edit menu, click New and then point to DWORD Value.

5. In the right pane, a new value named "New Value #1" appears.

6. Rename the new value to DisableMemoryCache.

7. Double-click the value DisableMemoryCache. A dialog box appears. Change the
  Value Data to 1.

8. Click OK.

9. On the Registry menu, click Exit.

Restart the computer to make this setting take effect.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce the Problem:

1. Modify and save a file to your IIS server.

2. View the file in a Web browser.
