The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 SP4 
- Microsoft Routing and Remote Access Service Update for Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 includes two additional configuration options for
the Routing Information Protocol (RIP) Version 1 for Internet Protocol (IP). The
two new options let you control what routes are announced or accepted by IP RIP
on your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following registry parameters can be added to change the behavior of IP RIP
included in Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 with Service Pack 4.

NOTE: These parameters are not valid for the version of IP RIP included in the
Routing and Remote Access Service Update (RRAS). RRAS is available for download
from the following Web site:

  http://msdnisv.microsoft.com/communication/

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

To make changes using Registry Editor:

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Go to the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\IpRip\Parameters

  AnnounceRouteFilters
  Data type   = REG_MULTI_SZ
  Data        = x.x.x.x
  Description = List of routes to filter out when announcing routes. The
  data field represents the "Network Address" of the route.

  AcceptRouteFilters
  Data type   = REG_MULTI_SZ
  Data        = x.x.x.x
  Description = List of routes to filter out when accepting routes. The
  data field represents the "Network Address" of the route.

NOTE: When entering a value or values in the "Data" (Network Address) field
above, you must take into account that IP RIP version 1 only supports the
default classes. For example, if you wanted to filter a route table entry to the
131.107.35.0 network, you would use a value of "131.107.0.0" in the "Data"
field, NOT "131.107.35.0".
