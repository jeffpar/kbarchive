SUMMARY
=======

Checked binaries provide error checking, argument verification, and system
debugging code not present in the free binaries.

Much of the additional code in the checked binaries is in the form of ASSERT
macros that test an expression. If the expression evaluates to FALSE, the macro
generates a kernel debugger error message and breaks into the debugger. This
lets you immediately determine the cause and location of the error.

Use the free and checked builds of Windows NT as follows:

- Use the free build on the host machine, running WinDbg.

- Use the free build to develop and build a driver. Performance suffers in the
  checked build due to the additional code that is executed.

- Use the checked build on the target computer to test and debug a driver
  during the initial phases of its development.

- Use the free build on the target computer to test and debug your driver
  during the final phases of its development. The final testing of your driver
  must be done on a free version of the driver running the free build of
  Windows NT.

The extra protection of the checked build of Windows NT carries some penalties.
Because of the additional error checking code and debugging information, the
checked binaries are larger and run slower than the free binaries. This can
conceal synchronization or other timing-related problems, such as race
conditions, that become apparent only in the free build.

If you run the checked build of Windows NT without having enabled kernel
debugging, unexpected system shutdowns can occur. This is because the additional
checks in the checked build increase the likelihood of encountering a
breakpoint.
