SUMMARY
=======

Before Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 Service Pack 4 (SP4),
there was no method by which an administrator could apply a Systems Management
Server Service Pack with an unattended setup option.

Systems Management Server version 1.2 SP4 allows administrators to apply the
service pack with an unattended setup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The unattended installation of Systems Management Server 1.2 SP4 performs the
following steps:

1. Stops and restarts Site Configuration Manager so that secondary sites do not
  stop responding (hang).

2. Instructs Site Configuration Manager to stop all of the services, including
  PCMSVC32 and INVWIN32, and then shut down the site.

3. Copies files as appropriate, based on whether the site server functions as a
  secondary site server or a primary site server.

4. Performs database conversion and index installation for primary sites.

5. Merges the System.map file.

6. Restarts the site.

The unattended installation of the Service Pack does not upgrade the
Administrator Console installation on any secondary site servers or other
Administrator computers. Also note that the unattended installation does not
work on the Macintosh or OS/2 clients. Upgrades to those clients must continue
to be performed the same as they were in the past.
