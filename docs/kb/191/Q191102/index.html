Modem-to-Modem
--------------

  appears. When you see both your name and the guest player's name in the list,
  click OK.

7. Select the golf course, number of holes, type of pins, and weather conditions
  you want in the game.

8. If you want to change your player settings, click your name in the Available
  list, and then click Edit. When you are finished changing your player
  settings, click OK.

9. Click Add to move your player to the Selected list.

10. Click the guest player's name when it appears in the Available list, click
  Add to move it to the Selected list, and then click Next.

11. Select the type of game you want to play and the game options you want to
  use, and then click Next to start the game.

  settings, click your name in the Available list, and then click Edit. When
  you are finished changing your player settings, click OK.

8. Click Add to move your player to the Selected list.

9. Wait for the host to configure and start the game.

Network
-------

Hosting a network game:

Up to four players can play Golf on a local area network (LAN). All of the
computers you want to use for the game must be connected to the network, and
they all must use the same network protocol.

Golf supports both the TCP/IP and IPX network protocols for network multiplayer
games.

To host a Golf game on a network, follow these steps:

1. Insert the Golf CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive, and then start Golf.

2. On the Golf startup screen, click Multiplayer.

3. Click Network, type your name in the Connection Name box, and then click
  Next.

4. Click either TCP/IP or IPX, and then click Next.

5. Click Host.

6. In the Session Name box, type a name for the game, and then click OK.

7. When all of the players appear in the Host Game list, click OK.

8. Select the golf course, number of holes, type of pins, and weather conditions
  you want in the game.

9. If you want to change your player settings, click your name in the Available
  list, and then click Edit. When you are finished changing your player
  settings, click OK.

10. Click Add to move your player to the Selected list.

11. When other players appear in the Available list, click their names, and then
  click Add to move them to the Selected list. When all of the players are in
  the Selected list, click Next.

12. Select the type of game you want to play and the game options you want to
  use, and then click Next to start the game.

  Next.

4. Click either TCP/IP or IPX, and then click Next.

5. Click Show Games.

6. If you use the IPX network protocol, proceed to the next step. If you use the
  TCP/IP network protocol, the Locate Session dialog box appears. To connect to
  a game on a LAN, leave the Locate Session box empty, and then click OK. To
  connect to a game on the Internet, type the IP address of the host computer
  in the Locate Session box, and then click OK.

  NOTE: To determine your IP address in Golf, press F9 on any Golf multiplayer
  game startup screen.

7. In the Game Sessions box, click the game you want to join, and then click
  Join. When you connect to the host's computer, the Guest List screen appears.
  Wait for the host to launch the game session.

  settings, click your name in the Available list, and then click Edit. When
  you are finished changing your player settings, click OK.
