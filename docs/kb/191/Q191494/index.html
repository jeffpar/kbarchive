SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft has released the Dial-Up Networking 1.3 Upgrade.

The Dial-Up Networking 1.3 Upgrade (DUN 1.3) provides additional features for the
Dial-Up Networking components that were first introduced in Windows 95. DUN 1.3
includes all of the features of the 1.2 and 1.2b releases, and all of the
features of the earlier Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) 1.1 release.
These features include support for internal ISDN adapters, multilink support for
binding two ISDN channels, connection-time scripting to automate non-standard
login connections, and Point-to-Point Tunneling protocol (PPTP) client support.

Specification (NDIS) layer. A new version of Winsock is included as an optional
component to correct name resolution limitations in the original Windows 95
software.

You can apply the Dial-Up Networking 1.3 Upgrade to existing Window 95-based
computers, including the retail version of Windows 95, and Windows 95 OEM
Service Release 2 (OSR2).

The Dial-Up Networking 1.3 Upgrade is contained in a self-installing file named

system components are installed correctly.
