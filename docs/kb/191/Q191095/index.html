-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to update the included files in the Package and Deployment Wizard
(PDW) with a newer version of a file (located in a different folder than the
original), you receive the following error message:

  A file with this name has already been added to the list of files

The error occurs even if you clear the check box next to the file to be updated
before adding the new version of the file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around the problem, use one of the following five methods.

Method 1: Modify the Project (.vbp) File
----------------------------------------

If the file you are attempting to replace in the Included Files screen of the PDW
is the project's .exe file, the .vbp file is pointing to the wrong .exe file.
This can occur when you make the .exe, saving it to a different location, but do
not save the changes to the .vbp afterward.

To update the .vbp file to point to the correct .exe, then follow these steps:

1. Open the project in Visual Basic.

2. Make the .exe in the new location again.

3. Save the project.

These steps update the setting of Path32 in the .vbp file. When you rerun the
PDW, it will include the correct .exe file, even if you use an existing script.

Method 2: Copy New File Over Original File
------------------------------------------

Copy the new version of the file to the location of the original version, and
then rerun the PDW.

NOTE: Back up the original file to another location first if you want to keep
it.

Method 3: Copy New File to Redist Folder
----------------------------------------

Copy the new version of the file to the VB98\Wizards\PDWizard\Redist folder, and
then run the PDW again. By default, the PDW always looks for the files in the
Redist folder first.

Method 4: Copy New File to Support Folder and Rebuild CAB
---------------------------------------------------------

If you have previously created a Setup package for this project, you can copy the
new version of the file to the package's Support folder and then run the .bat
file in the same folder to re-create the Setup package.

NOTES:

- If the version number, date, or size of the new file is different from the
  original, you should also modify the entries for that file in Setup.lst. For
  additional information, please see the following articles in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:


  Q190077 : HOWTO: Set Number of .CAB's in Setup.lst After Repackaging

- This method is quick, but does not affect any of your future PDW sessions.

Method 5: Modify the Script (.pdm) File
---------------------------------------

You can manually modify the script (.pdm) file in a text editor, such as NotePad.
The .pdm file contains all the scripts for a single project, and it is a
recording of all the options you selected when packaging or deploying an
application using the PDW.

To modify the path to a folder in a script, open the project's .pdm file in a
text editor, and modify the path in all references to the file. After saving the
changes to the file, rerun the PDW.

NOTE:

- This method does not work for updating the path to the project's .exe file.
  The PDW picks up the path from the Path32 setting of the .vbp file instead.

- Make a backup copy of the .pdm file before modifying.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
  default.

2. Place a command button on Form1.

3. Save the project.

4. Compile the project by selecting Make Project1.exe on the File menu.

5. Run the PDW, and select the project you just created.

6. Click Package, and follow the instructions in the wizard to create the setup
  package.

7. Reopen Project1.vbp in Visual Basic, recompile the project, and save the
  executable in another location (for example, C:\Temp).

8. Run the PDW, and select Project1 again. Click Package, and follow the
  instructions in the wizard until you get to the "Included Files" screen.

9. Clear the check box for the original Project1.exe, and then click Add. In the
  Add File dialog box, select the new Project1.exe found in C:\Temp and click
  Open.

The following error message appears:

  A file with this name has already been added to the list of files You cannot
  add the new version of Project1.exe into the setup package.
