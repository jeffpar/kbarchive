Last Modified: 09-AUG-2001

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Conversion from FAT to NTFS fails and the following error message appears:

  Cannot create the elementary file system structures.
  The conversion failed
  C: was not converted to ntfs

This error occurs on Alpha systems when performing an unattended installation
using the following options in the Unattend.txt file:

     [Unattended]
     OemPreinstall = yes
     FileSystem = ConvertNTFS
     ExtendOemPartition = 1

CAUSE
=====

This problem only occurs if you apply the Alpha-based hotfix referenced in the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q185773
  TITLE : NTFS Corruption on Drives &gt; 4 GB Using ExtendOEMPartition

The ExtendOEMPartition option extends the partition to the maximum size of the
drive. The above hotfix enables this feature so that it works correctly on
drives exceeding 4 GB in size. There is a BIOS limitation on x86-based computers
that limit the maximum size of a partition to 7.8 GB. Because this limitation
does not exist on Alpha systems, the byte offset may exceed 32 bits. A problem
in Fastfat.sys fails any disk access that calculated a byte offset exceeding 32
bits.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack



NOTE: This fix applies to both x86 and Alpha platforms and supercedes the hotfix
referenced in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q185773
  TITLE : NTFS Corruption on Drives &gt; 4 GB Using ExtendOEMPartition

NOTE: In addition to the above file, the following additional files must be
obtained from the latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack. The service pack should be
of the same language as that being installed:

  x86           Alpha
  --------------------------
  Gdi32.dll     Gdi32.dll
  Hal.dll       Halgammp.dll
  Hal486c.dll   Halpinna.dll
  Halapic.dll   Halrawmp.dll
  Halast.dll    Halsabmp.dll
  Halcbus.dll   Kernel32.dll
  Halcbusm.dll  Ntdll.dll
  Halmca.dll    Ntkrnlmp.exe
  Halmps.dll    Ntoskrnl.exe
  Halmpsm.dll   User32.dll
  Haloli.dll    Win32k.sys
  Halsp.dll     Winsrv.dll
  Halwyse7.dll
  Kernel32.dll
  Ntdll.dll
  Ntkrnlmp.exe
  Ntoskrnl.exe
  User32.dll
  Win32k.sys
  Winsrv.dll

Perform the following steps to successfully install this hotfix:

1. Start the computer in MS-DOS mode and prepare the drive for Windows NT
  unattended installation as usual. This includes copying the .\I386 or .\Alpha
  folder from the Windows NT CD to the install directory on drive C.

2. Copy the fixed files into a temporary folder.

3. Apply the fixed files and required service pack dependency files to the
  install directory on drive C. The service pack CD should be that of the same
  language as that being installed. Because the service pack CDs are in Windows
  NT Unicode format, they cannot be read directly from MS-DOS. The service pack
  files may need to be transferred from a Windows NT system capable of reading
  the service pack CD or the service pack files can be read directly using
  MS-DOS from the Enterprise Server CD in the "\SP3\i386" or "\SP3\Alpha"
  directory. The service pack dependency files are listed above. This step can
  be performed automatically using the Oemsetup.bat batch file if you have the
  dependency files in an MS-DOS readable format. Otherwise, you must perform
  this step manually:

  Manual Instructions for the Intel Platform
  ------------------------------------------

  Batch File Option:

  From the temporary folder, run Oemsetup.bat, specifying both the source
  service pack folder and the target install folder. For example (assume D: is
  a service pack folder and C:\I386 is the install folder):

  OEMSETUP D:\SP3\I386 C:\I386

  This copies the necessary files to the I386 and C:\I386\System32 folders on
  drive C where the installation folder is located.

  Manual Option:

  You can also perform this step manually by first copying Fastfat.sys from the
  fix to the C:\I386 install folder, and then copy the following files from the
  latest Windows NT 4.0 service pack to the C:\I386 and C:\I386\System32
  folders as denoted below:

     Fastfat.sys     -&gt; ..\I386
     Hal.dll         -&gt; ..\I386
     Hal486c.dll     -&gt; ..\I386
     Halapic.dll     -&gt; ..\I386
     Halast.dll      -&gt; ..\I386
     Halcbus.dll     -&gt; ..\I386
     Halcbusm.dll    -&gt; ..\I386
     Halmca.dll      -&gt; ..\I386
     Halmps.dll      -&gt; ..\I386
     Halmpsm.dll     -&gt; ..\I386
     Haloli.dll      -&gt; ..\I386
     Halsp.dll       -&gt; ..\I386
     Halwyse7.dll    -&gt; ..\I386
     Ntdll.dll       -&gt; ..\I386 and  -&gt; ..\I386\SYSTEM32
     Ntoskrnl.exe    -&gt; ..\I386
     Ntkrnlmp.exe    -&gt; ..\I386
     Win32k.sys      -&gt; ..\I386
     User32.dll      -&gt; ..\I386
     Kernel32.dll    -&gt; ..\I386
     Gdi32.dll       -&gt; ..\I386
     Winsrv.dll      -&gt; ..\I386

  Then remove the compressed versions of these files from the C:\I386 and
  C:\I386\System32 folders. Compressed files are identified by the last
  character of the file type containing an underscore (_). For example, delete
  Fastfat.Sy_, Hal.dl_, Ntdll.dl_, Ntoskrnl.ex_, and so on.

  Manual Instructions for the Alpha Platform
  ------------------------------------------

  Batch File Option:

  From the temporary folder, run Oemsetup.bat specifying both the source service
  pack folder and the target install folder. For example (assume D: is a
  service pack folder and C:\Alpha is the install folder):

  OEMSETUP D:\SP3\Alpha C:\Alpha

  This copies the necessary files to the Alpha and C:\Alpha\System32 folders on
  drive C where the installation folder is located.

  Manual Option:

  You can also perform this step manually by first copying Fastfat.sys from the
  fix to the C:\Alpha install folder then copy the following files from the
  latest Windows NT 4.0 service pack to the C:\Alpha and C:\Alpha\System32
  folders as denoted below:

     Fastfat.sys     -&gt; ..\Alpha
     Halgammp.dll    -&gt; ..\Alpha
     Halpinna.dll    -&gt; ..\Alpha
     Halrawmp.dll    -&gt; ..\Alpha
     Halsabmp.dll    -&gt; ..\Alpha
     Ntdll.dll       -&gt; ..\Alpha and  -&gt; ..\Alpha\SYSTEM32
     Ntoskrnl.exe    -&gt; ..\Alpha
     Ntkrnlmp.exe    -&gt; ..\Alpha
     Win32k.sys      -&gt; ..\Alpha
     User32.dll      -&gt; ..\Alpha
     Kernel32.dll    -&gt; ..\Alpha
     Gdi32.dll       -&gt; ..\Alpha
     Winsrv.dll      -&gt; ..\Alpha

  Then remove the compressed versions of these files from the C:\Alpha and
  C:\Alpha\System32 folders. Compressed files are identified by the last
  character of the file type containing an underscore (_). For example, delete
  Fastfat.Sy_, Halgammp.dl_, Ntdll.dl_, Ntoskrnl.ex_, and so on.

4. Run Winnt.exe as usual to complete the Windows NT installation.

5. When the Windows NT installation is complete, apply the latest service pack
  immediately. This eliminates inconsistent releases of system files.
