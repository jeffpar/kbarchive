- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot create a bulleted outline list in Word 97 with multiple bullets on
some lines.

This behavior is different from earlier versions of Word. For example, in Word
for Windows 95, version 7.0, you can create a bulleted outline list by replacing
numbers with bullets in multilevel numbering and by then setting the Include
From Previous Level option to Numbers with the end result being one bullet on
level 1, two bullets on level 2, and so on. The resulting text resembles the
following:

  .
  ..
  ...

  -or-

  .  Some text.

    ..  Some text.

     ...  Some text.

However, in Word 97, you can have only one bullet per line for each level of your
outline. The standard multilevel bulleted list in Word 97 uses a different
bullet or indentation to distinguish each level of the list.

CAUSE
=====

The Include From Previous Level option is not available in the Customize Outline
Numbered List dialog box in Word 97. (It is available in the Modify Multilevel
List dialog box in Word 7.0.)

WORKAROUND
==========

In Word 97, if you open a document that was formatted in Word 7.0, if the list
includes a multiple-bullet bulleted list, you will see a custom multilevel
bulleted list available in Word 97 that has multiple bullets on some lines.

To duplicate this functionality in Word 97, you must start with a document that
has a bulleted list that is formatted with multiple bullets on some lines. You
can then create a template that will include this formatting by deleting all of
the unneeded text in the document with the exception of one or more paragraphs
that are formatted with the multi-bulleted list and save that document in Word
97 as a document template.

To save the document as a template, follow these steps:

1. On the File menu, click Save As.

2. In the Save As Type list, select Document Template (*.dot).

3. Change the file name if necessary, and click Save.

To use the multi-bulleted list, open a new document based on the new template. To
open a new document based on a template, follow these steps:

1. On the File menu, click New.

2. Click to select the template.

3. Click OK.

NOTE: You must have at least one line formatted with the bulleted list in your
document at all times. If you delete the last paragraph with this formatting or
remove the list formatting, you will lose the custom bulleted list option.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design of Microsoft Word 97.
