SYMPTOMS
========

If a Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW) script is saved over an existing script
file (.pdm), the new information is written at the beginning of the existing
file, instead of replacing the entire contents.

CAUSE
=====

The PDW will assume if an existing .pdm file exists in the same directory as the
Visual Basic Project file (.vbp) that the .pdm file is for that project and will
write information to this file.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The PDW can save package and deployment information for each application
processed by the wizard. This information is stored in a .pdm file in the
project directory and with the same name as the project. For example, if the
project was named Project1.vbp, the PDW will create a Project1.pdm in the same
directory as Project1.vbp.

A .pdm file is a text file containing one or more scripts with all information as
to the packaging and/or deployment of an application, including all necessary
files, installation locations, and the name of the script.

Since a project can be distributed several different ways, several deployment
packages can be created for a project, and all of the package/deployment scripts
are stored in the same .pdm file. New scripts are added to the beginning of the
projects .pdm file.

REFERENCES
==========

Deployment Wizard in MSDN.
