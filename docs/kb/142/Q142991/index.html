SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use wildcard characters when you use the Find
command to search for information on MSN, The Microsoft Network.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Find feature locates only information matching the exact word you type. For
example, if you type "art", the Find feature does not locate "arts" or
"artist".

To locate variations of a word, you can use the wildcard characters "*" and "?".
Use "?" as a wildcard for one character. Use "*" as a wildcard for no, one, or
multiple characters. For example:

- "art?" finds "arts" and "arty" but not "artist."

- "art*" finds "art," "arts," "artist," and any other word beginning with
  "art."

The following rules apply to using the "*" wildcard character:

- You can use "*" only at the end of a search string. For example, "*art" is
  not valid. The Find feature ignores the "*" character and finds only "art."

- Multiple instances of the "*" character are treated as a single instance.

- When the "*" character is followed by another character or wildcard, every
  character after "*" is ignored. For example, "ar*s" and "ar*?" are the same
  as "ar*."

The following rules apply to using the "?" wildcard character:

- You can place the "?" anywhere in a search string except the beginning. For
  example, "ar?s" is valid, but "?art" is not. If you search for "?art," the
  Find feature ignores the "?" character and locates only "art."

- You can use more than one "?" character in a search string.

- You cannot search for "?" alone. You will receive the error message "Letter
  or number required."
