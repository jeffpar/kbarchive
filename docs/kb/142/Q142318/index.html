SUMMARY
=======

There are occasions when you may need to remove a Toolbox component, an OLE
Control, or a Visual C++ 6.0 Component Gallery component from your project.
Because all components are different, the steps in this article are general
guidelines only.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Step-by-Step Procedure
----------------------

1. If you are attempting to remove a Toolbox component from your project, you
  may delete the component from the Visual Studio .NET designers. Any event
  handlers that you have added, such as the Click event handler for a button,
  must be manually deleted from your code (both the .cpp and .h files) because
  the designer does not delete the event handlers automatically.

2. In Visual C++ 6.0, if you are attempting to remove a Component Gallery
  component from your project, read the Results section of the component's Help
  file to find out what the component inserts into your application. If you are
  attempting to remove an OLE Control from your project, locate the wrapper
  classes for the OLE Control that have been inserted into your project.

3. Remove the source code files that were inserted into your project. Generally,
  these are source files that define the class and relevant code for the OLE
  Control or Component. For example, the Password Dialog Component creates and
  adds the PWDLG1.CPP and PWDLG1.H files to your project.

4. If you are attempting to remove a Component Gallery component, remove any
  code that is inserted into existing code files. For example, several
  Components insert code into a project's InitInstance() function. To find all
  occurrences of inserted code, search for "// CG:" in your .cpp files. This
  comment precedes each code insertion that was made to your application. Also,
  be sure to remove any added member declarations in the .h files, and make
  sure your remove all appropriate header files from these same source files.
  For example, to remove the Password Dialog Component from your project,
  remove the following from all files in your project:

        #include "pwdlg1.h"

  When you remove code, be sure to remove any associated message map entries.
  For example, the Clipboard Assistant Component adds a number of message map
  entries to a project.

5. Remove any added resources. For example, the Password Dialog Component
  inserts a dialog resource into the project's resource file (.rc).

In addition to the previous steps, some OLE Controls and Component Gallery
components insert data at the end of your project's .mak file for Visual C++,
versions 4.x. This data does not affect your project but might prevent you from
reinserting the Control or Component later. Developer Studio uses this data to
determine which controls to display in its Controls toolbar.

In Visual C++, versions 5.0 and 6.0, this information is stored in the .dsp file,
and the following instructions do not apply. Similar troubleshooting methods can
remove this information from the .dsp file, but directly modifying the project
file is unsupported.

In Visual C++, versions 4.x, you can identify this data by the Section keyword.
For example, inserting the Splash Screen Component adds the following text to
your project's .mak or file:

     #####################################################################
     # Section SplashIt : {21FFBCBF-33A6-11CF-9420-00AA00C14AF9}
     #   0:8:Splash.h:C:\SplashIt\Splash.h
     #   0:10:Splash.cpp:C:\SpashIt\Splash.cpp
     #   1:10:IDB_SPLASH:102
     #   2:10:ResHdrName:resource.h
     #   2:11:ProjHdrName:stdafx.h
     #   2:10:WrapperDef:_SPLASH_SCRN_
     #   2:12:SplClassName:CSplashWnd
     #   2:21:SplashScreenInsertKey:4.0
     #   2:10:HeaderName:Splash.h
     #   2:10:ImplemName:Splash.cpp
     #   2:7:BmpID16:IDB_SPLASH
     # End Section
     #####################################################################

To allow for re-inserting the Splash Screen Component, this section of text must
first be removed from the project's .mak or file.

WARNING: Remove only the entries for the component you want to delete. Do not
delete another component's entry that you may still need to keep.

To determine which Section entries belong to a particular component, you should
create a new MFC project, insert the component in question, and examine this new
project's .mak file. Then you can remove the identical Section entries from the
original project.
