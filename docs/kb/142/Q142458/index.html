The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can use the TP4 utilities (PING, TTXT.EXE, and TRXT.EXE) to test a network
connection before you install Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Notes:

- The Mail Gateway to X.400 provides a TP4 transport or connectionless protocol
  (CLNP).

- The TP4/CLNP protocol also includes diagnostic utilities: PING, TTXT.EXE, and
  TRXT.EXE.

PING
----

The PING utility tests the DLI/protocol driver interface at the data link level,
verifying data link layer connectivity. The PING utility operates as a loopback
test between the local network workstation that will be running the X.400
gateway MTA (X400GATE.EXE) and a remote network workstation, often the receiving
MTA running TP4 protocol.

1. Install the Microsoft Mail TP4/CLNP Drivers and Utilities disk on the hard
  drive of the gateway computer and modify PROTOCOL.INI, CONFIG.SYS, and
  AUTOEXEC.BAT as documented in Chapter 2 of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to
  X.400 "Administrator's Guide," pages 25-31.

2. From the C:\TP4\DIAG directory, created by the Microsoft Mail TP4/CLNP
  Drivers and Utilities disk, type:

  "ping MAC-address [count] [length] [subnetwork] [-u driver]" (without the
  quotation marks)

  The MAC-address is a 12 digit hexadecimal value of the receiving network
  workstation. If the MAC-address is unknown, have the remote user determine
  MAC-address from Microsoft Diagnostic Utility (MSD.EXE) under Networks or
  from the C:\TP4\UTIL\GETMAC.EXE utility.

  For more information on the use of the GETMAC.EXE utility, see page 40 of
  Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 TP4/CLNP "Administrator's Reference."

  NOTE: If the receiving network workstation is on another subnetwork make sure
  to include the subnetwork value that specifies the number of the adapter
  connected to the subnetwork where the remote system resides.

3. With the command line of PING 00AA00342C79 1000, a successful returning
  result will be:

  1000 test packet sent and received

TTXT and TRXT
-------------

1. Install the Microsoft Mail TP4/CLNP Drivers and Utilities disk on hard drive
  of the gateway computer and modify PROTOCOL.INI, CONFIG.SYS, and AUTOEXEC.BAT
  as documented in Chapter 2 of the Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400
  "Administrator's Guide," pages 25-31.

2. Go to the computer designated as the receiver. To determine the receivers
  NSAP, type GETNSAP from C:\TP4\UTIL directory.

  If no NSAP is displayed, use SETNSAP as documented on page 52 of Microsoft
  Mail Gateway to X.400 TP4/CLNP "Administrator's Reference."

3. Type "TRXT" (without the quotation marks) from the C:\TP4\DIAG directory.

4. Move to the computer designated as the transmitter.

5. Type "TTXT -N rx_nsap -c" (without the quotation marks) 3 from the
  C:\TP4\DIAG directory.

  Replace rx_nsap with the value for the receiver NSAP determined in step 2.

6. When you have typed the ttxt command line, one or more transport connection
  establishment messages appear on each system. For example, the transmitter
  station displays:

     00:00:00:   STC00  established 
     00:00:00:   STC01  established 
     00:00:00:   STC02  established

  The receiver station displays similar messages:

     00:00:01:   RTC00  established 
     00:00:01:   RTC01  established 
     00:00:01:   RTC02  established

During the trxt and ttxt testing, both computers periodically display throughput
messages, unless quiet mode was specified. If the default value was used for
reporting the interval, messages such as the following will be displayed at the
transmitter station after 30 seconds:

 00:00:30:   STC000    179.92  KB/sec     11.3   TSDU/sec     88   ms/TSDU
 00:00:30:   STC001    179.92  KB/sec     11.3   TSDU/sec     88   ms/TSDU
 00:00:30:   STC002    179.92  KB/sec     11.3   TSDU/sec     88   ms/TSDU

 00:00:30:   TOTAL3  CON  538.69  KB/sec 33.9 TSDU/sec 29   ms/TSDU

Similar messages will also be displayed at the receiver station after 30
seconds:

00:00:30:   RTC000    176.21  KB/sec     11.1   TSDU/sec     90   ms/TSDU
00:00:30:   RTC001    176.21  KB/sec     11.1   TSDU/sec     90   ms/TSDU
00:00:30:   RTC002    175.68  KB/sec     11.1   TSDU/sec     90   ms/TSDU
00:00:30:   TOTAL3  CON  528.11  KB/sec 33.3 TSDU/sec 30   ms/TSDU

1. To stop trxt and ttxt testing, press any key on the transmitter computer's
  keyboard. The receiver displays messages similar to the following:

     00:03:45:   RTC00    disconnected   reason   128
     00:03:45:   RTC01    disconnected   reason   128
     00:03:45:   RTC02    disconnected   reason   128

2. To stop the receiver, press any key on the receiver's keyboard.

  NOTE: Do not press CTRL+C or BREAK to stop the ttxt or trxt diagnostic
  utilities.

For further procedures and command line options for TP4/CLNP utilities, see
Chapter 3 of Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 TP4/CLNP "Administrator's
Reference."
