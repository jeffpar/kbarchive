SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect to MSN, The Microsoft Network, you may receive the
following error message:

  No dial tone. Please make sure that your modem is connected properly and
  turned on.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Plug a working phone into the phone jack that you use for your modem and
  check for a dial tone. If you hear no dial tone, the problem is with your
  phone service or wiring.

2. Check to see that the modem is correctly connected to the telephone jack.
  Plug the telephone line from the telephone jack into the line jack on the
  back of the modem. If there is more than one jack on the modem make sure that
  the line is plugged into the correct jack.

3. If the modem is an external modem, make sure that it is turned on.

4. Verify that the "Wait for dial tone before dialing" option is enabled. To do
  this, follow these steps:
  a. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

  b. Double-click Modems.

  c. Click your modem, and then click Properties.

  d. Click the Connection tab.

  e. Select the Wait for dial tone before dialing check box.

  f. Click OK, click Close, and then close Control Panel.

5. Verify that no running programs are using the modem. To do this, follow these
  steps:
  a. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE.

  b. In the Close Program dialog box, look for any program that may use the
     modem. Click that program, and then click End Task.

  c. Repeat this step until all programs that may be trying to use the modem
     are no longer running.

If these steps do not adequately resolve the issue, the Computer manufacturer, or
the Modem manufacturer may be able to provide further assistance. Also, consider
getting the line or phone jack checked by the phone company, or replacing the
phone cord itself.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "No dial tone" message may also be generated if you have automated voice
messaging installed. If there is even one message waiting on the telephone, it
beeps several times before generating a dial tone. Dial-Up Networking then
returns a "No dial tone" message. To resolve this issue, add two or three commas
before the number to be dialed. This allows the dialer to bypass the beeps and
hear the dial tone.
