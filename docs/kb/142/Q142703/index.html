The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
- Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In certain situations it may be necessary for a computer running MS-DOS
Networking Client 3.0 that is connecting to a Windows NT Server Domain to be
able to provide all user identification and password without the user being
present to enter this information at the system. This can be accomplished by
using a command line utility, several switches and a text file passed to the
utility.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The command line utility in the MS-DOS Networking Client 3.0 is the NET LOGON
command. In certain situations where power to an MS-DOS client is terminated
ungracefully, it may be desirable to configure the MS-DOS client to
automatically reconnect to the Windows NT domain with no user interaction or
where a user may be unavailable to interact with the system.

WARNING: The following set of procedures allows the MS-DOS client to basically
bypass normal Windows NT Domain USERID/PASSWORD security. User IDs and passwords
for this client are maintained in plain-text format and are accessible to anyone
who has direct access to the MS-DOS client. Therefore, it may be necessary,
depending upon your situation, to restrict this particular user's access to the
domain and its resources by implementing strict share level controls, group
controls, and/or limit this user's logon to the Medium Access Control (MAC)
address defined on the MS- DOS client's network interface board.

Configuring an MS-DOS Networking Client to Log On to Domain Automatically
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. On a Windows NT Domain Controller Server in User Manager create a user
  account to be used by the MS-DOS client. Provide password, group membership,
  home directory, logon times, logon script, logon location and other account
  information as deemed necessary.

2. Setup your MS-DOS 3.0 Networking Client system to automatically logon to your
  domain. This is done, if you used defaults values, by running SETUP.EXE from
  the C:\NET subdirectory on your client's hard drive. This setup program can
  be set to automatically run the network client at startup. It does this by
  adding NET commands to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file or by allowing you to use the
  NET commands in another batch file that can be called at startup (or when
  executed by a user). We will be editing this batch file in the next step.

3. At the MS-DOS client, run your text editor and remark out (REM) the NET START
  command.

  For example, this NETSTART.BAT is the batch file used on a client with the
  TCP/IP protocol:

     C:\NET\net initialize
     C:\NET\netbind.com
     C:\NET\umb.com
     C:\NET\tcptsr.exe
     C:\NET\tinyrfc.exe
     C:\NET\nmtsr.exe
     C:\NET\emsbfr.exe
     rem C:\NET\net start

  This keeps the network redirector from starting and allows us to start it with
  the options that are entered in the next line you see here:

  C:\NET\net logon {userid} {localpassword} /domain:{ntdomainname} /yes
        /savepw:no &lt; C:\NET\password.txt

  NOTE: Make sure that you do NOT enter a hard return at the end of this line.
  Let the line wrap as you type it and then finish it with a hard return. The
  finished batch file looks like this:

     C:\NET\net initialize
     C:\NET\netbind.com
     C:\NET\umb.com
     C:\NET\tcptsr.exe
     C:\NET\tinyrfc.exe
     C:\NET\nmtsr.exe
     C:\NET\emsbfr.exe
     rem C:\NET\net start
  C:\NET\net logon {userid} {localpassword} /domain:{ntdomainname} /yes
     /savepw:no &lt; C:\NET\password.txt

4. Save your batch file and create a new text file with the user account's
  password on the first line (the password is case sensitive) followed by a
  hard return. Save the file in the C:\NET subdirectory with the name
  PASSWORD.TXT.

5. Try running the batch file. If it does not work make sure that the the user
  and domain information are correct, then check to make sure that the MS-DOS
  client is initializing the network board and loading the protocols properly.
