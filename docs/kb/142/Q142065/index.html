-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

If you do not have network adapters, you can use a null-modem (serial) cable to
connect a Windows 95 computer to a Windows NT computer. There are two ways to
configure this connection:

- Windows NT is the host and Windows 95 is the guest

-or-

- Windows 95 is the host and Windows NT is the guest

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows NT is the Host and Windows 95 is the Guest
--------------------------------------------------

If you use Windows NT as the server, start the RAS Server Service on the Windows
NT computer and make sure the user who is connecting has RAS Dial- in
permissions. The Windows 95 guest should connect using the Direct Cable Connect
utility and should have their serial adapter configured for the same speed
connection as the Windows NT computer.

Windows 95 is the Host and Windows NT is the Guest
--------------------------------------------------

If you use a Windows 95 computer as the server, configure the Windows NT computer
with a Phonebook entry that uses the null modem 19200 speed (or whatever speed
is set on the Windows 95 computer) and dial the Windows 95 computer.

Notes
-----

Windows NT 4.0:

The serial cable device is installed/configured in the Modem utility in Control
Panel and is listed under Standard Modem Types as "Dial-Up Networking Serial
Cable between 2 PCs."

Windows NT 3.5x:

The serial cable device is installed/configured in the Remote Access Setup and is
listed as Null Modem 9600, Null Modem 19200, or Null Modem 38400.

Windows 95:

The serial cable device is configured in the System utility in Control Panel.
Click the Device Manager tab, double-click Modems, and then double- click Serial
Cable On ComX (where 'x' is the COM port where your cable is attached.) Make
sure the speed set here matches the speed of the Windows NT serial connection.
The client (guest) and server (host) must be the same for the serial connection
to work properly.


For additional information on null-modem (serial) cables, such as the proper
pin-out configuration to work with the setups above, please see the following
