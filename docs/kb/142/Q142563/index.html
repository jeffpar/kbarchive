SUMMARY
=======

Many computers cannot access more than 528 MB of data on IDE drives, which is by
design. However, some third-party software programs can allow access of data
beyond the 528 MB limit such as On Track Disk Manager. Some hardware
manufacturers have introduced enhancements to the BIOS and the IDE controllers
so that data can be virtually accessed through Logical Block Addressing (LBA).
If the hardware manufacturer of your computer does not provide this feature, you
may want to upgrade your BIOS to the Disk Extender.

For more information, contact American Megatrends, Inc., at (800) 828-9264 or
(404) 263-9381.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Most large IDE drives support LBA. One of Disk Extender's preferred requirements
is that the computer supports LBA for its IDE drives. If your computer does not
provide this support, Disk Extender uses Block Transfer Mode for the IDE drives
so that data can be accessed beyond 528 MB. Disk Extender works with any of the
Microsoft operating systems and supports up to four IDE hard drives on a
system.


The following information lists additional features of the AMI Disk Extender:

- Supports up to two IDE Controllers (primary and secondary).

- Supports up to two IDE drives (master and slave) for each IDE controller, a
  total of four IDE drives.

- Supports IDE LBA mode drives with capacities greater than 528MB.

- Needs no additional support from the system BIOS.

- Works with any system BIOS.

- Derived from AMI BIOS.

- Requires no configuration; auto detects and configures IDE drives.

The complete reference to the board is called:

- AMIDISK
  IDE BIOS Extension

  -or-

- AMI Disk Extender

The board can be purchased directly from Washburn Company, Inc. Washburn Company,
Inc. is the manufacturer of the AMI BIOS and source licenses it to AMI.
