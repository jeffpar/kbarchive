Q. How do I prepare my files for Genigraphics?

A. Follow the steps below:

  1. From the File menu, point to Send To, and then click Genigraphics.

  2. The Genigraphics Wizard walks you through each step. Be careful
     to answer all questions (for example, what output you need, your
     order, how you would like your order processed, and shipping and
     billing information).

Q. Genigraphics has a variety of outputs to choose from. What are the
  differences?

A. They include:

     35mm Slides:      Genigraphics provides high quality
                       slide imaging. They also offer Double
                       sets and Slide Duplicates.

     Color Overheads:  Genigraphics has two to choose from.
                       Colorvues are the company standard, using
                       Digital Photographic continuous tone
                       output. Qwikvues use a thermal wax process
                       at 300 dpi output. Qwikvues are better for
                       one-time presentations.

     Color Prints:     These are produced from the same two processes
                       as Color Overheads. Slick Prints use 11-by-14-
                       inch display prints or 12-by-18-inch office
                       posters and Color Handouts, which are similar
                       to the quality of the Quikvues (color
                       overheads.)

Q. What are the available shipping options?

A. They include:

     Saturday: In by 10 AM; returned by noon Monday.
     Rush: In by 7 PM; returned by noon next business day.
     Next Day: In by 1 PM; returned by noon next business day.
