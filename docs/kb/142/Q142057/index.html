SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT supports PostScript printers that uses industry-standard PostScript
Printer Description (PPD) files. Windows NT installs PPD files using
PRINTER.INF. This article provides detailed instructions on how to modify
PRINTER.INF so that you can install PPD files obtained from print device
manufacturers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install PPD files from print device manufacturers:

1. Obtain the OEMSETUP.INF from the DDK in the
  \WINNT.NT\WINNT351.DDK\DDK\SRC\SETUP\INF\PRINTER directory.
  Rename the file to PRINTER.INF.


  -or-

  Obtain PPDInst.exe from the Microsoft Download Center. For more information
  about how to obtain this file, see the "To Obtain the PPDInst.exe File"
  section at the end of this article.

2. Create a file called DISK1. The content does not matter. The Setup procedure
  only checks to make sure it exists. If you perform the installation on a
  non-Intel (x86) computer, name the file CDROM.W.

3. Copy DISK1 (or CDROM.W), the PRINTER.INF file and your PPD file to a floppy
  disk or a sub-directory on your hard disk.

4. Copy PSCRIPT.DLL, PSCRPTUI.DLL and PSCRIPT.HLP from an existing Windows NT
  installation to the floppy disk or the sub-directory on the hard disk. If you
  install support for Intel-based (x86) computers, look for these files in the
  following directory:

  %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\SPOOL\DRIVERS\W32X86\1

5. The PRINTER.INF file installs support for one particular printer: the HP
  LaserJet IIISi. To install support for your printer, do the following:

  a. Change each reference of RASDD to PSCRIPT and RASDDUI to PSCRPTUI.

  b. Modify the following section using a text editor, such as Notepad:

     [Files-PrinterData]
     hppcl5ms = 1,hppcl5ms.dll , SIZE=999

     Change the file name (for example: HPPCL5MS.DLL) to match the name of the
     PPD file of your printer. HPPCL5MS is an identifier and it does not
     require any change for your new PPD file name.

  c. If you change the identifier, you must also change it in the [Options]
     section below:

     [Options]
     "HP LaserJet IIISi" = rasddui, hppcl5ms, rasdd

     Change HP LaserJet IIISi to match the name of your printer. To determine
     the name, open the PPD file for your printer using a text editor and
     search for the NickName. If you have changed the identifier above, then
     you must change it in the following section:

     [OptionsTextENG]
     "HP LaserJet IIISi" = "OEM HP LaserJet IIISi"

6. In the [ProductType] section, make sure that STF_PLATFORM is correctly set
  for your computer, as follows:

  STF_PLATFORM = x

  where x is Mips, I386, Alpha or PPC (PowerPC).

7. If you are not installing the PPD file on an Intel-based computer, change the
  following line in the [Source Media Descriptions] section from DISK1 to
  CDROM.W:

  1 = "OEM Disk (PRINTER)" , TAGFILE = disk1

8. Start Windows NT Print Manager. From the Printer menu, select Create Printer.

9. Enter the printer name and select a port.

10. For Driver, select Other. Enter the drive and path of the printer driver
  disk (the same directory on step 3 above).

11. In the Select Driver dialog box, select the driver and click OK.

12. In the Windows NT Setup dialog box, enter the drive and path of the printer
  driver disk (the same directory on step 3 above) and click Continue.

  NOTE: If you supply the Windows NT CD-ROM path instead of supplying the
  driver disk path, the Setup program will successfully copy the PostScript
  files, and then prompt for the directory where the PPD file is located. At
  this point, the path cannot be changed back to the disk directory and will
  only accept the CD-ROM path.
