SYMPTOMS
========

With the DBList's IntegralHeight property set to True (the default) switching
back and forth between the 3D and flat versions of the DBList control (via the
Appearance property) causes the DBList control to shrink vertically, possibly
all the way to a single horizontal line.

CAUSE
=====

When the control's Appearance property is Flat, the control has a certain number
of pixels X for a certain number of rows N, as well as two extra pixels for the
border. When switched to a 3D view, the control still only uses a maximum of X+2
pixels total but now uses 4 pixels for the border, and it doesn't have enough
space left over for all N rows of data. To remedy this, the control reduces the
number of rows shown by one. Repeating this numerous times causes row after row
to be lost, until no rows are left, and the control appears as a flat line.

RESOLUTION
==========

After setting the Appearance property to the desired value, resize the control
to the desired proportions.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce
------------------

1. Start Visual Basic, or if it is already running, choose New Project from the
  File menu.

2. Click and drag a single DBList control onto the form. The IntegralHeight
  property of the control is set to True by default.

3. Repeatedly double-click on the DBList's Appearance property in the Properties
  window to toggle between the flat and 3D views of the DBList control. The
  control will shrink in size vertically, until it remains as just a single
  line on the form.
