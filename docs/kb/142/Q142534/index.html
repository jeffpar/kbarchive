SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the steps to create a new example program that uses
Remote OLE. The first example creates a client-server example illustrating use
of a 32-bit client and a 32-bit server application; the second example is of a
16-bit client communicating with a 32-bit server application.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Both examples are very simple, because the purpose of this article is to
illustrate the most basic steps to get a Remote client and server working.

In this article, the 32-bit to 32-bit example involves creating the client and
the server applications on the client workstation, and then distributing the
server application onto the server machine. However, there is no reason why the
reverse process of creating the server and client applications on the server
machine, and then creating a setup for the client could not also occur.

The 16-bit to 32-Bit example involves creating the 16-bit client and the 32- bit
server applications on the server machine, and then distributing the client
application to a workstation (clearly a 32-bit server cannot be developed on a
16-bit operating system).

32-Bit Client to 32-Bit Remote Server Example
---------------------------------------------

This example uses a 32-bit client and a 32-bit server. Both the client and the
server machines must be run on either Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 2000, or
Windows NT 3.51 (or higher)(that is, a 32-bit operating systems). In this
example, the 'client' workstation needs to have Visual Basic 4.0, 32-bit
edition, installed. A setup program is created for the server application.

STAGE 1 - CREATION OF THE SERVER APPLICATION

1. On the client workstation, start a new project in Visual Basic 4.0, 32- bit
  edition. Form1 is created by default. Insert a class module by choosing
  Insert.Class Module from the menu. In the class module, type the following
  code:

        Public Sub Test()
        Msgbox "Hi"
        End Sub

  Remove unnecessary controls from the project by choosing Tools.Custom Controls
  from the menu, and clearing all the controls. Since no controls have been
  added to the form, all check boxes in the Custom Controls list box can be
  cleared. In addition, remove all unnecessary references from the project.
  This can be accomplished by selecting Tools.References and clearing all the
  entries except for "Visual Basic For Applications," "Visual Basic objects and
  procedures," and "Standard OLE Types." This will save time later on when in
  the distribution stage for the server application.

2. Press F4 to bring up the property window for the class. Set the following
  properties:

     Name:       TestObj
     Instancing:   2 - Creatable Multiuse
     Public:      True

3. Choose Tools.Options from the menu, and choose the Project tab. Set the
  following properties:

  Project name:      TestApp

  Select the OLE Server radio button and then press the OK button to accept the
  changes.

4. Save the project files to a new directory. Now, choose File.Make EXE from the
  menu. Make the EXE in the same directory as the VBP project file. Name the
  EXE TestAapp.exe.

5. Go to Tools.Options from the menu, choose the Project tab. Choose the
  ellipsis (three dots) button contained in the right hand side of the
  "Compatible OLE Server" box, and select TestApp.exe from the dialog box.

  Although this step was not strictly necessary, it is useful because after
  selecting the "Compatible OLE Server", Visual Basic will reuse the ID for the
  server application, so that client applications that are bound to that ID
  will not break if the server application needs to be recompiled.

6. Save the project file again.

STAGE 2 - REGISTER THE SERVER APPLICATION ON THE CLIENT WORKSTATION.
7. Register the server locally by running TestApp.exe. Close down the
  application by choosing Close from the System menu on the upper-left corner
  of Form1. The action of running the server caused it to be registered
  locally.

This step is important to ensure that the server application works, and that it
correctly registers.

STAGE 3 - CREATION OF THE CLIENT APPLICATION.
8. Start a new project in Visual Basic, 32-bit edition. Form1 is created by
  default. Go to the Click event for Form1 and place the following code:

        Dim x as New TestApp.TestObj
        x.Test

9. Go to Tools.References in the menu, and check the entry for TestApp.

10. Run the Client application in the Design environment. Click on the form and
  the server application should be launched and a MsgBox should appear.

11. Stop the client application in the design environment and then close down
  the server application by choosing Close from the System menu on the still
  displayed Form1 of the server application.

12. Save the client project files to a new directory. Choose Make EXE for the
  client application - call it ClientApp.exe. Make the EXE file in the same
  location as the VBP file.

13. Exit Visual Basic and save the change to the Project file (the change was
  the location and name of the executable).

STAGE 4 - TEST THE CLIENT APPLICATION LOCALLY.
14. In Explorer in Windows 95, Windows NT 4.0, or Windows 2000, or File Manager
  in Windows NT 3.51, double- click on ClientApp.EXE. Click the Form and it
  should again launch the server and bring up a MsgBox of "Hi" if successful.
  Close down the server and client completely.

STAGE 5 - INSTALLATION OF SERVER APPLICATION ON REMOTE MACHINE
15. Choose the Visual Basic 4 32-bit Setup Wizard. Choose the TestApp.vbp
  Project file in Step 1. Do not choose the Rebuild EXE option. Choose the
  Next button. If Step 2 appears, simply choose the Next button.

16. In Step 3 of Setup Wizard you can choose to install the application to a new
  directory or to floppy disks. For Steps 4 and 5 simply choose the Next
  button.

17. In Step 6 of Setup Wizard choose the option to Install in Application
  Directory and check the box labeled:

      "Yes, install remote OLE automation server components"

  Press Next on the Setup Wizard.

18. In Step 7 press the Finish button to create the compressed files and setup
  program.

19. Go to the server machine, and run the setup program from the drive and
  directory or floppy disks where Setup Wizard placed the compressed server
  files and setup program.

  At the completion of the setup program, assuming it completed successfully,
  there should be icons for the RemAuto Connection Manager, the Automation
  Manager, the server TestApp, and an icon to uninstall the server
  application.

STAGE 6 - CONFIGURATION OF OLE SERVER APPLICATION
20. The Setup program should have registered the server application. To ensure
  it works correctly, run TestApp.exe and then close it down by choosing Close
  from the System menu of Form1.

21. Start the 32-bit Remote Automation (RemAuto) Connection Manager on the
  server. Choose the Client Access tab (this is the only tab we are concerned
  with when on the server machine; on the client machine, we are only
  concerned with the Server Connection tab).

  Highlight TestApp.TestObj and choose the "Allow all Remote Creates" option,
  press the Apply button and exit the Remote Connection Manager.

22. Start the Automation Manager.

STAGE 7 - CONFIGURATION OF CLIENT WORKSTATION
23. Start the 32-bit Remote Connection Manager on the client machine. Go to the
  Server Connection Tab.

24. Highlight TestApp.TestObj. Fill in the details for network address, protocol
  and Authentication. An example would be:

     Machine:          Machine2
     Protocol:          TCP/IP
     Authentication:       None

  Choose the Remote menu item from the Register menu. Press the Apply button
  and exit the RemAuto Connection Manager.

25. Start the Client Application via Explorer or File Manager. Click Form1 of
  the client application and a Msgbox should appear on the Remote machine.
  Click OK to close the message box and watch as the Automation Manager
  returns to 0 connection(s) to 0 object(s) when the client-side object
  reference is destroyed as the object variable goes out of scope. Shut down
  the server and the client applications.

16-Bit Client to 32-Bit Remote Server Example
---------------------------------------------

To follow through these steps, you will need Visual Basic 4.0 16-bit and 32- bit
editions installed on a workstation that is going to represent the server
machine. The server should be running either Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows
2000, or Windows NT 3.51(or higher). A setup program for the client application
is created. The client workstation can be running any operating system such as
Windows 3.1, Windows 3.11, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 2000, or Windows NT
3.51. (or higher).

STAGE 1 - CREATION OF THE SERVER APPLICATION

1. On the server workstation, start a new project in Visual Basic 4, 32- bit
  Edition.

2. Insert a class module into the Project by choosing Insert.Class Module from
  the menu and set the properties of the Class to the following:

     Instancing:    Creatable MultiUse
     Name:         RemObject
     Public:        True

  Add the following code to the class module:

        Public Sub MyMessage()
        MsgBox "Hello there"
        End Sub

3. Go to Tools.Options from the menu and choose the Project tab. Set "Project
  Name" = RemServer. Select the OLE Server radio button and press the OK
  button.

4. Choose File.Make EXE from the menu. Change the name of the program to
  RemSer.exe. Before choosing OK, choose the Options button and check the
  "Remote Server Support Files" check box. Now make the EXE file.

5. Save the project files to the same location as the EXE file.

6. Choose Tools.Options, and select the Project tab. Select the "Compatible OLE
  Server" and select the EXE file "RemSer.exe". Choose OK, and then save the
  project.

7. Exit Visual Basic 4 32-bit edition, saving changes to the files. Go to File
  Manager and run the server to ensure that it works.

STAGE 2 - CREATION OF THE CLIENT
8. On the server workstation, start Visual Basic 4, 16-bit Edition. Start a new
  project, and Form1 is created by default.

  Remove unnecessary controls from the project by choosing Tools.Custom Controls
  from the menu, and unchecking all the controls. Since no controls have been
  added to the form, all check boxes in the Custom Controls list box can be
  cleared. In addition, remove all unnecessary references from the project.
  This can be accomplished by selecting Tools.References and clearing all the
  entries except for "Visual Basic For Applications," "Visual Basic objects and
  procedures," and "Standard OLE Types." This will save time later on when in
  the distribution stage for the server application.

9. Choose Tools.. References from the menu. Check the entry for RemServer.

10. Go to the Form_Click event for Form1, and place the following code:

        Dim x As RemServer.RemObject
        Set x = New RemServer.RemObject
        x.MyMessage

11. Save the project files and make an EXE into the same directory as the
  project files for the client. From File Manager, run the client EXE on the
  server machine, click on the form and it should launch the server and bring
  up the message box. Shut down the client and server applications.

STAGE 3 - CREATION OF THE CLIENT APPLICATION SETUP PROGRAM
12. Run the 16-bit edition of the Setup Wizard. In Step 1 choose the VBP file
  for the client application--do not select the Rebuild the Project EXE
  option.

13. Choose the Next button for Step 2, and in Step 3 choose to install into a
  brand new directory. In Step4, choose the Add OLE Server button, change the
  'List Files of Type:' text box to show 'Remote OLE Servers' instead of
  'Local OLE Servers'. Locate the VBR file for the server which should be in
  the directory where the server EXE was made. It asks for details when you
  select the VBR file - type in the Network address (the Machine name), and
  choose the protocol (TCP/IP recommended). Leave Authentication at None.
  Choose OK and move on to the next step. Skip through Step 5 by choosing the
  Next button, and in Step 6 leave the default, which is "Install in
  Application Directory". Choose the Next button and in Step 7 choose the
  Finish button.

14. In File Manager, or Explorer, share the directory that contains the server
  files.

STAGE 4 - SETUP OF THE CLIENT
15. On the client connect to the shared directory on the server machine
  containing the compressed files and the setup program, and run the setup
  program to install the client application to the client machine.

STAGE 5 - TESTING IT OUT
16. Start the Automation Manager on the server.

17. Run the client and click on the client Form. You should get a Message Box on
  the server. Close the message box and shut down both the client and the
  server.

16-Bit Client to 16-Bit Remote Server
-------------------------------------

In order to construct a 16-bit to 16-bit example, exactly the same steps used for
the 16-bit client to 32-bit server example can be used, except that Stage 1 -
Creation of the Server (steps 1-7 inclusive) would take place in Visual Basic
4.0, 16-bit Edition. It is imperative to stress that the server must run on a
32-bit operating system because the Automation Manager must be running, and this
program is only available as a 32-bit application. In general, it is far
preferable to run a 32-bit server because of performance and reliability
reasons.

Troubleshooting Remote OLE Problems
-----------------------------------

This article is useful for testing if Remote OLE is working at all - if the steps
to create a new Remote OLE example above have been faithfully reproduced, and
errors still occur, then it could indicate that there is a network configuration
or other software problem. For additional troubleshooting information, please
