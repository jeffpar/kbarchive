The information in this article applies to:

- Scholastic's Magic School Bus series: Explores the Ocean for Windows, version 1.0 
- the operating system: Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to run Setup for Magic School Bus Explores the Ocean (MSB Ocean),
you receive the following error message:

  CD Audio MCI driver not installed or there is no CD present in your CD-ROM
  drive. Use the Drivers icon in Control Panel to install CD Audio MCI driver
  if it is missing. Ensure you have your CD with the Magic School Bus Explores
  the Ocean program inserted into your CD ROM drive.


This behavior has been observed with the following configuration:

- Aztech Sound card with a Panasonic (Matsushita) CD-ROM drive running under
  Windows version 3.x.

RESOLUTION
==========

Update the CD-ROM driver to use the following Panasonic driver (or later):

+------------------------------------------+
| Filename  | Size   | Date    | Time      | 
+------------------------------------------+
| CDMKE.SYS | 13,411 | 2/22/95 | 4:11:00AM | 
+------------------------------------------+

You may obtain the driver Cdmke.sys by downloading the file, 56xdos.exe from one
of the following locations:

  WWW.PANASONIC.COM/OEM-CD-R.HTML (as of 1/10/96)

  -or-

  Panasonic BBS (770) 664-1833 (Communications Protocol: 8,N,1)

NOTE: The file 56xdos.exe is a self-extracting, compressed file that, when
uncompressed, provides you with the needed driver. There is an Install.exe file
packaged in the 56xdos.exe, but you do not need to run the install program. Use
the following instructions to replace the Cr56x.sys file with the newer
Cdmke.sys file:

1. Copy the Cdmke.sys file to your drivers folder on drive C (c:\drivers), where
  C is the letter of your hard drive where you installed Windows.

2. Edit the Config.sys file with a text editor, such as Notepad, and change the
  line that contains the CD-ROM driver to the use the Cdmke.sys file. For
  example, change the following line

  Device=C:\Wavrider\Drivers\Cr56x.sys /P:340 /D:Mscd000

  to

  Device=C:\Drivers\Cdmke.sys /P:340 /D:Mscd000

  NOTE: If you receive errors when you start the computer, check the switches
  ("/" on the end of the Device line in Config.sys to make sure they specify
  the proper settings).

  For additional information, please see the manual that came with your CD-ROM
  or contact your hardware manufacturer.

3. Install and run MSB Ocean.

If the steps above do not resolve the issue, please see the following articles in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q92902 Media Player Cannot Play Audio CD If CDAudio=0 in MPLAYER.INI


If you have trouble accessing or installing the file, please contact Panasonic
(8:00 A.M. to 9:00 P. M. eastern time) at:

  (800) 890-3219

  -or-

  (770) 664-3201

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: The driver for the Panasonic CD-ROM drive is usually included with the
sound card. This is common practice because a CD-ROM drive often is connected
through the sound card to the data bus.

There may be situations when a CD-ROM driver causes Windows 3.x to misdetect the
presence of the CD-Audio MCI driver. With other configurations, do not rule out
the possibility that you may have to update your CD-ROM driver to get CD Audio
to play correctly.
