-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to run a NetWare Directory Services (NDS) tool on a computer
running Windows 95 configured with the Microsoft Service for NDS, you may
receive one of the following error messages:

- Invalid Context

- Unknown Object Type

- Cannot read object's information

- Program Error Your program is making an invalid dynamic link call to a .dll
  file

CAUSE
=====

The Novell NetWare Administrator program (Nwadmin.exe) has not been run.
Therefore, the following dynamic link libraries (DLLs) are not loaded in
memory:

- Nwcalls.dll

- Nwlocale.dll

- Nwipxspx.dll

- Nwnet.dll

- Nwgdi.dll

- Nwpsrv.dll

RESOLUTION
==========

You can edit the registry using System Policy Editor (Poledit.exe) or Registry
Editor (Regedit.exe). Check with your network administrator before you make any
changes to the registry.

System Policy Editor (Poledit.exe) is available in the Admin\Apptools\ Poledit
folder on the Windows 95 CD-ROM. Use the Add/Remove Programs tool in Control
Panel to install System Policy Editor.

NOTE: System Policy Editor is not included in the floppy disk version of Windows
95. You can download Policy.exe, a self-extracting file containing Poledit.exe,
from online services. Please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base for information about downloading Policy.exe:

  Q135315 CD-ROM Extras for Microsoft Windows 95 Upgrade

Use the following steps to edit the registry with System Policy Editor to ensure
that the necessary NetWare DLLs are automatically loaded when Windows 95
starts:

1. Click the Start button, and then click Run.

2. Type "poledit" (without the quotation marks) in the Open box, and then click
  OK.

3. On the Options menu, click Template.

4. Click Open Template, type the full path for the Maple.adm file that is
  included with the Microsoft Service for NDS, click Open, and then click
  Close.

5. On the File menu, click Open Registry, and then double-click Local Computer.

6. Double-click Network, and then double-click Service For NetWare Directory
  Services.

7. Click the Load NetWare DLLs At Startup check box to select it, and then click
  OK.

8. Save the changes to the registry, exit System Policy Editor, and then restart
  Windows 95.

After you complete the above steps, the following DLLs are loaded automatically
each time you start Windows 95:

- Nwcalls.dll

- Nwlocale.dll

- Nwnet.dll

NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should
make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you
edit the registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

To cause the Nwipxspx.dll, Nwgdi.dll, and Nwpsrv.dll DLLs to be loaded
automatically each time you start Windows 95, you must create a new string value
for each DLL that you want to be loaded under the following registry key:

  Hkey_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Nwnp32\ 
  NetworkProvider\PreloadDlls

The name of each new string value should be the name of the DLL that you want to
be loaded automatically. For example, if you want the Nwipxspx.dll DLL to be
loaded automatically, the name of the new string value that you create should be
"Nwipxspx.dll" (without quotation marks). The new registry values that you
create should not be assigned any data.
