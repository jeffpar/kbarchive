SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to print Fish Cards, the Divers License, and Certificates of
Completion to a Canon Bubble Jet 660C or 610 printer from Magic School Bus
Explores the Ocean (MSB Ocean), they never print.

This behavior may also occur in MSB Explores the Human Body and MSB Explores
Inside the Earth.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the Canon driver consumes a large amount of memory.
This contributes to an insufficiency of memory when you try to print the
graphic.

RESOLUTION
==========

Epson LQ printer drivers do not consume memory the way the Canon driver does. To
resolve the printing problems, install the Epson LQ 860 or LQ 2550 driver to use
with your Canon printer.

To install the driver, use the instructions below for your version of Windows:

Windows 95/98
-------------

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. With your right mouse button, click the Bubble Jet 660C, and then click
  Properties.

3. Click the Details tab.

4. Click New Driver. A warning appears that says if you change the printer
  driver, the changes are saved. Click Yes.

5. In the list of Manufacturers click Epson. Then, from the list of Models,
  click LQ 860 or LQ 2550.

MSB Ocean should now print successfully. NOTE: This problem may also be corrected
by disabling Print Spooling for the Canon BJC 600 or 610 printer driver. The
print spooling option is found on the Details tab of the Printer Properties. For
more information about print spooling, please see your printer documentation.

Windows 3.x
-----------

1. In Program Manager, double click the Control Panel, usually located in the
  Main program group.

2. Double-click Printers.

3. Click Add.

4. Select the Epson LQ 860 or LQ 2550, and click Install.

5. Insert the appropriate Windows setup disk when you are prompted, and press
  ENTER.

6. Make sure the port is set to the same port as the Canon Printer.

7. Make sure the Epson driver is selected, and then click Set As Default.

MSB Ocean should now print successfully.
