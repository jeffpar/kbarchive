Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) versions 7.00
and 7.10 introduce support for static arrays in user-defined TYPE
definitions. This means that you can write an entire array (in a user
TYPE record) to a disk file at once. The code example below writes an
entire array to a RANDOM or BINARY file using a single PUT# statement.

Note that you cannot output arrays all at once (in one PRINT# or
WRITE# statement) to files opened with sequential access (OPEN FOR
OUTPUT). With sequential access (OPEN FOR OUTPUT or INPUT), you must
output or input just one array element at a time.

You must use RANDOM or BINARY access to write a static
nonvariable-length string array to a file all at once (as shown in the
examples below).

Note that in Microsoft QuickBASIC versions 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50 for
MS-DOS, in Microsoft BASIC Compiler versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS
and MS OS/2, and in Microsoft BASIC PDS versions 7.00 and 7.10 for
MS-DOS and MS OS/2, you can directly write whole records (variables)
of a given user-defined TYPE to disk as the third argument of the PUT#
statement. Each and every element of the user-defined TYPE record is
automatically copied to the file. If the data is numeric and you
output to a file OPENed with RANDOM or BINARY access, the data is
automatically stored in numeric format (without requiring a lengthy
FIELD statement or numeric-to-string conversion functions such as
MKS$, MKD$, MKI$, or MKL$).

Since an array can be an element of a record of user-defined TYPE in
BASIC 7.00 and 7.10 (but not in earlier versions), you can write a
whole array at once into a disk file, as shown below.

Code Example
------------

The following example, compiled in BASIC PDS 7.00 or 7.10, shows how
to write a whole array to disk at once, using just one PUT# statement:

TYPE rec1
  array1(20) AS INTEGER
END TYPE
DIM var1 AS rec1, var2 AS rec1  'DIMension var1 &amp; var2 with TYPE rec1
FOR i = 1 TO 20      ' Fill each element of the array:
  var1.array1(i) = i
NEXT

' The following OPEN statements may OPEN FOR either RANDOM or BINARY:
OPEN "test.dat" FOR RANDOM AS #1
PUT #1, , var1       ' Write whole array to disk all at once.
CLOSE

OPEN "test.dat" FOR RANDOM AS #1
GET #1, , var2      ' Reads array all at once into var2.
FOR i = 1 TO 20     ' Print the contents of the array var2.array1:
  PRINT var2.array1(i);
NEXT
CLOSE
