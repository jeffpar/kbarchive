Question:

I have read the MTDYNA.DOC file regarding the use of the multithreaded
libraries with a multithreaded application. However, I am unclear as
to the exact meaning of the following passage:

   C run-time global data (such as the standard I/O package FILE,
   pointers of buffer I/O, and memory allocated with malloc functions)
   is shared. This means that the program and the associated
   dynamic-link libraries must cooperate on the usage of this data.

What cooperation is required between the application and the DLLs? Does
this mean that I should put all the functions that use this global
data in a single thread and call the functions serially?

For example, suppose one thread in the DLL calls printf(), and while
that is executing, the application calls fprintf(). Will the two
functions use the same global data area to do their respective data
manipulations? Is it necessary use semaphores around all the functions
that use each malloc'ed memory pointer or all functions that access
FILE pointers?

Response:

There are really two parts to this answer:

1. The run-time library takes care of the synchronization of various
   threads that use a particular function. So, in the case of internal
   data a run-time function may need, the data sharing is controlled
   by the library. There is no need for the user of the library to
   worry about that.

2. The second part has to deal with the global data that the
   application and the DLL share. The passage in MTDYNA.DOC is
   attempting to say that the DLL and the application have to
   cooperate on the creation, using, and termination of the global
   data.

Take FILE pointers, for instance. If the DLL issues a fcloseall(), all
file handles that belong to the ENTIRE process will be closed. If the
application or other DLLs are still using a particular file pointer,
that has to be coordinated before the fclosealll() is issued.

Along the same lines, if multiple threads write to the same file
handle at the same time, all the writes will go out in the order they
are received by the run time. This is due to the internal
synchronization of the run time mentioned above and does not require
any user intervention. However, all the data is written one after
another in the same file. This may or may not be the desired result.

The same scenario holds true for the other global run-time data.
