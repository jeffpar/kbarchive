In SCREEN 1, the COLOR statement cannot be used to put text of more
than one color on the screen at one time. However, this can be done by
using the ROM BIOS INTERRUPT hex 10, function 9, which displays a
character with a specified attribute at the current cursor position.

This information applies to Microsoft QuickBASIC Versions 2.00, 2.01,
3.00, 4.00, 4.00b, 4.50 for MS-DOS, to Microsoft BASIC Compiler
Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS and MS OS/2, and to Microsoft BASIC
Professional Development System (PDS) Version 7.00 for MS-DOS and MS
OS/2.

The specified attribute of a character can be 0, 1, 2, or 3. This
attribute and the COLOR statement determine the color of the
character. When an even expression (0 to 254) is the value for the
palette in the COLOR statement, the default colors are 1 (green), 2
(red), and 3 (yellow on CGA, or brown on EGA). When an odd expression
(1 to 255) is the value for the palette in the COLOR statement, the
default colors are 1 (cyan), 2 (magenta), and 3 (white). When the
attribute is 0, the character is the background color specified by the
COLOR statement. Attribute 0 can be used to erase a character. If no
COLOR statement is used, the default is COLOR 0,1.

The following program CALLs INTERRUPT 10 Hex (16 decimal), with
function 9, to display a character of a certain color on the screen.
To use this program, do the following:

1. Invoke QuickBASIC by typing the following:

      QB /L QB.QLB       [for QuickBASIC 4.00, 4.00b, or 4.50]
   or
      QBX /L QBX.QLB     [for BASIC PDS Version 7.00]

   (The /L option above loads the QB.QLB or QBX.QLB Quick library,
   which contains the CALL INTERRUPT routine.)

2. QB.BI must be used in the $INCLUDE metacommand (see below). QB.BI
   contains the user-defined TYPEs RegTypeX and RegType. Refer to the
   QB.BI text file for more information. For BASIC PDS 7.00, this file
   is called QBX.BI.

3. If you are compiling and linking outside the environment, QB.LIB
   must be linked in. For BASIC PDS 7.00, you must link in QBX.LIB.

This program allows text to be printed to the screen at the location
of the cursor by CALLing a subprogram named PrintColors. The text,
attribute, and row and column position of the cursor are passed.

DECLARE SUB PrintColors (text$, attribute, col, row)
' $INCLUDE: 'qb.bi'
' For BASIC PDS you must include 'qbx.bi'
DIM SHARED inregs AS RegType, outregs AS RegType
CLS
SCREEN 1
COLOR 0, 0                   'black background and even palette
col = 1: row = 1             'current position of the cursor
attribute = 1
CALL PrintColors("green text ", attribute, col, row)
attribute = 2

CALL PrintColors("red text ", attribute, col, row)
attribute = 3

CALL PrintColors("yellow/brown text", attribute, col, row)
PRINT "Default is yellow on CGA, brown on EGA"
END

REM Subprogram PrintColors prints text to the screen at position col
REM and row in a color determined by the attribute passed and the
REM palette selected by the COLOR statement. The cursor is updated.

SUB PrintColors (text$, attribute, col, row)
  FOR i = 1 TO LEN(text$)
    inregs.ax = &amp;H900 + ASC(MID$(text$, i, 1)) 'function 09 in the
                              'high part of the register and the ASCII
                              'code of a character in the low part
    inregs.bx = attribute 'display page (0 is the current page) in the
                          'high part and the attribute in the low part
    inregs.cx = &amp;H1         'number of times to display the character
    CALL Interrupt(&amp;H10, inregs, outregs)
    col = col + 1        'relocate the cursor one place to the right
    LOCATE row, col      'for every character written to the screen
  NEXT
END SUB
