This article describes Designer Quickwindows (from Software
Interphase, Inc.), an add-on product for Microsoft QuickBASIC Version
4.50 and Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS.
This product provides an alternative method of producing a Graphical
User Interface (GUI) in a BASIC program. It can be used instead of
hand coding your own interface or instead of using the User Interface
(UI) Toolbox routines provided with Microsoft BASIC Professional
Development System (PDS) Version 7.00. The product described here is
manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance
or reliability.

Software Interphase, Inc. provides a product called "Designer
Quickwindows," which is a mouse-driven design interface that generates
BASIC code. This code can then be enhanced with other BASIC code to
create a full BASIC program. The code generated creates the GUI by
making calls into the "Quick Windows Advanced Library." This library
is another product available from Software Interphase.

At the present time, Designer Quickwindows works under Microsoft
QuickBASIC Versions 4.50 and earlier and under Microsoft BASIC
Compiler Versions 6.00b and earlier. In the near future, Designer
Quickwindows should have a version that supports far strings with
Microsoft BASIC PDS 7.00. You can obtain a sample program by calling
Software Interphase (see below).

The following information was taken from Page 15 of the "Language
Support Directory for Microsoft QuickBASIC and Microsoft BASIC
Compiler":

[The "Language Support Directory for Microsoft QuickBASIC and BASIC
Compiler" is a pamphlet distributed with Microsoft BASIC Compiler
Versions 6.00 and 6.00b, but not with QuickBASIC packages. QuickBASIC
owners can order it (free) from Microsoft Sales/Consumer Response by
calling (800) 426-9400 or (206) 882-8088.]
