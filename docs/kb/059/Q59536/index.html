The following is extracted from Ray Duncan's "Advanced OS/2
Programming," Page 737:

   Module definition (DEF) files are simple ASCII text files that are
   interpreted by the linker during the construction of an application
   program, dynlink library, or device driver. The directives in DEF
   files cause information to be built into the executable file's
   header, which is later interpreted by the system when the program,
   library, or driver is loaded.

   Enter all DEF file directives and keywords in uppercase letters.
   File, segment, group, and procedure names can be lowercase or
   uppercase. Lines beginning with a semicolon (;) are treated as
   comments.

   Figure E-1. DEF file directives documented in Appendix E
   --------------------------------------------------------

   CODE        Assigns characteristics to code segments
   DATA        Assigns characteristics to data segments
   DESCRIPTION Embeds text in executable file
   EXETYPE     Specifies host operating system
   EXPORTS     Names functions exported for dynamic linking by other
               programs
   HEAPSIZE    Specifies initial size of local heap (C programs only)
   IMPORTS     Names functions that will be dynamically linked at load
               time
   LIBRARY     Builds dynlink library or device driver
   NAME        Builds application program
   OLD         Specifies ordinal compatibility with previous version of
               dynlink library
   PROTMODE    Flags file as executable in protected mode only
   REALMODE    Allows file to be executed in real mode
   SEGMENTS    Assigns characteristics to selected segments
   STACKSIZE   Specifies size of stack used by primary thread
   STUB        Embeds MS-DOS-compatible program in new executable file

For further information, refer to Appendix E, Module Definition File
Syntax, in "Advanced OS/2 Programming" or Chapter 19, Using Module-
Definition Files, in the "Microsoft FORTRAN CodeView and Utilities
User's Guide," packaged with FORTRAN Version 5.00.
