SYMPTOMS
========

In the following scenario, duplicate attachments are created when users are
using Microsoft Outlook:

1. User A sends a recurring meeting request to User B with attachment 1.

2. User B accepts this meeting.

3. User A edits an occurrence of the meeting and replaces attachment 1 with
  attachment 2.

4. User A sends an updated meeting request to User B. .

5. Collaboration Data Objects (CDO) code is run against User B's Inbox. CDO gets
  the meeting request and calls the GetAssociatedAppointment() function, and
  then calls the Update function on the appointment.

6. User B opens his Outlook calendar. All occurrences of the appointment have
  both attachments.

If you replace step 5 with the following action

  User B opens his Outlook Inbox and accepts the updated meeting request

the one edited occurrence of the meeting has attachment 2 only and the other
occurrences have attachment 1 only. CDO should work the same way.
