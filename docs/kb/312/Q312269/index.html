-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP4 
- Microsoft Outlook 2002 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After Microsoft Outlook 2002 receives a meeting request in the Inbox, Outlook
2002 may create a duplicate calendar appointment. If a Collaboration Data
Objects (CDO) application calls GetAssociatedAppointment and places a meeting in
your calendar first, and then you click the meeting request in Outlook 2002 to
open it, a duplicate appointment is created. Outlook 2000 does not create
duplicate appointments in this scenario.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if CDO was not updated to reflect the way that Outlook
2002 uses index PR_OWNER_APPT_ID to determine duplicate appointments.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: CDO

+---------------------------------------------------------+
| File name | Version     | Date        | Time  | Size    | 
+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Cdo.dll   | 5.5.2655.65 | 07-Nov-2001 | 10:34 | 801,404 | 
+---------------------------------------------------------+

NOTE: Due to file dependencies, this hotfix requires Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 4.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To ensure that conflicting appointments are not created, the CDO application
should delete the meeting request from the Inbox after processing the meeting
request.
