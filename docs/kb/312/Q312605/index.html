-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 Professional Edition 
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are playing Flight Simulator 2002, and you want to view the Navigation
Charts while in flight, there is no way to view the charts.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because the charts cannot be viewed from within Flight
Simulator.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, use one of the following methods.

Method 1: Print the Chart
-------------------------

1. Start Windows Explorer.

2. Browse to: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\FS2002\Charts.

3. Double-click the chart that you want to print.

4. On the File menu, click Print.

Method 2: View the Chart in a Seperate Window
---------------------------------------------

1. With Flight Simulator running, start Windows Explorer and browse to
  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\FS2002\Charts.

2. Double-click the chart that you want to view.

3. Tile the windows so that you can view the chart and Flight Simulator at the
  same time.

Method 3: Manually Extract Charts 
---------------------------------

The Compact installation does not install Charts. You have to extract them
manually. To do this:

NOTE: These steps assume that you have WinZip installed on your computer. To
obtain WinZip, browse to the following WinZip Computing Inc. Web site:

  http://www.winzip.com

1. Insert the Flight Simulator into the CD-ROM disk 1. Press and hold down SHIFT
  as you insert the CD-ROM to prevent the program from starting automatically.

2. Click Start, and then click Run.

3. In the Open box, type the following line, and then click OK:

  "&lt;cd-rom&gt;:\Charts.cab" (without the quotation marks)

  where &lt;cd-rom&gt; is the drive letter of your CD-ROM drive.

4. This opens the cab file in either Windows Compressed Folder or a program like
  WinZip.

5. Extract the charts (JPEG Files) to C:\Program Files\Microsoft
  Games\FS2002\Charts or another folder.

MORE INFORMATION

SimCharts sample charts. For information about how to obtain the full Jeppesen
product, see the following Jeppesen Web site:
