The information in this article applies to:

- Scholastic's Magic School Bus series: Explores in the Age of Dinosaurs for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Setup, you may receive the following error message:

  MSB Setup32 caused an error in MSVFW32.DLL

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if either of the following files is damaged, missing, or of
the incorrect version.

  Msvfw32.dll
  Msvideo.dll

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, rename the Msvfw32.dll and Msvideo.dll files, and then
extract new copies of these files from your original Microsoft Windows compact
disc (CD) (or from the \Windows\Install\Options or \Windows\Install\Cabs folder)
to the Windows\System folder on your hard disk. To do this, follow these steps.

Rename the Msvfw32.dll and Msvideo.dll Files
--------------------------------------------

1. Insert your Microsoft Windows 98 or Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition (Me)
  Startup disk into the floppy disk drive of your computer, and then restart
  your computer.

  NOTE: If you do not have a Windows 98 or Windows Me Startup disk, click the
  appropriate link below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q186300 How to Create a Windows 98 Startup Disk from MS-DOS

  Q267287 How to Create a Startup Disk in Windows Me

2. When the Windows 98 or Windows Me Startup menu appears, select "Start
  computer with CD-ROM Support".

3. Make a note of the drive letter of your CD-ROM drive, for example, E:.

4. At the command prompt, type the following lines and press ENTER after each
  line:

  C:
  cd Windows\System

5. Rename the Msvfw32.dll and Msvideo.dll files file by using the .old
  extension. To do this, type the following lines and press ENTER after each
  line:

  ren msvfw32.dll msvfw32.old
  ren msvideo.dll msvideo.old

Extract New Copies of the Msvfw32.dll and Msvideo.dll Files
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Insert your Windows 98 or Windows Me compact disc (CD) into the CD-ROM or
  DVD-ROM drive.

2. At the command prompt, type the following lines and press ENTER after each
  line:

  A:
  ext

3. At the "Please enter the path to the Windows CAB files (a:)" prompt, type
  "&lt;drive&gt;:\win98" (without the quotation marks) (if you are running
  Windows 98) or type "&lt;drive&gt;:\win9x" (without the quotation marks) (if
  you are running Windows Me), where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter of your
  CD-ROM drive, and then press ENTER. For example, type:

  E:\win98

  -or-

  E:\win9x

NOTE: If you have an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) installation of
Windows, the installation files may also be located in one of the following
folders

  &lt;C&gt;:\Windows\Options\Cabs (for Windows 98)
  &lt;C&gt;:\Windows\Options\Install (for Windows Me)

where &lt;C&gt; is the drive on which Windows is installed.

If these files are on your computer, you do not need your Windows CD because you
can extract the files from the appropriate folder on your hard disk. For
example, for Windows Me, type "C:\Windows\Options\Install" (without the
quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

4. At the "Please enter the name(s) of the files(s) you want to extract" prompt,
  type "msvfw32.dll msvideo.dll" (without the quotation marks), and then press
  ENTER.

5. At the "Please enter the path to extract to ("Enter" for current directory)"
  prompt, type "C:\Windows\System" (without the quotation marks), and then
  press ENTER.

6. At the "Is this okay? (y/n)" prompt, type "Y" (without the quotation marks),
  and then press ENTER.

7. Remove your Windows 98 or Windows Me Startup disk, and then restart your
  computer.

8. Run Setup for Magic School Bus Explores in the Age of Dinosaurs.
