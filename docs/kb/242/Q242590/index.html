MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 28: No Mail Messages In Lesson02 Folder
--------------------------------------------

There is an error in the steps on page 28.

Step 11 instructs you to "Drag the practice e-mail mesage files, indicated by
envelope icons, from the Lesson 02 folder..."

These files do not exist in the Lesson02 folder. There is no other reference to
email in the rest of the lesson.

Step 11 should be removed from page 28 and the remaining steps should be numbered
accordingly.


Page 30: Date Should Be 2005 Rather Than 2004
---------------------------------------------

On page 30, in Step 2, in the "Go to a date far in the future" section, 9/17/2004
is a Friday, not a Saturday. The note in the margin references 2005 rather than
2004.

Change:
"In the Date box, type or select the date 09-17-04 and click OK.

The Appointment area and the Date Navigator now display the date: Saturday,
September 17, 2004."

To:
"In the Date box, type or select the date 09-17-05 and click OK.

The Appointment area and the Date Navigator now display the date: Saturday,
September 17, 2005."


Page 56: Editing E-mail Using Word
----------------------------------

On page 56, the instruction in the "important" box is in error.

Selecting the "Use Microsoft Word To edit e-mail messages" checkbox in the
Message format area grays out the Signature options.

The "Use Microsoft Word to edit e-mail messages" selection must be unchecked to
add an electronic signature.


Page 60: "Workgroup Only" Icon Is Missing
-----------------------------------------

The "Workgroup Only" icon is missing from the margin of page 60. The steps
outlined in the section "Retracting an E-mail Message That You've Sent By
Mistake" will only work if Outlook is set up in Workgroup Mode.


Page 86: Missing Steps In Lesson 4 Quick Reference
--------------------------------------------------

On page 86, under the Lesson 4 Quick Reference item "Forward e-mail messages to
another person immediately upon receipt", the final steps necessary to complete
this task are missing from the "Do this" column.

Add the following steps to the end of the process in the "Do this" column:

Check the box for Forward. Select who to forward the email to. Click OK.


Page 91: "Workgroup Only" Icon Is Missing
-----------------------------------------

The "Workgroup Only" icon is missing from the margin of page 91. The procedures
outlined in steps 12-15 will only work if Outlook is set up in Workgroup Mode.


Page 101: Incorrect Screenshot and Wording
------------------------------------------

On page 101, the screenshot and the wording of steps 4 and 5 are incorrect for
the exercise.

In Steps 4 and 5:

Change:
"Company Main Phone"

To:
"Company"

The screen shot on page 101 should show a "Company" field added, not "Company
Main Phone".


Page 120: No Fax Number In Practice Recipient
---------------------------------------------

The steps in Lesson 6 include selecting Rolf Ahern's Business Fax number. Rolf
Ahern does not have a Business Fax number.

Manually adding a Business Fax number to Rolf Ahern's contact card will allow
completion of Lesson 6.


Page 200: Word "Circle" Should Be "Click"
-----------------------------------------

On page 200, under "View responses to a task request", step 3 incorrectly reads
"Circle the Close button."

Change:
"Circle the Close button."

To:
"Click on the Close button."


Page 216: Incorrect Date
------------------------

On page 216, Step 1, "Create a Recurring Appointment", incorrectly shows December
13, 2004, as a Tuesday.

Change:
"December 13, 2000"

To:
"December 14, 2000"


Page 233: There Is No Step 10
-----------------------------

On Page 233, in the box titled "important", reference is made to step 10. There
is no step 10. This reference is to step 6.

Change:
"step 10"

To:
"step 6"
