SUMMARY
=======

This article outlines the basic steps to follow when building a distribution for
a SnapIn project developed with the MMC SnapIn Designer for Visual Basic using
the Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW). There is an assumption that a SnapIn
project has already been developed and built properly. For more information on
how to build a SnapIn project, please refer to the "References" section below.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps To Package a SnapIn Project
---------------------------------

1. Start the Package and Deployment Wizard.

2. When the PDW loads, click Browse and locate the SnapIn project file on the
  system (VBP file).

3. When the proper project has been located, click Package.

4. The PDW presents the Package Type dialog box. For this example select the
  Standard Setup Package option and click Next .

5. The PDW presents the Package Folder dialog box. This option specifies where
  the finished package will reside. By default, the PDW creates a package
  folder under the project folder. In this example accept the default and click
  Next. The PDW prompts about creating a Folder that does not exist. This
  behavior is by design.

6. The PDW might display the following dialog box next:

  If this control will be used within a design environment other than Visual
  Basic, you will need to distribute the Property Page DLL. Do you want to
  include this file in your package?

  A SnapIn project is compiled as an .ocx file, and the PDW thinks the project
  is an ActiveX UserControl project. Select No to this question.

7. The PDW displays the Included Files dialog box. The Mssnaor.dll component
  should be included. If it is not, browse for the component and add it to the
  list. If there are additional files (readme file, etc) which need to be
  distributed this is where they are added to the package. Notice that the
  Msstkprp.dll should not be selected. When everything is set, click Next.

8. The PDW display the Cab Options dialog box. For this example, accept the
  default Single Cab option and click Next button.

9. The PDW displays the Installation Title dialog box. For this example, accept
  the default title and click Next.

10. The PDW displays the Start Menu Items dialog box. A SnapIn project should
  not add itself to the Start Menu unless there are additional files which
  ship (such as a readme file). When everything has been set, click Next.

11. The PDW displays the Install Location dialog box. The list shows where
  important components are installed on the target machine. Make sure that the
  Mssnapr.dll component is installed in the Program Files\Common
  Files\Microsoft Shared\SnapInDesigner folder. When everything is set, click
  Next.

12. The PDW displays the Shared Files dialog box. For this example simply click
  Next.

13. The PDW displays the Finished! dialog box. The option to save all the above
  taken options in a script file is presented. Click Finish and the PDW builds
  the distribution package.

Notes
-----

  1. A SnapIn developed with the MMC SnapIn Designer For Visual Basic requires
     the Visual Basic runtime files as well as the SnapIn runtime component
     (Mssnapr.dll). The PDW automatically includes these components in the
     distribution package.

  2. If the SnapIn project uses any ActiveX controls, confirm they are included
     with the distribution package. The PDW picks these dependencies up.

  3. The PDW does not pick up on implicit dependencies (late bound objects)
     which can cause problems when the SnapIn is executed on the target
     computer. For example, late binding to the File System Object, which is
     contained in the Scrrun.dll. The SnapIn project file (VBP) does not
     contain a reference to the component, and the Scripting Runtime is not
     included in the distribution package. If the Scripting Runtime is not
     installed on the target computer a 429 error occurs when the SnapIn tried
     to create the File System Object.
