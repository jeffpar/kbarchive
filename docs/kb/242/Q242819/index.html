The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 Professional Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to refuel your aircraft in Microsoft Flight Simulator
2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To refuel your aircraft, use one of the following methods.

Unlimited Fuel
--------------

With the exception of certain lessons and adventures, the unlimited fuel option
in Flight Simulator 2000 is enabled by default.

To increase the realism of your flying experience, you can configure your
aircraft to fly with a limited amount of fuel.

To turn the unlimited fuel option on or off:

1. Start a new flight in Flight Simulator 2000.

2. On the Aircraft menu, click Realism Settings.

3. To turn unlimited fuel off, click to clear the "Unlimited fuel" check box.

  To turn unlimited fuel on, click to select the "Unlimited fuel" check box.

4. Click the green check mark to return to the cockpit.

Automatic Refueling
-------------------

To automatically refuel your aircraft in Flight Simulator 2000, taxi your
aircraft onto a fuel square at an airport, and then bring the aircraft to a
complete stop next to the fuel pump.

A fuel square is a location at an airport where you can automatically refuel your
aircraft. Fuel squares are located at most airports in Flight Simulator 2000. A
fuel square is typically displayed as a yellow square painted on the ground, and
it may also include a red fuel pump with a "MicroGas" or "MicroPetrol" label.

NOTE: In some cases, a fuel square may not be displayed properly. This can occur
if airport objects are not rendered in the proper order, or if the fuel square
is located on sloping terrain. In either case, the fuel square still works, if
you can find it.

If the fuel pump is not visible, park your aircraft in the fuel square, next to
the normal fuel pump location. You do not need to turn off your engines, but you
must bring your aircraft to a complete stop.

NOTE: The Sopwith Camel can be a challenging aircraft to refuel because it has no
brakes. This makes it extremely difficult to stop the aircraft on a fuel square
or next to a fuel pump.

Manual Refueling
----------------

You can also use the Fuel dialog box to refuel your aircraft manually in Flight
Simulator 2000. You can do this at any time, regardless of the location of your
aircraft.

To use the Fuel dialog box to refuel your aircraft:

1. On the Aircraft menu, click Fuel.

2. Under the % column, the Gallons column, or the Pounds column, click the row
  for the tank that you want to refuel, and then type the amount of fuel that
  you want.

3. Repeat step 2 to refuel any other tanks that you want to refuel.

4. Click the green check mark to return to the cockpit.
