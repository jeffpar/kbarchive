Ordering the SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 3 CD
----------------------------------------------

Microsoft SNA Server 4.0 U.S. Service Pack 3 (SP3) is available in CD 
media format by ordering the following part number from Microsoft at 
(800) 936-3500:

 #211-00339    SNA Svr 4.0 English Patch CD SP3

Downloading SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 3
------------------------------------------

Self-extracting executable files containing updated 4.0 SP3 SNA Server 
and client files can be downloaded electronically from www.microsoft.com, 
which points to:

ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/sna-public/fixes/sna40/ussp3

The following files comprise the updated SNA Server and client files for
SNA Server 4.0 SP3:

 40SP3TXT.EXE  - 4.0 SP3 Release Notes and Help File
 40SP3IS.EXE   - 4.0 SP3 Server Update (Intel) (NOTE 1,2)
 40SP3AS.EXE   - 4.0 SP3 Server Update (Alpha) (NOTE 1,2)
 40SP3IC.EXE   - 4.0 SP3 Windows NT Client Update (Intel) (NOTE 2)
 40SP3AC.EXE   - 4.0 SP3 Windows NT Client Update (Alpha) (NOTE 2)
 40SP39X.EXE   - 4.0 SP3 Windows 9X Client Update (NOTE 2)
 40SP3CLR.EXE  - 4.0 SP3 Windows 3.x, MS-DOS, WEB Client Refresh (NOTE 3)
 40SP3IHS.EXE  - 4.0 SP3 Host Security Refresh (Intel)
 40SP3AHS.EXE  - 4.0 SP3 Host Security Refresh (Alpha)
 40SP3MQ.EXE   - 4.0 SP3 MSMQ-MQSeries Bridge

All of these files are self extracting Win32 executables.

For information about changes and new features implemented in 4.0 SP3, 
see the SNASP.HLP file and README.TXT release notes file included in 
40SP3TXT.EXE, 40SP3IS.EXE or 40SP3AS.EXE.  SNASP.HLP describes symptoms
and causes for problems fixed in the service pack, as well as fixes
implemented in SNA Server 4.0 SP1 and 4.0 SP2.

NOTE 1: The SNA Server 4.0 SP3 includes updates to the SNA Server, Print
Service, COM Transaction Integrator, SNA OLE/DB Interface, TN3270 Service,
TN5250 Service, AFTP, and Shared Folders Gateway.

NOTE 2: Once the 4.0 SP3 update is applied, there is no way to uninstall 
(or "roll back") the service pack without reinstalling the previous 
SNA Server 4.0 release. The SNA Server, Windows 95 and Windows NT client 
update programs automatically invoke the MDAC installation program, 
required by SNA Server 4.0 SP3, regardless of what is currently installed 
on the server or client. Unlike SNA 4.0 SP1, the required MDAC and MMC 
files are already included in these self extracting images. Also, unlike
SNA 4.0 SP2, the SNA SDK files are included in these self extracting 
images and will be automatically upgraded as a part of running Update.

NOTE 3: The SNA Server Windows 3.x, and MS-DOS clients are still 
unchanged from SNA 4.0 SP1. There is no update installer for these 
clients. The Web-installable clients has been updated in SNA 4.0 SP3.

Instructions for Decompressing the Server or Client Update Files
----------------------------------------------------------------

The SNA Server and client update files automatically extract and run 
the Update program. When extracted, these files require the following 
free disk space:

 Server Update (Intel) - 40SP3IS.EXE:  166 MB
 Server Update (Alpha) - 40SP3AS.EXE:  197 MB
 Windows NT Client Update (Intel) - 40SP3IC.EXE: 116 MB
 Windows NT Client Update (Alpha) - 40SP3AC.EXE: 150 MB
 Windows 95 Client Update         - 40SP39X.EXE: 52 MB

Microsoft recommends that these files are extracted to a persistent,
shared network location and made available to server and client computers
across the network. Users can then connect to this shared directory and
install the service pack by running the Update program from this network
location.  To do this, perform the following steps:

1) Extract the desired service pack files to one or more directories
  on a network server:

These files can be extracted to a separate directory by using the /x or
/X option. For example:

  40SP3IS /x

2) Share the desired service pack files to network users

The full directory structure of the extracted files must be available to
the user who runs the Update program, since the Update program automatically
spawns the MDAC and MMC installation programs.  For example, "40SP3IS /X" 
will extract into the following directory structure:

  \ 
  \I386\... (SNA Server 4.0 SP3 files)
  \MMC      (MMC installation)
  \MDAC     (MS DAC installation)
  \REG2UDL  (utility used by Setup)

Similarly, the SNA Windows NT Intel client update (40SP3IC.EXE) extracts 
into the following directory structure:

 \ 
 \CLIENTS\WINNT\I386  (SNA Server 4.0 SP3 Windows NT client files)
 \MMC                 (MMC installation)
 \MDAC                (MS DAC installation)
 \REG2UDL             (utility used by Setup)

3. Users must run the Update program to install the service pack

To apply the service pack, the UPDATE should be run from the appropriate 
shared directory:

SNA Server (Intel):  \I386
SNA Server (Alpha):  \ALPHA 
SNA Windows NT client (Intel):  \CLIENTS\WINNT\I386
SNA Windows NT client (Alpha):  \CLIENTS\WINNT\ALPHA
SNA Windows 9x client: \CLIENTS\WIN9X

**********************************************************************
WARNING: The UPDATE.EXE program should always be used to install the 
service pack, which automatically spawns the Setup program in "quiet" 
mode, and requires limited user interaction. The Setup program should 
not be run directly, since the user will be required to select the 
existing installation path, user credentials and components to install. 
If these options are chosen incorrectly, this can damage the 
installation of the service pack on the destination machine.
**********************************************************************

If the self-extracting files are run without the /X option, the update
program will be run automatically. When running Update automatically, 
all files are automatically extracted to the directory where the TMP, 
TEMP, or WINROOT environment variable is pointing (trying in that order). 
So, if the SET command shows that TMP=C:\TMP , and C: does not have 
sufficient storage to extract the files, change TMP to point to a 
drive which has sufficient space.  For example:

   SET TMP=D:\TEMP

NOTE: Once Update has completed, the SNA Server source installation 
directory will point to the directory where Update was run. If SNA Setup
is run from SNA Server program group, Setup will attempt to locate this
directory when adding or removing SNA Server components.

For more information about the service pack installation process and 
possible errors that might occur, see the "More Information" section 
below.

How To Disable the MDAC Installation
------------------------------------
The 4.0 SP3 Update program for SNA Server, Windows NT and Windows 9x will
automatically spawn the MDAC installation program whenever Update is run.
This new version of MDAC must be installed so that the new data access
features of 4.0 SP3 will function properly. If these data access features
are not being used, the automatic MDAC installation can be disabled by
modifying the client SNASETUP.INI file from the service pack installation
directory prior to running the UPDATE program. To disable the automatic
installation of MDAC, "InstallMdac=NoInstall" should appear before the 
other InstallMdac lines. For example:

InstallMdac=NoInstall
InstallMdac=ForcedInstall
InstallMdac=ContinueInstall

If "InstallMdac=ForcedInstall" is listed first (the default), then MDAC
is automatically installed.

WARNING: No other lines of SNASETUP.INI should be modified

MMC and the SNA Windows NT Client
---------------------------------
Unlike SNA 4.0 SP2, the SNA 4.0 SP2 Windows NT Client Update program 
no longer installs the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) component 
if the client machine is not installed with any features that require 
MMC (such as COMTI or the SNA Server Manager). However, if these 
features are installed on the SNA Windows NT client, then the 
SNA 4.0 SP3 client Update program will automatically install MMC.
Knowledgebase article Q237599 describes this change.

Installing the new OLE/DB Provider and ODBC Driver for DB2
----------------------------------------------------------
SNA Server 4.0 SP2 includes a new OLE DB Provider for DB2 and ODBC 
Driver for DB2 from Microsoft, while previous versions of SNA Server
included a version licensed from StarQuest. SNA 4.0 SP3 includes an 
update to the SNA 4.0 SP2 version. When upgrading from SNA 4.0 or
SNA 4.0 SP1 systems to SNA 4.0 SP3, the server or client computer 
must first be upgraded to SNA 4.0 SP3 by running the Update program 
from a persistent location (i.e., a location where the full extracted 
files exist). Once installed, the new drivers may be installed by 
running the SNA Setup program from the local SNA Server Program 
group and by choosing these new components after selecting Add/Remove 
Components.

Installing the new MSMQ-MQSeries Bridge
---------------------------------------
SNA Server 4.0 SP2 includes the new MSMQ-MQSeries Bridge. The
SNA 4.0 SP3 includes an updated version of the Bridge (40SP3MQ.EXE).
This feature is only supported on Microsoft SNA Server 4.0 SP2 or SP3
systems. For more information about this feature, refer to the 
LICENSE.TXT and README files included in 40SP3MQ.EXE .

Upgrading Host Security to 4.0 SP3
----------------------------------
The Host Security updates for SNA 4.0 SP3 (40SP3IHS.EXE, 40SP3AHS.EXE)
must first be extracted to a directory. To upgrade SNA Server 4.0, 
4.0 SP1 or 4.0 SP2 Host Security to 4.0 SP3, the Setup program must be 
run and the current installation directory and Windows NT user context 
must be entered. No Update program is provided to upgrade the Host
Security components to 4.0 SP3.

Upgrading SNA Windows 3.x and MS-DOS clients to 4.0 SP3
-------------------------------------------------------
The 40SP3CLR.EXE file contains the SNA Server Windows 3.x, a WEB-
installable version of the SNA Windows 9x and Win3x clients, and
MS-DOS and OS/2 client files. The 40SP3CLR.EXE is a Win32 self 
extracting executable. The administrator must first run this file 
and choose a directory to place the extracted files. Windows 3.x 
clients may then connect across the network and run the Setup program 
to install the client files. The setup program can be used to upgrade 
a previous version of the SNA client software.

NOTE: The SNA Windows 3.x and MS-DOS clients are unchanged since
SNA 4.0 SP1, though the WEB-installable client CAB files have been 
updated in SNA 4.0 SP3.

Installing the Updated 4.0 SP3 SDK
----------------------------------
Unlike SNA Server 4.0 SP2, the SNA Server 4.0 SP3 Server, Windows NT 
and Windows 9x client include the SDK files. Also, the Update program 
that is automatically spawned when these self-extracting files are
run (40SP3?S.EXE, 40SP3?C.EXE, 40SP39X.EXE) will update the SDK files
if the SDK option was initially chosen during SNA Server 4.0 
installation.

Installing the Service Pack Files
---------------------------------
Both the SNA Server and SNA client files have been updated in 4.0 SP3.
Updates may be applied in any order -- to the server and/or to the clients.
It is recommended that all systems running SNA Server 4.0 (that is, SNA
Servers and client computers) are updated to 4.0 SP3. It may not be
necessary to update the client computers to SP3 unless you are experiencing
a client problem that has been fixed in SP3.

WARNING: This service pack update is intended to be applied on systems
currently running SNA Server 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2 server or client 
software.  These updates cannot be applied over systems running SNA 
Server 3.x or 2.x releases.

** TO BE APPLIED TO SNA SERVER 4.0 SYSTEMS ONLY!! **

More Information
----------------

As noted above, if /X is not used, the file is self-extracted to the 
directory where the TMP environment variable is pointing. For example, 
if TMP=C:\TEMP , then the C: drive (where this directory exists) must 
have sufficient disk space to accommodate the extracted image. If there 
is insufficient disk space to accommodate the image size, the following 
error will occur:

 Extraction Failed
 Access is denied
     &lt;OK&gt;

If this error occurs, a temporary read-only file may be left in the TMP 
directory tree (for example, in C:\TEMP\ext5232\i386\setup.tdf) which 
may cause the service pack file to continue to fail with "Access is denied". 
To correct this problem, delete the file indicated in the "To Directory:" 
within the progress dialog when the "Access is denied" error is displayed. 
This file may have the "read only" attribute set, so the ATTRIB command may 
be needed to remove this attribute (i.e., ATTRIB -r &lt;file&gt;) in order to 
delete this file.

When UPDATE is run, it displays the following warning:

 WARNING
 You are about to update your current installation of SNA Server with 
 SNA Server 4.0 with Service Pack 3. You will not be able to deinstall 
 this Service Pack and get back to your original setup. Click Yes if 
 you wish to proceed.  
    &lt;Yes&gt;  &lt;No&gt;

Choose Yes to continue (the default is No)

As mentioned above, Update always launches the MDAC setup program, 
which displays the following message box:

   Please wait while MDAC setup completes...

If the following error occurs, then SNA 4.0 SP3 has already been installed:

 Setup Error 689
 Setup cannot update an installation interactively in Quiet mode.

 Setup Error 723
 Setup was unable to read configuration information from the first section 
 of the setup file:     C:\SNA40\setup\server\snafile.stf

If these errors are occurring and you wish to re-apply SNA Server 4.0 SP3,
perform the following steps:

- delete &lt;snaroot&gt;\SETUP\SERVER\SNAFILE.STF 

- modify the following registry value:

 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SNA Server\CurrentVersion\ 
        SNAVersion: REG_SZ: 4.0 Service Pack 3

 change "4.0 Service Pack 3" to "4.0 Service Pack 2" (without the quotes)

- then, re-run the UPDATE program again&lt;BR/&gt;
