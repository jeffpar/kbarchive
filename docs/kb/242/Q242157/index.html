SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to upgrade an Exchange Server computer with the TP4 transport
protocol from Windows NT 4.0 to Windows 2000, the upgrade does not work and you
receive the following error message:

  The currently installed driver for the TP4 protocol is not compatible with
  Microsoft Windows 2000 and will be disabled during the upgrade.

The upgrade, however, does not continue until the protocol is removed.

CAUSE
=====

The TP4 protocol is no longer supported under Windows 2000.

WORKAROUND
==========

Any Exchange Server computers using the TP4 protocol must remain at Windows NT
4.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
