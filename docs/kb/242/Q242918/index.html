SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Uniform Data Transfer calls to IAdviseSink::OnDataChange, a memory
leak of 32 bytes on the client side and 148 bytes on the server side may occur.

The problem occurs only when the client uses the STA model.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next DCOM release that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English-language version of this fix should have the following file
attributes or later:

  Date      Time    Version      Size       File name     Platform

  12/16/99  09:22PM 4.71.1015.0  1,229,056  Dcom98.exe    Windows 98 SE

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There is a memory link in OLE32 when you use Uniform Data Transfer between a
data object on a local server that implements the IDataObject interface and a
client that implements the IAdviseSink interface.

When a client wants to be notified by a data object server that data has been
modified, it calls IDataObject::DAdvise, giving the server a pointer to the
client's IAdviseSink interface. When the data is modified on the server, the
server calls IAdviseSink::OnDataChange to notify the client. The client calls
IDataObject::DUnAdvise to break the connection.

OLE implements data advise holder which implements IDataAdviseHolder (created by
CreateDataAdviseHolder) to help the data object to notify all clients that are
connected to the data object. The server calls
IDataAdviseHolder::SendOnDataChange and the data advise holder then calls
IAdviseSink::OnDataChange on each advise sink that is connected to the server.

The problem is that every call to IAdviseSink::OnDataChange causes a memory leak
of one object of 32 bytes on the client side and 148 bytes on the server side.
The problem only occurs when the client uses the STA model.
