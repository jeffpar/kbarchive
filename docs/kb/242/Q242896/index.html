SYMPTOMS
========

Services for Macintosh (SFM) may cause the computer to stop responding (hang)
when FastIoUnlockSingle (a FastIO dispatch routine) returns FALSE. This corrupts
the kernel memory and is sufficient to cause the computer to hang within a small
number of input/output (I/O) operations. File systems and file system filter
drivers sometimes need to prevent the FastIO path, usually because outstanding
synchronization (for example, OpLocks and ByteRange locks) does not allow a
simple pass-through of the operation to FsRtl or Cache Manager. Because the
majority of FastIO routines are Boolean functions, the FastIO path can be
disabled a FALSE response, thereby forcing an operation to take the Input/Output
Request Packets (IRP) path instead.

Depending on how often a driver must disable FastIoUnlockSingle and the pattern
of unlocks on a given computer, the problem may occur very frequently or very
rarely.

CAUSE
=====

Because SFM attempts to free the IRP twice in the completion routine and once in
the routine that allocated the IRP, it causes Kernel-mode memory corruption.
This in turn causes the computer to hang with a STOP error message.
