The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Component Status Summarizer generates or receives a large number of
replication files, it may become backlogged.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, follow these steps:

1. Copy the Q242498.exe file from the disk on which you received it to a share
  on your network. This is a Microsoft Windows Installer file that updates
  specific files on your site server.

2. Log on to your site server using an account with administrative privileges.

3. On the site server, close the SMS Administrator console.

4. Run the executable file that you copied in step 1 and follow the directions
  in the wizard.

This hotfix is one part of a set of three related hotfixes. You should install
all three for the best performance. For additional information, click the

  Q242496 SMS: Advertisement and Site System Status Summarizers Have
  Performance Problems in Large Hierarchies


This hotfix contains the following changes to the Component Summarizer:

- Removes the six-second delay before processing a replication file.

- Changes the default replication interval for the Component Summarizer from
  five minutes to ten minutes.

- Changes the Component Summarizer so that it explicitly does not replicate
  even after the default ten-minute timer has expired if the only incoming
  status messages have to do with any Summarizer replication actions. Any other
  incoming messages cause replication to occur after the replication timer has
  expired.

  This replication timer is configurable in the Site Control file. To set the
  timer for every 15 minutes, use the following line:

  PROPERTY &lt;Replication Interval&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;900&gt;

NOTE: This is configurable for every summarizer, but the defaults for Offer and
Site System are still five minutes.
