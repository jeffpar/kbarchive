-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Packs 1, 2, 3 
- Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5 for Windows 95 
- Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5 for Windows 98 
- Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5 for Windows NT 4.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to attach a file to a new message in Outlook Web Access (OWA),
you may receive the following error message:

  HTTP/1.0 500 Server Error (A dynamic link library (DLL) initialization
  routine failed.)

The only option available is to close the dialog box, which cancels the message
you are attempting to send.

After this occurs, the following error appears in the application event log on
the Exchange Server computer:

  Event ID: 19
  Source W3SVC
  Type: Error
  Category: None
  Description: The HTTP server was unable to load the ISAPI application
  'c:\exchsrvr\webdata\exupload.dll'. The data is the error.

CAUSE
=====

This error is caused by registry restrictions that prevent guest access; it
occurs when OWA is using Internet Explorer 5. This error occurs if the following
registry key is enabled with a value of 1:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Eventlog\Application\RestrictGuestAccess

This registry key prevents guests or anonymous users from viewing event logs on
the server.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Internet Explorer 5 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

later:
