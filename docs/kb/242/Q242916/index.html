-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Component Object Model (COM) communicates with remote computers through
Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM), it does not release all cached
information from RPC Endpoint Mapper (RPCSS).

If a client (COM) program on one computer connects to to several remote servers
(COM), this behavior results into a large handle count for RPCSS.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by a problem in the RPC run-time component.


RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT 4.0 service pack that contains this fix.
