-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit Specified User (SU) utility
version 2.99 to switch into a specified user context, you may receive the
following error message:

  LogonUser error! (rc22)
  The RPC server is unavailable

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because two versions of the SU utility are available,
version 2.0 and version 2.99. Version 2.99 is included in supplement 3 of the
Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit. The configuration process is different for each
version. If version 2.99 is installed over version 2.0, the user rights listed
below must be removed, or the error message noted earlier is generated. Also, if
version 2.0 is configured incorrectly, you do not have the privileges necessary
to switch into a specified user context.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, in User Manager for Domains, remove the users or groups
from the following user rights, and then run the suss.exe -install command to
install a new service-based component:

  Act as part of the operating system
  Increase Quotas
  Replace a process level token
  Restore files and directories

If you are upgrading over a previous installation of SU, Microsoft recommends
that you revoke the privileges listed above from any users or groups that they
were granted to previously. This can be accomplished in the User Manager
(Usrmgr.exe or Musrmgr.exe):

1. Open User Manager for Domains.

2. On the Policies menu, click User Rights.

3. Click to select the Show Advanced User Rights check box.

4. Remove the users or groups from the list of accounts granted the user right:

  NOTE: Perform the following procedure for the following user rights:

  Act as part of the operating system
  Increase Quotas
  Replace a process level token
  Restore files and directories

  a. In the Right list, select the user right.

  b. In the Grant To list, select the users or groups to remove, and click
     Remove.

5. Click OK to close User Manager for Domains.

NOTE: For Version 2.99, these privileges are no longer required when using SU. In
order to support this, you must install a new service-based component used by
SU. The service component is encapsulated in the Suss.exe executable file, and
this is installed by using the following command at a command prompt:

  suss.exe -install
