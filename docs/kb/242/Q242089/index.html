-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you double-click any setup program, nothing may happen. Also, trying to use
the Add/Remove Programs tool in Control Panel or running the setup program from
a command prompt may have no effect.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur for either of the following reasons:

- Many setup programs are 16-bit. If any .dll files listed in the 'KnownDLLs'
  value at the following registry location are missing or damaged, Microsoft NT
  Virtual DOS Machine (NTVDM), which is required to run 16-bit applications,
  does not run properly:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\WOW

- The Config.nt file or the Autoexec.nt file is missing, damaged, or contains
  unexpected values.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. Verify that all of the files listed in the 'KnownDLLs' value at the following
  registry key are present in either the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder and/or
  the %SystemRoot%\System folder:

 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\WOW

2. To replace any files missing from the above list, copy them from a Windows NT
  4.0-based computer that has a properly working NTVDM to the
  %SystemRoot%\System32 and %SystemRoot%\System folder.

  NOTE: Not all of the .dll files in the list reside both in the System32 folder
  and the System folder, but many do. It does not harm your computer to have
  them duplicated in both locations.

3. If no files are missing, ensure that all the files are undamaged by replacing
  them with the same files from a Windows NT 4.0-based computer that has a
  properly working NTVDM.

4. Restart the computer.
