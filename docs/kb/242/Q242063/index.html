- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The recovery mechanism in JET may incorrectly advance the checkpoint under
certain circumstances. If JET is started and finds that the database is in an
inconsistent state, JET attempts recovery. If the database is locked open for
some reason (by another process such as a backup program), JET receives an error
-1032 (Jet_errFileAccessDenied), but does not handle the error properly. JET
continues to try to play forward the logs into the database and increment the
checkpoint file.

The following events may be observed in the application event log:

Source  Category      Event ID   Description  
==============================================
ESE97	Information	100	The database engine 05.2448.0002 started.

MSExchangeIS	Error	1120	Error Non-database file or corrupted database initializing the Microsoft Exchange Server Information Store database. 
MSExchangeIS	Error	5000	Unable to initialize the Microsoft Exchange Information Store service. Error Non-database file or corrupted database. 

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

The workaround for this issue is to remove the file lock on the database, which
is usually caused by a backup program actively backing up the database. Do not
run file-level backup programs against the Exchange Server database when the
database is running. Stop the Exchange Server services first. The recommended
backup method is to use Exchange Server-aware backup programs to do an online
backup.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.
