SUMMARY
=======

A Windows 2000 Migration DLL displays messages in a user's Upgrade Report by
writing to an [INCOMPATIBLE MESSAGES] section of its Migrate.inf file. However,
these messages can be removed from the Upgrade Report by similar entries in the
[HANDLED] section. This article describes how to force an incompatible message
to display despite the conflict with the [HANDLED] section.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Typically, if you place a file, directory, or registry entry in the [HANDLED]
section, Windows 2000 Setup assumes that you are going to fix any problems
associated with that object. It uses this logic to ignore any entries in the
[INCOMPATIBLE MESSAGES] section that are dependent on the same objects.

In some cases, the object being [HANDLED] also needs a message to be displayed in
the Upgrade Report. For example, if your application did not have an equivalent
Windows 2000 version, the Migration DLL may decide to remove the application
completely. In this case, all directories and registry entries for the
application should be placed in the [HANDLED] section, but you also want to warn
the user that the application will be removed during the upgrade.

The solution involves modifying the condition that triggers the incompatible
message in the [&lt;Message Object Section&gt;] of the Migrate.inf file. The
three documented identifier types are "File," "Registry," and "Directory." A
fourth option is to use the Migration DLL's ProductId as the Message Object and
set it to "ProductId" as the Identifier Type. This will create a message that
will always be displayed. This allows you to "handle" all files and registry
entries associated with your product without suppressing the message in the
Upgrade Report.
