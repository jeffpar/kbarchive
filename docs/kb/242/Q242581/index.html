Last Modified: 27-APR-2000

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 7.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Year 2000 Product Analyzer (Y2K Analyzer) tool identifies
Microsoft Schedule+ version 7.0a as Schedule+ version 7.0. You should check
which version of Schedule+ 7.0 you are running by clicking About Microsoft
Schedule+ on the Help menu.

If you have version 7.0a and you apply the software update for version 7.0, you
will receive the following error message:

  Schedule+ could not load a required dll. Try running Schedule+ setup again.

CAUSE
=====

There are three separate Y2K software updates for Schedule+, one for each of the
three versions, 7.0, 7.0a, and 7.5. Applying the incorrect update causes this
problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

Reinstall Schedule+ from its original source, and verify the correct version by
clicking "About Microsoft Schedule+" on the Help menu. Then apply the correct
software update for that version.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Y2K Analyzer is a tool to help assess the readiness of your computer system
by conducting an inventory of Microsoft software installed on your computer. The
Y2K Analyzer scans your hard drive and creates a report listing the Y2K
readiness status of all Microsoft software found on your computer.

The Y2K Analyzer mistakenly reports Schedule+ version 7.0a as Schedule+ version
7.0. This is significant because there are separate Y2K updates for Schedule+
7.0, 7.0a, and 7.5. If the 7.0 update is incorrectly applied to version 7.0a,
the error condition described above occurs.
