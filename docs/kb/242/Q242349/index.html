-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to make a PPTP connection from a client computer running
Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5 to a server running Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5
that is running Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS), the initial
authentication attempt may not work and you may receive the following error
message:

  Error 5: Access Denied

This problem can also occur if (RRAS) is configured to forward MSCHAP v2
authentication requests to a Non-Microsoft Remote Authentication Dial-In User
Service (RADIUS) server.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because there is a problem with negotiating MS Chap V2 with
NON Microsoft Radius servers. We have enabled a registry setting to negotiate MS
chap V1.

RESOLUTION
==========

correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to

that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
