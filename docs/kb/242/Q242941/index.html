SYMPTOMS
========

If you have an active connection that is using a Plug and Play modem and you
complete an action (such as installing a printer) that re-enumerates the serial
devices, the modem becomes temporarily unavailable and your connection is
dropped. After the re-enumeration is complete, the modem reappears in Device
Manager and works normally.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because all child serial devices are removed and redetected
by Serenum.vxd when re-enumeration is triggered.
