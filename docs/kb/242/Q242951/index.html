-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you delete a computer by using the Systems Management Server (SMS)
Administrator console, some software inventory tables are not properly cleaned
up. This results in "orphaned" records in these tables (these are similar to SMS
1.2 "unused common/specific" records). However, no functionality exists in SMS
2.0 to delete "unused common/specific" records.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack



NOTE: This fix is a SQL script that you can run against the SMS SQL database that
you want to clean. The script is the same, regardless of the platform the SMS
SQL database is running on (Alpha or Intel).

WARNING: Stop the SMS_EXECUTIVE service on the SMS site server before running
this script.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This hotfix creates a delete trigger on the System_DISC table to clean up
inventory data. It also creates a stored procedure (spDelOrphanedSoftwareInv)
that you can schedule to clean up orphaned software inventory from the
SoftwareFile and SoftwareProduct tables.
