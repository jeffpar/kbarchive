-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A malicious user may be able to cause a different program to run in place of
Rasman. Significantly, this program would run in the System context and allow
the program to take almost any action on the computer.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the security descriptor that secures the Rasman.exe
file contains inappropriate Access Control Entries (ACEs) in its Discretionary
Access Control List (DACL). The incorrect ACE could allow an unprivileged user
to change Rasman's operating parameters (including the location of the Rasman
executable file) using Service Control Manager.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has released a tool to reset the permissions to the appropriate
value.

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to systems
determined to be at risk of attack. Please evaluate your system's physical
accessibility, network, and Internet connectivity, and other factors to
determine the degree of risk to your system. If your system is sufficiently at
risk, Microsoft recommends that you apply this fix. Otherwise, wait for the next
Windows NT 4.0 service pack service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information on support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

This hotfix has been posted to the following Internet location as Fixrasi.exe
(x86) and Fixrasa.exe (Alpha):

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/nt40/Hotfixes-PostSP6/Security/Rasman-fix/

NOTE: If you run this file on a computer that cannot connect to the IPC$ share on
the remote computer or if the credentials of the logged on user do not have
administrative privileges on the remote computer, you may receive an error
message stating that RasMan was not fixed.



Terminal Server Edition
-----------------------

To resolve this problem, either obtain the hotfix referenced in this section or
the Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, Security Rollup Package
(SRP). For additional information about the SRP, click the article number below
to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q317636 Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, Security Rollup
  Package

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems that are determined to be at risk of attack. Please evaluate your
computer's physical accessibility, network and Internet connectivity, and other
factors to determine the degree of risk to your computer. Please see the
associated Microsoft Security Bulletin
(http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS99-041.asp) to help make
this determination. This fix may receive additional testing at a later time, to
further ensure product quality. If your computer is sufficiently at risk,
Microsoft recommends that you apply this fix now.

To resolve this problem immediately, download the fix as instructed below or
contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the fix. For a complete
list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and information on
support costs, please go to the following address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

NOTE: The files in the above folder run on Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server
Edition, too.

the remote computer or if the credentials of the logged on user do not have
administrative privileges on the remote computer, you may receive an error
message stating that RasMan was not fixed.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use the Rasman tool to manage dial-up connections. The vulnerability has
nothing to do with Rasman itself; the vulnerability occurs because there is an
opportunity for a malicious user to cause other code to run in place of Rasman.

You can use Service Control Manager (SCM) to create or modify system services.
Security descriptors control access to operating system objects. Services
(including Rasman) are among the objects to which security descriptors apply. A
security descriptor includes a DACL. A DACL is a list of ACEs. Each ACE
specifies the particular rights that one user or group has with respect to the
object. The DACL therefore comprises the entire list of rights that all users
and groups have with respect to the object.

Like other services, Rasman's DACL should only allow administrators to manage
Rasman. However, there is an erroneous ACE in the DACL for Rasman, which allows
any user to manage Rasman using Service Control Manager. A malicious user could
exploit this situation.

A malicious user could request a change in the location and name of the program
for the service. By doing so, a malicious user could substitute any arbitrary
program for the legitimate service, which could be run in a System context. This
vulnerability can be exploited remotely and this issue does not occur
accidentally.

The privileges that a user could gain depend on the specific computer that is
compromised. If a workstation is compromised, the malicious user gains complete
control of the workstation, but cannot directly use this vulnerability to extend
control to other computers. However, if a critical computer (for example, a
domain controller) is attacked, the malicious user could gain control of the
entire network.

There is no vulnerability in Remote Access Service (RAS) functionality. This
problem results because of inappropriate permissions on a registry key; it is
coincidental that the registry key is associated with the RAS service. RAS
itself, including its security features, is not affected by this vulnerability.
