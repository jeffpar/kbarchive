SUMMARY
=======

Setup detects partitions created with the Disk Manager disk partitioning program
developed by Ontrack Computer Systems. Disk Manager creates partitions and
supports a boot partition compatible with MS-DOS. Setup can upgrade partitions
created by the Disk Manager device driver, DMDRVR.BIN.

If you are using DMDRVR.BIN, update it by expanding the new file from the MS-DOS
5.0 installation disks. If the XBIOS.OVL file is on your hard disk, you should
also update it.

NOTE: If you are using MS-DOS 3.x on a system that has a Disk Manager partition
greater than 512 megabytes (MB), contact Ontrack Computer Systems to get an
updated version of Disk Manager and instructions for making the partition
compatible with MS-DOS 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To Update Your Disk Manager Files, follow these steps:

1. Preserve the DMDRVR.BIN file and the XBIOS.OVL file (if your system has it)
  by renaming the file(s) with different extensions, such as .OLD or .BAK.

  For example, if these files are in the root directory, you can rename the
  files by typing the following commands at the MS-DOS command prompt:

  " ren dmdrvr.bin dmdrvr.old
  ren xbios.ovl xbios.old" (without the quotation marks)

2. Copy the EXPAND.EXE file to your hard disk. EXPAND.EXE is on Disk 6
  (5.25-inch disk set) or Disk 3 (3.5-inch disk set). For example, you can type
  the following at the MS-DOS command prompt:

  " copy a:\expand.exe c:\ " (without the quotation marks)

3. Use the following syntax to expand and copy the following file:

  expand [drive1:][path1]dmdrvr.bi_ [drive2:][path2]dmdrvr.bin

  The [drive1:][path1] parameter specifies the location of the compressed file
  you want to expand. The [drive2:][path2] parameter specifies the location of
  the expanded file.

  DMDRVR.BI_ is on Disk 6 (5.25-inch disk set) or Disk 3 (3.5-inch disk set).

  For example, if the DMDRVR.BI_ file is on a disk in drive A, and you want to
  expand the file to the root directory on drive C, type the following at the
  MS-DOS command prompt:

  " expand a:\dmdrvr.bi_ c:\dmdrvr.bin" (without the quotation marks)

  NOTE: Make sure that the device line for the DMDRVR.BIN file in your
  CONFIG.SYS file matches the path of the new DMDRVR.BIN file.

4. If your system has an XBIOS.OVL file, use the following syntax to expand and
  copy the file to your root directory.

  expand [drive1:][path1]xbios.ov_ c:\xbios.ovl

  The [drive1:][path1] parameter specifies the location of the compressed file
  you want to expand.

  This XBIOS.OV_ file is on Disk 6 (5.25-inch disk set) or Disk 3 (3.5-inch disk
  set).

  For example, if the XBIOS.OV_ file is on a disk in drive A, type the following
  at the MS-DOS command prompt:

  " expand a:\xbios.ov_ c:\xbios.ovl" (without the quotation marks)

  WARNING: Do not reboot your system at this point in the procedure.

5. Insert MS-DOS Installation Disk 1 into drive A.

6. Type "a:setup /u" (without the quotation marks) to install MS-DOS 5.0.

Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
