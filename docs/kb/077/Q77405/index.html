The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Within MS-DOS 5.0 or later Shell, if files in the root directory can be viewed
but files in other directories cannot, ensure that the Select Across Directories
option is not active in the Options Menu. If it is inactive, the DOSSHELL.INI
file may be corrupted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DOSSHELL.INI file can be recreated by expanding the appropriate file from
the MS-DOS 5 or later Upgrade disks. The following list identifies the file to
expand based on the monitor being used.

  Monitor          File to Expand
  -------          --------------

  Monochrome:      MONO.IN_
  CGA:             CGA.IN_
  EGA:             EGA.IN_
  EGA monochrome:  MONO.IN_
  VGA:             EGA.IN_
  VGA monochrome:  MONO.IN_

These files are located on disk 2 (3.5-inch format) or disk 3 (5.25-inch format).
It is not necessary to replace other Shell files.

The DOSSHELL.INI file can be corrupted in several ways. The following are two
common causes for a corrupt DOSSHELL.INI file:

- Not exiting Shell properly

  You must exit either by pressing ALT+F4, or by choosing Exit from the File
  menu. In both cases, wait for the DOS prompt to appear before turning the
  computer off. The DOSSHELL.INI is updated each time you exit Shell, so
  cutting power early can damage the file. Note: After pressing SHIFT+F9 to
  temporarily exit to a DOS prompt, type "exit" (without the quotation marks)
  to return to Shell before exiting Shell.

- Editing the file with a word processor that saves the file in binary format

  If a text editor or word processor is used to modify the file, and its default
  file format is its own binary format, verify that the DOSSHELL.INI is saved
  as text only or ASCII format.

For additional information, query on the following words:

  "DOS" (without the quotation marks) and "Shell" (without the quotation marks)
  and "5.0" (without the quotation marks) and "Select Across Directories"
  (without the quotation marks)


Additional query words: 5.00 5.00a 6.00
