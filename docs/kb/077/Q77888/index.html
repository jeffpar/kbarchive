-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When task swapping Bitstream Facelift version 1.0 through MS-DOS Shell, the
screen will blank and the system will hang if the Facelift advanced installation
options are not set correctly.

Use the Bitstream Facelift FLSETUP.EXE program to ensure that the advanced
options are set correctly.

This information applies to Microsoft MS-DOS version 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Bitstream Facelift is a screen/printer font package designed to work with
WordPerfect versions 5.0 and 5.1.

When Facelift is executed through Shell with the Task Swapper active, it will
work properly. When the program is swapped from memory to disk the monitor
blanks and the system hangs.

To adjust the Facelift advanced options, do the following:

1. Use the FLSETUP.EXE program that comes with the Facelift package. It will be
  in the Facelift directory or on Facelift Utility Disk 1.

2. From the disk or directory containing the file FLSETUP.EXE, type the
  following command:

  " flsetup /a" (without the quotation marks)

  This will execute the Advanced Installation Options for Facelift.

3. The following is a list of Options/Settings that will work correctly with
  Shell:

  Field                              Setting
  -----                              -------

  Number of times fonts remade:      0
  Maximum temporary fonts:           32
  Point size for graphics mode:      20
  Use EMS:                           No   (Yes if EMS is used)
  Terminate stay resident:           No
  Hook DOS device drivers:           No

4. Exit FLSETUP.

Bitstream technical support has confirmed the above settings will work with
MS-DOS 5.0 Shell.
