-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you launch or install the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, you may
receive the following error message:

  Application Unknown has unexpectedly quit because of an error type 1.

CAUSE
=====

A "Type 1" error is a Bus Error, which can be caused by several things such as
extension conflicts, corrupt font, memory conflicts, or system corruption.

WORKAROUND
==========

The following is a list of possible workarounds to this problem:

- Load minimal extensions. Go to the Control Panel Extensions Manager. Uncheck
  any unnecessary extensions and restart. You should leave the OLE and
  Networking extensions running, and the Microsoft extensions. If this works,
  you most likely have an extensions conflict. Add the extensions back one by
  one, restarting the computer each time, and test until you find the conflict.
  If you do not have Extensions Manager, holding down the Shift key when you
  reboot will load without extensions.


- If you are running Microsoft Exchange on a PowerMac, try tuning the Memory
  Control Panel. It is recommended to change disk cache size to 1024K, turn on
  Modern Memory Manager, turn on Virtual Memory, and set the Virtual Memory to
  two times "built-in memory" plus 1MB.

  Example: If the PowerMac has 16MB of RAM, then set the Virtual Memory to 33MB.

- Change the "Minimum size" to run the application to 4500K. Highlight the
  Microsoft Exchange application file, and choose "Get Info" by holding down
  the Apple and I keys. Change the "Minimum size" to 4500K. You can also try
  maximizing the size to 4500K.

  NOTE: For PowerMacs, if Virtual Memory is turned off, memory requirements will
  increase. This will vary by PowerMac model and System version. For more
  information, choose "Get Info" on the Microsoft Exchange application.

- Drag the Fonts folder, located in the System folder, to the desktop. Restart
  the Macintosh to create a new Fonts folder. Things will not look very nice,
  but this step is for troubleshooting only. If everything works fine, reload
  the fonts from the system disk or CD, and/or from other manufacturer's
  installation files.

- Reinstall Microsoft Exchange. To perform a "clean" Microsoft Exchange
  installation, see Q158519, "XCLN: Removing and Reinstalling the Macintosh
  Client" in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

- Rebuild the desktop. Restart and hold down the Option and Apple keys. Hold
  down until prompted to rebuild the desktop, and then click OK.

- Zap the Parameter RAM (PRAM). Restart and hold down the Option+Apple+P+R
  keys. Hold down all four keys and the system will act like it is rebooting.
  Repeat this three times to make sure the PRAM has been cleared, and then let
  the machine boot normally.

- There may be System corruption. Try a new installation of the System
  software. Then install Microsoft Exchange (and only Microsoft Exchange) and
  test it. To install a new System folder alongside the current System folder,
  boot to the install disk or CD, and then hold down the Command+Shift+K keys
  when you run the installation.
