- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You have enabled Domain Name System (DNS) and configured a specific DNS server
address given to you by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) for your Windows 95
or Windows NT remote client. You are still connected to your local LAN and WINS
is enabled. Name resolution works fine while you are connected directly to your
local LAN, but when you disconnect your network adapter and dial in remotely to
the local LAN, name resolution slows significantly. This slow down may cause
some server-based applications, such as Lotus Notes, to time out.

CAUSE
=====

Because you are now dialing into your local LAN and not to your ISP, the
configured DNS server address is now invalid. Your remote client tries to
resolve names against a non-existent DNS server and this introduces delays in
the name resolution process.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, remove the invalid static entry for the DNS server.
You must remove the entry from both Windows NT and the DUN connectoid.

To remove the invalid DNS server IP address from Windows NT, perform the
following steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then
  double-click Network.

2. Click the Protocols tab, select TCP/IP protocol, and then click Properties.

3. Click the DNS tab, and then delete the IP address.

-and-

To remove the invalid DNS server IP address from the DUN connectoid, perform the
following steps:

1. From the Desktop, double-click My Computer, and then double-click Dial-Up
  Networking.

2. Click the More tab for the required phonebook entry, and click: "Edit entry
  and modem properties..."

3. Click the Server tab, then click TCP/IP Settings...

4. Ensure that the invalid IP address does not exist in the "Specify name server
  addresses" dialog box for either Primary or Secondary DNS.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51 and 4.0.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With both DNS and WINS installed on the client, Microsoft name resolution
specifies that the WINS server should be contacted first. In this case, it does
not happen as intended.
