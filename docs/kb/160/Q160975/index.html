SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to import a Kodak Photo-CD (.pcd) file into Photo Editor, and use the
Options button in the Open dialog box to change the size and/or color depth of
the image, you may receive one of the following error messages:

  Could not read file

  -or-

  This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down. If the
  problem persists, contact the program vendor.

If you click the Details button, you see the following additional information:

  PHOTOED caused an Invalid Page Fault in module PHOTOED.EXE at
  &lt;address&gt;.

If you don't receive an error message, the imported image may be cropped, or you
may see multiple copies of the image.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if you click the Preview button in the Open dialog box
before you click the Options button to change the resolution.

If you don't click the Preview button, the image imports correctly.


RESOLUTION
==========

If you want to control the resolution and color depth a .pcd of a file when you
import it into Photo Editor, do not use the Preview button to see what the image
looks like. Use the Options button instead. When you click the Options button,
the Photo CD dialog box appears. This dialog box provides a thumbnail image of
the .pcd file.

If you really want to use the Preview button, you can do the following:

1. In Photo Editor, click Open on the File menu.

2. Open the folder that contains the .pcd file you wish to import.

3. Click the Preview button to see what the .pcd file looks like.

4. Click the Close button to close the Preview dialog box.

5. Click the name of a different .pcd file.

6. Click the name of the .pcd file you actually want to import.

7. Click the Options button.

8. In the Photo CD dialog box, choose the resolution, color depth, and
  orientation that you want to use. Click the OK button.

9. Click Open.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Each .pcd file contains the same picture in several different sizes. For
example, a single .pcd file may contain the same picture in the following
dimensions:

  192 x  128 pixels
  384 x  256 pixels
  768 x  512 pixels
 1536 x 1024 pixels

When you open a .pcd file in Photo Editor, you can choose which of these picture
sizes to extract. You can also choose whether the picture imports in 24-bit
colors, or in 8-bit (256) colors. You can additionally choose to import the
picture right-side up, upside down, rotated left, or rotated right.
