SUMMARY
=======

The BackOffice Resource Kit Part One (BORK 1), which includes the Microsoft
Exchange Server 4.0 Resource Kit and the Systems Management Server Resource Kit,
is now available. This article describes the new Microsoft Exchange tools
available in BORK 1 and the bug fixes made to the tools previously released on
the Microsoft Exchange Server Resource Kit compact disc.

MORE INFORMATION
================

BORK 1 supersedes the Microsoft Exchange Server Resource Kit compact disc. BORK
1 contains all the original tools released on the Resource Kit compact disc as
well as the following six new Microsoft Exchange tools.

- AT&amp;T Mail Migration Wizard
  Migrates AT&amp;T Mail Access PLUS and AT&amp;T PMX mail messages into
  personal folders or a mailbox.

- AutoFill
  Assists in resolving display names as you type in the Microsoft Exchange
  client.

- Profile Generator
  Simplifies the process of creating Microsoft Exchange client profiles for
  roving users. When you create profiles for each type of operating system,
  users can use any computer with any operating system and still have access to
  their mailbox.

- Schedule+ Address Book Assistant
  Copies address book entries and enters them into a Microsoft Schedule+ contact
  list.

- Self-Certification Form
  For Temporary Export of encryption software; this tool is to be used when
  taking products that contain encryption, such as Microsoft Exchange Server,
  out of the country.

- Simple Mail Handler
  Archives and filters incoming messages in the Microsoft Exchange client. This
  tool is client-based, so connection to a Microsoft Exchange Server is not
  necessary.
