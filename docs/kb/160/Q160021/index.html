-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the GoBack Method in a Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications
macro, or when you press SHIFT+F5, Word may switch to another open document.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Visual Basic for Applications GoBack Method and
the SHIFT+F5 keystroke operate at the Word session level rather than at the Word
document level. The Visual Basic for Applications GoBack Method switches among
the last three locations in the currently open documents in which text or
formatting has changed.

If only one document is open, the GoBack Method switches among the last three
editing positions in the current document.

When you run a macro that uses the GoBack Method and you have more than one
document open in Word, the insertion point may go to an unexpected location. For
example, if you use the GoBack Method in an AutoOpen macro, the insertion point
may go to another document instead of going to the last editing position within
the document you are opening.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem and return to the previous editing location within a
document, use one of the following methods.

Method 1: Set a Permanent Bookmark
----------------------------------

When you run the macro, the insertion point will go to this bookmark location.

The following macro creates a bookmark called "mark" at the insertion point.

NOTE: If the document that contains the bookmark is not open, you will receive an
error.

     Sub SetBookMark()
        On Error Resume Next
        Selection.Bookmarks.Add Name:="YourBookmarkName"
        If Err &gt; 0 Then MsgBox Err.Description
     End Sub

The following macro returns the insertion point to the bookmark you set.

     Sub GoToMark()
        On Error Resume Next
        Selection.GoTo What:=wdGoToBookmark, Name:="mark"
        If Err &gt; 0 Then MsgBox Err.Description
     End Sub

For more information about adding bookmarks, click the Office Assistant while in
the Visual Basic Editor, type "Add Bookmark" (without the quotation marks),
click Search, and then click to view "Add Method(Bookmarks Collection)."

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If the Assistant is not able to answer your query, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q176476 OFF: Office Assistant Not Answering Visual Basic Questions

Method 2: Set a Named Range
---------------------------

The named range exists only while the macro is running. You can return to the
named location from within any document while the document that contains the
named range is open.

NOTE: If the document that contains the named range is not open, you will receive
an error message.

The following macro defines a range called "MyRange" at the insertion point:

   Sub SetRangeMark()
        On Error Resume Next
        Set MyRange = Selection.Range
        If Err &gt; 0 Then MsgBox Err.Description
     End Sub

The following macro returns the insertion point to the range set in the previous
example:

   Sub GoToMark()
        On Error Resume Next
        Selection.GoTo What:=wdGoToBookmark, Name:="mark"
        If Err &gt; 0 Then MsgBox Err.Description
     End Sub

For more information about Range Method, click the Office Assistant while in the
Visual Basic Editor, type "Range Method" (without the quotation marks), click
Search, and then click to view "Range Method."

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If the Assistant is not able to answer your query, please see
