SYMPTOMS
========

If a player receives a red card and is not ejected from the game, the game may
become unstable.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, shut down and restart Soccer or substitute the player
as soon as possible.

To substitute a player, do the following:

1. During the game, press the ESC key and then click the Coaching button.

2. To change a player's position on the home team, drag a new player's number
  over the number of the red carded player.

3. To change a player's position on the away team, click See Away and then drag
  a new player's number over the number of the red carded player.

4. Click Play Game.

NOTE: The substitution will be made when the ball is next out of play (goal
kicks, corner kicks, and throw-ins) and in your possession.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Players who receive a red card should be ejected from the game and be unable to
continue playing.
