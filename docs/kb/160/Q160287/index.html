SUMMARY
=======

This article shows you how to embed a bitmap image in a Microsoft Exchange Forms
Designer Form RichEdit field by extending the form with Microsoft Visual Basic
4.0 16-bit version.

NOTE: Only the bitmap image (BMP) format is supported in the Exchange Forms
Designer RichEdit field.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To embed a bitmap image in a Microsoft Exchange Forms Designer Form RichEdit
field:

1. First, the designer must create an Exchange Form using the Exchange Forms
  Designer.

2. The form must contain one RichEdit field whose reference name is:

     MAPI_BODY_CUSTOM

3. Install the form to the appropriate folder or registry.

4. Exit the Exchange Forms Designer and load the Formname.vbp file into Visual
  Basic 4.0 16-bit version.

5. In Visual Basic, create a command button on the form panel.

6. In Visual Basic, select the picture control (named Picture1 by default) and
  place that onto the form paneling.

7. In Visual Basic, place the following code behind the command button created
  in step 5. In the first line of code, the LoadPicture method points to the
  path and file to find the bitmap image you want to load. In this example,
  "c:\exchange\current.bmp" is used.

        Picture1.Picture = LoadPicture("c:\exchange\current.bmp")
        Clipboard.Clear
        Clipboard.SetData Picture1.Picture, vbCFBitmap
        MAPI_Body_Custom_Ctrl.Action = 12  'RE_ACTION_PASTE

  NOTE: For the recipient to successfully display the form bitmap image, the
  file will need to be available at the path specified in the LoadPicture
  method. This can be done by modifying the .CFG file, for the form project in
  the File#= entry. This entry is used to copy files locally, along with the
  form executable.

8. Using the Exchange Client Forms Manager, install the form into the
  appropriate folder or library.
