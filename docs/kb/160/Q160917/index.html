-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the PAGE UP or the PAGE DOWN keys in a Formset that contains a
Toolbar, Visual FoxPro 5.0 crashes.

WORKAROUND
==========

Put the following code in the KeyPress Method of the form. However, the best
location would be in the KeyPress Method of the form super class:

   DO CASE
   CASE nKeyCode = 3 &amp;&amp;PageDown
     NODEFAULT &amp;&amp; Don't let VFP do it's own thing for this KeyStroke.
     &amp;&amp; Loop through the forms in the Formset.
     FOR i = 1 TO THISFORMSET.FORMCOUNT
     &amp;&amp; Find the active form in the forms collection.
        IF THISFORMSET.FORMS(i).NAME = THISFORMSET.ACTIVEFORM.NAME
        &amp;&amp; See if the next number(i) in the Formset is a valid number
        &amp;&amp; regarding FormCount.
           IF BETWEEN(i+1,1,THISFORMSET.FORMCOUNT)
           &amp;&amp; If it is, see if the next form is a Form and not a Toolbar.
              IF UPPER(THISFORMSET.FORMS(i+1).baseclass) = 'FORM'
              &amp;&amp; If it is, show the Form and get out.
                 thisformset.FORMS(i+1).SHOW()
                 EXIT
              ENDIF
           ELSE
           &amp;&amp; If the next number(i) was not a valid number regarding
           &amp;&amp; FormCount, start the loop again from the top. This keeps
           &amp;&amp; the "expected flow" or expected navigation of the forms.
              FOR li = 1 TO THISFORMSET.FORMCOUNT
              &amp;&amp; See if the next form in the Formset is a Form and not a
              &amp;&amp; Toolbar.
                 IF UPPER(THISFORMSET.FORMS(li).baseclass) = 'FORM'
                 &amp;&amp; If it is, Show the Form and get out.
                    thisformset.FORMS(li).SHOW()
                    EXIT
                 ENDIF
              ENDFOR
           ENDIF
        ENDIF
     ENDFOR
   CASE nKeyCode = 18 &amp;&amp; PageUp
     NODEFAULT &amp;&amp; Don't let VFP do it's own thing for this KeyStroke.
     &amp;&amp; Loop through the forms in the Formset.
     FOR i = 1 TO THISFORMSET.FORMCOUNT
     &amp;&amp; Find the active form in the forms collection.
        IF THISFORMSET.FORMS(i).NAME = THISFORMSET.ACTIVEFORM.NAME
        &amp;&amp; See if the previous number(i) in the Formset is a valid number
        &amp;&amp; regarding FormCount.
           IF BETWEEN(i-1,1,THISFORMSET.FORMCOUNT)
           &amp;&amp; If it is, see if the next form is a Form and not a Toolbar.
              IF UPPER(THISFORMSET.FORMS(i-1).baseclass) = 'FORM'
              &amp;&amp; If it is, Show the Form and get out.
                 thisformset.FORMS(i-1).SHOW()
                 EXIT
              ELSE
              &amp;&amp; If the previous number(i) was not a valid number regarding
              &amp;&amp; FormCount, start the loop again from the bottom. This keeps
              &amp;&amp; the "expected flow" or expected navigation of the forms.
                 FOR li = THISFORMSET.FORMCOUNT TO 1 STEP -1
                 &amp;&amp; See if the next form in the Formset is a Form and not a
                 &amp;&amp; Toolbar.
                    IF UPPER(THISFORMSET.FORMS(li).baseclass) = 'FORM'
                    &amp;&amp; If it is, Show the Form and get out.
                       thisformset.FORMS(li).SHOW()
                       EXIT
                    ENDIF
                 ENDFOR
                 EXIT
              ENDIF
           ENDIF
        ENDIF
     ENDFOR
   ENDCASE
