-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
- Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using an Intel motherboard with an AMI/Intel BIOS or an Iomega IDE
Zip drive installed on the secondary IDE channel, you may receive a "Fatal
Exception Error" error message when you start the computer without a disk in the
Zip drive or you eject the disk from the Zip drive.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the following conditions exist:

- The computer has an IDE removable drive that uses Media Status Notification
  (the Iomega IDE Zip drive is one such drive).

- The computer's BIOS unmasks the PIC for the IRQ on the controller on which
  the drive is located.

- The drive is accessed with no disk in the drive.

- The BIOS touches the Alt Status register when an interrupt is vectored to it.

When these conditions exist, an interrupt may be reflected to the BIOS, which can
cause a fault.
