SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install alternate operating system printer drivers, such as
Windows NT 3.51 printer drivers on a Windows NT 4.0 Server computer, you may get
the following error message:

  Alternate drivers cannot be installed an unexpected error occurred.

The error message may also occur when you attempt to install a third-party
Windows NT 3.51 PostScript driver for a Windows NT 4.0 printer control language
(PCL) printer (or vise versa) using the Have Disk option.

CAUSE
=====

This error is usually caused when using an OEM printer driver disk whose printer
description field, found in the Windows NT 3.5x Printer.inf file, does not match
that of the Windows NT 4.0 %SystemRoot%\Inf\Ntprint.inf file. This problem can
also occur when you try to add an alternate driver in Windows NT 4.0 for a
printer that was not natively supported in Windows NT 3.5x while using the
Windows NT 3.5x compact disc as the installation source path.

For example, Windows NT 4.0 Ntprint.inf has the following entry for the HP Color
LaserJet 5:

  [HP]
  "HP Color LaserJet 5" = Pcl5ems.dll.bidi

The Hewlett-Packard OEM Windows NT 3.51 driver disk contains a Printer.inf file
whose entry does not match the description in the Windows NT 4.0 Ntprint.inf
file:

  [Options]
  "HP Color LaserJet 5/5M (HP)" = hpc2ui, hpc2lpd, hpc2drv


RESOLUTION
==========

If you are installing a third-party printer driver as an alternate driver, make
sure that the non-native driver is the same type (PCL or PostScript) as the
Windows NT printer.

-or-

If the printer descriptions in the Printer.inf and Ntprint.inf files do not
match, use the following steps to resolve this problem:

1. Copy the vendor-supplied installation files to a folder on your hard disk
  drive, including the printer information file (Printer.inf). If desired, make
  a backup copy of the Printer.inf file.

2. In Notepad, open the Windows NT 4.0 Ntprint.inf file located in the
  %SystemRoot%\Inf folder.

3. Search for the description field for the printer in question and make a note
  of it for step six.

4. In Notepad, open the Printer.inf file from the vendor-supplied files on the
  hard disk drive.

5. Search for the description of the same printer in question.

6. Change the description in the Printer.inf file to match the description in
  the Ntprint.inf file as noted in step two.

7. Close and save the changes in the Printer.inf file.

8. Close the Ntprint.inf file (with no changes made).

9. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.
  Right-click the printer in question and click Properties, and then click the
  Sharing tab.

10. Select the alternate driver to install (that is, Windows NT 3.5 or 3.51
  x86).

11. When prompted with the message similar to the following:

  Please insert the floppy disk labeled Windows NT 3.5 or
  3.51 x86 into drive A:

  Click OK and browse to the vendor-supplied folder on the hard disk drive and
  select the modified Printer.inf file.


NOTE: You can also modify the Ntprint.inf file to match the description in the
vendor supplied Print.inf or Printer.inf file.

The remainder of the installation should no longer return errors, and the
alternate driver should be installed successfully.
