-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When trying to load certain Systems Management Server components or their help
files, the application or help file fails to load because the application cannot
find the required file.

Any of the following may occur:

- When you select the Help option from the Systems Management Server Event Trap
  Translator utility, the following error message appears:

  Cannot find file: 00000xxx\EVENTRAP.HLP"

  Where xxx is your current non-U.S. locale.


- When you select the Help option from the Systems Management Server Service
  Manager, the following error message appears:

  Can't open help file: 00000xxx\SMS.HLP"

  Where xxx is your current non-U.S. locale.


- When you try to run the Systems Management Server MIF Form Generator (MIFGEN)
  you receive an error message stating that Mifgen.exe cannot locate its
  resource DLL file, _Mifgen.dll.


CAUSE
=====

When the Systems Management Server Administration tools are installed on a
computer running Windows NT that is not configured for U.S. English, the
components outlined above attempt to load files from the incorrect language
resource directory.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you can create a locale directory parallel to the
existing 00000409 (US English locale) directory, where the resource DLLs and
Help files are located. Copying all existing files from the existing 00000409
directory to the new directory will correct all problems noted above.

All files in the Site.srv\Platform.bin\00000409 directory (where platform is the
platform you are using, such as x86, ALPHA, or MIPS) can be copied to a
newly-created locale directory that may be created parallel to the 00000409 U.S.
English locale directory.

For example, the UK English locale is 00000809. By creating the directory
Site.Srv\Platform.bin\00000809, and then copying all the files from the U.S.
locale directory to the newly-created directory, the Systems Management Server
resources and Help files can be loaded successfully.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft
Systems Management Server version 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on
obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
