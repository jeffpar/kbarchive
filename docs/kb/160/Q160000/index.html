-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

MS-DOS clients that run the DOS extender Dos4gw.exe before Systems Management
Server hardware inventory is collected may result in unlikely extended memory
values in client inventory. For example, an MS-DOS client with 32 MB of memory
that runs Dos4gw.exe in the Autoexec.bat (before hardware inventory is
collected) may report 64 MB of extended memory in client inventory.

CAUSE
=====

Memory inventory is incorrect because Dos4gw.exe is not closing high memory area
(HMA) handles it uses to access XMS memory. Dos4gw.exe opens HMA handles to
access XMS memory managed by the resident A20 handler (such as Himem.sys).

Systems Management Server memory inventory is collected by summing the total
amount of memory in use by the available HMA memory handles. In this case,
Dos4gw.exe is not closing some HMA handles when it quits, leaving two handles
still allocated. In the 32 MB client example Dos4gw.exe opens a handle for 516K,
and another for 30,440K. When Dos4gw.exe exits, it does not close its HMA
handles; when Systems Management Server inventory sums them with the default
handles in use (totaling 31,680K), the extended memory value is reported
incorrectly as 62,636K.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, run Dos4gw.exe after the Systems Management Server
hardware inventory has been collected.
