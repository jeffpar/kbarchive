SUMMARY
=======

A new interface was added as a performance enhancement for SQL Server when
running under Windows NT. This enhancement involves scatter/gather I/O
functionality.


MORE INFORMATION
================

What is Scatter/Gather?
-----------------------

Scatter/gather is a standard technique used in some high-performance I/O
situations. It typically refers to Direct Memory Access (DMA) transfers. A given
block of data might exist in memory as several discrete buffers. Without
scatter/gather, when setting up a memory-to-disk transfer, the operating system
will often do a transfer for each buffer, or block move them to a single larger
buffer before initiating the transfer. Both of these are inefficient. It is
better if the operating system/driver/hardware gathers up the data from the
discrete locations in memory and transfers them "in place" as a single
operation. Likewise, on input from disk, if the data block is scattered directly
to the necessary locations in memory without intermediate block moves, and so
on, it is faster.

Interface Specification
-----------------------

ReadFileScatter

The ReadFileScatter function reads data from a file, starting at the position
indicated by the file offset in the OVERLAPPED structure, and distributes the
data into multiple user buffers.

  BOOL ReadFileScatter(
  &lt;BLOCKQUOTE&gt;
      HANDLE hFile,                         // handle of file to read
      FILE_SEGMENT_ELEMENT aSegmentArray[], // array of buffer segments that
  receives data
      DWORD nNumberOfBytesToRead,           // number of bytes to read
      LPDWORD lpReserved,                   // reserved must be NULL
      LPOVERLAPPED lpOverlapped             // address of structure for data
     );

Parameters

hFile

Identifies the file to be read. The file handle must have been created with
GENERIC_READ access to the file.

The file must be opened using FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED to specify asynchronous I/O,
and FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING to specify non-cached I/O.

aSegmentArray

Points an array of pointers to segments. A segment is a memory buffer where part
of the transferred data should be placed. Segments are system page sized and
must be aligned on a page size boundary.

The memory segment can be allocated using VirtualAllocVlm, or can be normal
32-Bit address memory but not both.

NNumberOfBytesToRead

Specifies the number of bytes to be read from the file.

lpReserved

Reserved must be NULL.

lpOverlapped

Points to an OVERLAPPED structure. This structure is required and must point to a
valid OVERLAPPED structure.

The read operation starts at the offset specified in the OVERLAPPED structure and
ReadFileScatter may return before the read operation has been completed. In this
case, ReadFileScatter returns FALSE and the GetLastError function returns
ERROR_IO_PENDING. This allows the calling process to continue while the read
operation finishes. The application can use either
GetOverlappedResult/HasOverlappedIoCompleted to pick up I/O completion
notification, or GetQueuedCompletionStatus to pick up I/O completion.

Return Values

If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero. If the function fails, the
return value is zero. To get extended error information, call GetLastError. If
ReadFileScatter attempts to read past the end of the file, the function returns
zero, and GetLastError returns ERROR_HANDLE_EOF

Remarks

Each FILE_SEGMENT_ELEMENT is 64 bits long. All 64 bits are used to calculate the
buffer pointer; therefore, applications must explicitly zero the upper 32 bits
of the element on systems which do not support 64-bit pointers.

WriteFileGather

The WriteFileGather function gathers data from multiple buffers and writes the
data to a file. The function is designed for asynchronous operation. The
function starts writing data to the file at the position specified by the
OVERLAPPED structure.

  BOOL WriteFileGather(
      HANDLE hFile,                // handle to file to write to
      FILE_SEGMENT_ELEMENT aSegmentArray [], // array of buffer segments
  containing the data
      DWORD nNumberOfBytesToWrite,    // number of bytes to write
      LPDWORD lpReserved,             // Reserved must be NULL
      LPOVERLAPPED lpOverlapped       // pointer to structure needed for
  overlapped I/O
     );

Parameters

hFile

Identifies the file to be written to. The file handle must have been created with
GENERIC_WRITE access to the file. The file must be opened using
FILE_FLAG_OVERLAPPED to specify asynchronous I/O, and FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING to
specify non-cached I/O.

aSegmentArray

Points an array of pointers to segments. A segment is a memory buffer where part
of the transferred data should be placed. Segments are system page sized and
must be aligned on a page size boundary. The memory segment can be allocated
using VirtualAllocVlm, or can be normal 32-bit address memory, but not both.

NNumberOfBytesToWrite

Specifies the number of bytes to write to the file.

Unlike the MS-DOS operating system, Windows NT interprets a value of zero as
specifying a null write operation. A null write operation does not write any
bytes but does cause the time stamp to change.

lpReserved

Reserved must be NULL.

LpOverlapped

Points to an OVERLAPPED structure. This structure is required and must point to a
valid OVERLAPPED structure. The write operation starts at the offset specified
in the OVERLAPPED structure and WriteFileGather may return before the write
operation has been completed. In this case, WriteFileGather returns FALSE and
the GetLastError function returns ERROR_IO_PENDING. This allows the calling
process to continue processing while the write operation is being completed. The
application can use either GetOverlappedResult/HasOverlappedIoCompleted to pick
up I/O completion notification, or GetQueuedCompletionStatus to pick up I/O
completion.

Return Values

If the function succeeds, the return value is nonzero. If the function fails, the
return value is zero. To get extended error information, call GetLastError.

Remarks

Each FILE_SEGMENT_ELEMENT is 64 bits long. All 64 bits are used to calculate the
buffer pointer; therefore, applications must explicitly zero the upper 32 bits
of the element on systems which do not support 64-bit pointers.

If part of the file is locked by another process and the write operation overlaps
the locked portion, this function fails.

Unlike the MS-DOS operating system, Windows NT interprets zero bytes to write as
specifying a null write operation and WriteFileGather does not truncate or
extend the file. To truncate or extend a file, use the SetEndOfFile function.

STATUS
======

Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2 introduced a new interface that acts as a
performance enhancer for SQL Server when running under Windows NT. This
enhancement involves scatter/gather and input/output functionality.
