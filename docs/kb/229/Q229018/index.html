-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When multiple programs belonging to the same package are advertised to a client,
the Available Programs Manager (APM) scheduler might fail to keep track of some
programs that have been executed, causing the scheduler to re-execute some of
those programs.

The scheduler executes the jobs stored in Ms\Sms\Clicomp\Apa\Data\Jobs and keeps
track of executed jobs in the Ms\Sms\Clicomp\Apa\Data\Complete directory. The
jobs are stored as with a file name composed of the package ID and a numerical
extension (index), such as:

  F1200007.000
  F1200007.001
  F1200007.002

To work around this problem, advertise only one program per package.

CAUSE
=====

A problem with the management of the jobs indexes is the cause of this issue.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server 2.0. For additional information, click the following article number to
view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Systems Management Server 2.0.
This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack
Service Pack 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can determine the version of APM that your clients are using by doing either
of the following:

- On your site server, open the Compver.ini file in the
  SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Smsapm32 directory. If this file is version
  2.00.1239.0020 or later, you do not need the fix.

- On the Systems Management Server client, double-click the Systems Management
  icon in Control Panel and then click the Components tab. If the version
  number of the Available Programs Manager is 2.00.1239.0020 or later, you do
  not need the fix.
