- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

After applying Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 2 (SP2), users who receive
forwarded posts from public folders will not be able to do a Reply-all. The
message remains a post during the forward process, and the only valid operations
are Reply, Forward, and Post-reply.

CAUSE
=====

Changes were made in Exchange Server 5.5 SP2 to preserve the message class for
forwarded messages when the "Leave message intact" method is used with a Folder
Assistant rule. For additional information, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q184333 XADM: Message Class Changed during Forward from Public Folder

Previously, a post (IPM.Post message class) was changed to a note (IPM.Note
message class) during the forward operation. Changing the message class can
prevent forms from working on forwarded messages. Exchange Server 5.5 SP2
corrected this problem by preserving the message class during the forward.

Some customers were relying on this transformation of the message class from
IPM.Post to IPM.Note to allow MAPI clients to Reply-all to these forwarded
posts. For these customers, the changes made in Exchange Server 5.5 SP2 prevent
the client from working as they anticipated.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Store

+--------------------------+
| File name   | Version    | 
+--------------------------+
| Store.exe   | 5.5.2607.0 | 
+--------------------------+
| Mdbmsg.dll  | 5.5.2607.0 | 
+--------------------------+
| Gapi32.dll  | 5.5.2607.0 | 
+--------------------------+
| Netif.dll   | 5.5.2607.0 | 
+--------------------------+
| Dsamain.exe | 5.5.2600.0 | 
+--------------------------+


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server version 5.5
Service Pack 2. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The default behavior of this new information store is to preserve the message
class for forwarded messages. If you wish to revert the server to performing the
transformation of the message class, then you must install this fix, and specify
a new registry value.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Go to the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersPublic

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and use the following entry:

  Value Name: Enable Old Forward Method
  Data Type: REG_DWORD
  Value: 1

4. Exit the Registry Editor, and restart the information store service for the
  change to take effect.

Setting the registry value to 0 (or removing it) restores Exchange Server 5.5 to
preserving the message class during the forward operation.
