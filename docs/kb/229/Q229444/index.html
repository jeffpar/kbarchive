-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Word 97 to open a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) file
that was created in Microsoft Word 2000, Word 97 opens the file as text only or
displays a dialog box prompting you to open the file as text only.

CAUSE
=====

If the "Confirm conversion at Open" check box is not selected (click Options on
the Tools menu, and then click the General tab), Word 97 opens the file as text
only. If this option is selected, Word 97 displays the Convert File dialog box,
prompting you to select the file format.

The converter that Word 97 uses to open HTML files interprets the file as text
only. Because the converter was developed before Word 2000 shipped, the
converter does not recognize some of the information in the HTML file that Word
2000 creates. The converter does not interpret the file as an HTML file and
opens the file as text only by default.

RESOLUTION
==========

To open the file as HTML, select the "Confirm conversion at Open" check box.
Then you are prompted to select the file format. To do this, follow these
steps:

1. Start Word 97. Make sure you have at least one document open.

2. On the Tools menu, click Options.

3. Click the General tab.

4. Click to select the "Confirm conversion at Open" check box. Click OK.

When you attempt to open the HTML file, the Convert File dialog box appears. In
the list of file formats, select HTML Document and click OK.
