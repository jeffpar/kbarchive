-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On occasion, when an advertised program asks Systems Management Server to
restart the computer the countdown before the machine reboots does not appear.
Instead, the system reboots as soon as the advertisement is completed. When
possible, do not configure the package to restart the computer. See further
instructions in the More Information section below.

CAUSE
=====

This can occur due to a communications problem (IPC) between the Available
Programs Manager (SMSAPM32.EXE) and the Advertised Programs Monitor
(SMSMON32.EXE).

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server 2.0. For additional information, click the following article number to
view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Systems Management Server 2.0.
This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack
Service Pack 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The reboot request is configured in the General tab of the Program Properties
when the After Running option is set to Systems Management Server Restarts
Computer.

You can determine the version of APM that your clients are using by doing either
of the following:

- On your site server, open the Compver.ini file in the
  SMS\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Smsapm32 directory. If this file lists a version
  2.00.1239.0030 or later, you do not need the fix.

- On the Systems Management Server client, double-click the Systems Management
  Server icon in Control Panel and then click the Components tab. If the
  version number of the Available Programs Manager is 2.00.1239.0030 or later
  you do not need the fix.
