SUMMARY
=======

Mfceqado.exe is an English Query ADO Visual C++ sample that uses ADO in a Visual
C++ MFC application to query SQL Server statements generated by the English
Query engine. The sample uses DataGrid Control version 6.0 (OLEDB) to display
the results.

Description of Important Files:

Dbinter.cpp: English Query module to execute and display SQL languge.

HistoryDlg.cpp: English Query file that implements History and Suggested
Questions dialog box.

ListClarifyDlg.cpp: English Query file that implements List Clarification dialog
box.

Mfcequi.cpp: A front-end UI for English query.

MfcequiDlg.cpp: Main dialog box for a front-end UI for English Query.

Nlinter.cpp: Interface to English Query Engine Object Model.

ListClarifyDlg.cpp: Implements Query Window dialog box.

ShowSQLDlg.cpp: Implements Show SQL dialog box.

The English Query code used in this sample is very similar to the MFCUI C++
Remote Data Objects (RDO) English Query sample that ships with the SQL Server
7.0 CD-ROM.

Refer to the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article for more information on
how to use DataGrid Control with ADO in Visual C++:

  Q229029 SAMPLE: AdoDataGrid.exe Demonstrates Using ADO with DataGrid

Steps to Run Sample:

1. Build and run Mfcequi.exe.

2. Specify an English Query (EQ) application (.eqc) file and a question (.eqq)
  file in the Welcome dialog box. You can use either the Pubs.eqc or
  NorthWind.eqc sample EQ files that are installed by EQ in the samples folder.

3. Click Start Application in the Welcome dialog box.

4. Choose a SQL Server 7.0 data source in the ODBC Administrator dialog box that
  displays when you click Start Application.

5. Enter an English sentence to query into the main query dialog box. For
  example, enter the following query for the pubs database if you select
  Pubs.eqc in step 2:

  How many authors live in Oakland ?

6. Click Submit to run the query. The English Query parses the English statment
  to generate SQL language. The application uses ADO to submit the SQL
  statement to SQL Server. The DataGrid displays the results. Click Show SQL to
  see SQL language command sent to SQL Server.
