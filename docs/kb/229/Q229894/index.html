SYMPTOMS
========

When Client Services for NetWare (CSNW) opens Microsoft Office files, delays may

This problem occurs because CSNW continually resolves printer names, server
names, and object properties. This results in poor performance. The problem
becomes more pronounced as more and more clients perform the queries.
