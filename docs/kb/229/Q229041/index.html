SYMPTOMS
========

When you empty the Recycle Bin in Windows, the files may not be deleted from
your hard disk.

NOTE: You cannot view these files using Windows Explorer, My Computer, or the
Recycle Bin.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if a third-party filter driver is using the files you try
to delete.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, delete the files from an MS-DOS prompt. To do this,
follow these steps:

1. Click Start, click Run, type "cmd.exe" (without the quotation marks) in the
  Open box, and then click OK.

2. Change to the drive and folder where you deleted the files.

For example if you deleted a file from the C:\Windows folder, type "cd\windows"
(without the quotation marks) at the C: prompt, and then press ENTER.
3. From that folder type "cd recycler" (without the quotation marks), and then
  press ENTER.

4. From the Recycler folder type "dir" (without the quotation marks), and then
  press ENTER. You may see some User&lt;SID&gt; folders where &lt;SID&gt; is
  the security ID for each user who deleted files in that folder.

5. Type "cd user&lt;SID&gt;" (without the quotation marks), and then press
  ENTER.

6. Type "del *.*" (without the quotation marks), and then press ENTER. If you
  receive an error message that indicates some files are open, quit all the
  programs running on your computer.

7. Type "cd.." (without the quotation marks), press ENTER, and then repeat steps
  5-7 for each folder in the Recycler folder.

8. Type "exit" (without the quotation marks), and then press ENTER.
