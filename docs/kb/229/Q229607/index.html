-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create and delete files on an NTFS volume that holds more than 4
million files, you see file corruption that may show up in one of the following
ways:

- Deleted files continue to be displayed on the drive.

- Files that you have not deleted are no longer accessible.

- A pop-up message is displayed reporting that corruption has been detected on
  the drive and requesting that you run CHKDSK.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the Master File Table (MFT) has grown larger than 4 GB,
which may happen when you have more than 4 million files on your computer. When
you delete a file whose MFT entry is beyond the 4 GB point under these
conditions, an error in calculations causes the wrong entry to be marked as
available. If this entry contains information for another file, and new files
are added to the volume shortly after the deletion occurs, the entry could be
re-used causing the file it actually referenced to be lost.


RESOLUTION
==========

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Information on all files in an NTFS volume is stored in the MFT. The MFT
contains one or more an entries for all files on the system. In addition, the
MFT maintains empty or unused entries which can be used for newly created files.
When a file is deleted, it's entry is marked as being unused so that when a new
file is created, the file system can re-use the entry.
