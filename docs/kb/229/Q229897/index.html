  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use the OnlyDynRecs registry value to prevent
Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) static records from replicating to
replication partners.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

You can use WINS to add static records in the WINS database. Typically, static
records are difficult to remove from a network of WINS servers and are useful
only on the server to which a static record is added.

To prevent static record replication:

1. On the server you are configuring to not replicate static records, choose the
  "Replicate Only with Partners" option on the Advanced tab of the WINS server
  Configuration tool. This prevents unintended replication of static records
  from a server that is not configured as a replication partner.

2. Start Registry Editor.

3. Locate the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Wins\Partners\Push\&lt;partner
  IP address&gt;\OnlyDynRecs

  Data Type : REG_DWORD
  Range : 0 or 1
  Default : 0

4. Set the range to 1. This specifies that only dynamically registered records
  are replicated to WINS pulling replicas. The default setting of 0 specifies
  that all records (dynamic and static) are replicated.

5. Configure this for every push partner.

NOTE: If "replicate only with partners" was not checked in step one then it would
be possible for a server to pull records without being configured as a push
partner. This is not a desirable situation since we can only control static
record replication if the server is configured in the push partner list. Instead
you need to configure these servers as push partners, even if they are currently
only pulling.

6. Quit Registry Editor.

When a WINS server pulls from another server (either on its own or after being
triggered by a push notification from another server), the WINS server checks
the remote server's push partner registry key for the OnlyDynRecs value. If the
OnlyDynRecs value is set to 1, the pulling partner does not process static
records. If the OnlyDynRecs value is set to 0 or if it is not found, static
records are processed.
