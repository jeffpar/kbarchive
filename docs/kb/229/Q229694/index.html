SUMMARY
=======

The purpose of this article is to explain how to install, use, and remove the
IIS Security "What If" tool. The IIS Security "What If" tool is a Dynamic HTML
(DHTML) utility that is designed to help in troubleshooting security issues with
IIS.

NOTE: This utility requires a DHTML-enabled browser and has been tested with
Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 4.0 and 5.0. Although the tool works with
most DHTML-enabled browsers, Microsoft cannot guarantee compatibility with
third-party Web browsers. Therefore, this article has been written specifically
for use with Internet Explorer.
