The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2

SYMPTOMS
========

Machine Discovery properties are displaced by the most recent Network Discovery
DDR when two or more computers interchange between the same docking station
network adapter.

CAUSE
=====

Data Discover Manager is not capable of discriminating between different Network
Discovery DDR records generated by different computers interchanging between the
same pooled docking station network adapter.

The Network Discovery DDR contains only a subset of the properties used by other
discovery mechanisms - in particular, it lacks a globally unique identifier
(GUID) - and therefore relies on other properties to uniquely identify a
computer.

Data Discovery Manager uses only the IP address and the media access control
address to uniquely identify a Network Discovery DDR. Unfortunately, these
properties are not unique in situations where the network adapter is located in
a pooled docking station. Consequently, when a second computer uses the network
adapter of a docking station that has previously been discovered, and Network
Discovery runs, the NetBIOS name of the previously discovered computer is
supplanted by the second computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 and 2.0 SP1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Network Discovery is not supported in an environment that uses pooled network
adapters.
