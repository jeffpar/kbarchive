MORE INFORMATION
================

IMPORTANT: Before you perform the steps in this article, please make sure that

To completely remove Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 from a computer manually,
perform the following steps:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. In Control Panel, double-click Services, and then stop the Exchange Server
  system attendant. This stops all Exchange Server services.

2. Insert the Microsoft Exchange Server CD-ROM, click Install, and then click
  Remove All. Follow the instructions to remove all of the Exchange Server
  files that were installed during setup and were never modified.

  NOTE: If you are using Small Business Server 4.5, the Exchange setup program
  (setup.exe) is located on CD #3 under the Exchsrvr\Server\Setup\i386 folder.

3. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

4. Locate the following subkey in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/CurrentControlSet/Services

5. Delete all of the installed Exchange Server services. The following are the
  most commonly used Exchange Server services:

   - ESE97

   - MSExchangeDS

   - MSExchangeES

   - MSExchangeIMC

   - MSExchangeINS

   - MSExchangeIS

   - MSExchangeKMS

   - MSExchangeMTA

   - MSExchangeSA

  If other MSExchange services are present, delete them also.

6. Locate the following subkey in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Microsoft

7. Delete the three following subkeys:

   - EDB

   - ESE97

   - Exchange

8. When the following message is displayed, click Yes.

  Registry Editor may delete the currently selected key and all its subkeys.

9. Quit Registry Editor.

10. In Microsoft Windows NT Explorer, delete the Exchsrvr folder and all of the
  subfolders under this folder. If you have multiple hard disks on the
  computer, you need to delete the Exchsrvr folder from all of these hard
  disks.

  NOTE: If you are unable to delete the Exchsrvr folder, rename the Exchsrvr
  folder and then delete it.

11. Restart the Exchange server.
