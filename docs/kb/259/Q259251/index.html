-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade the Host Security feature to SNA Server 4.0 SP2 or SP3 using
the unattended installation method, the services start, but single sign on fails
to work.

In addition, the Setup program adds the following to the PATH statement:

  C:\Program Files\SNA\HSsystem

instead of the actual path where the files are installed, for example:

  E:\APPS\SNA\HSSystem

CAUSE
=====

During unattended installation, the user context that the Host Security services
use is determined by the LoginDomain and UserId parameters in the Snasetup.ini
file provided to the Host Security Setup program. However, the LoginDomain
parameter is ignored and the local domain is used instead, causing the services
to fail to work properly. Also, the PATH is updated incorrectly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, click the following article number to view the article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

This problem does not occur with the interactive installation of Host Security.
When this problem occurs after an unattended installation, you can resolve the
problem by manually changing the user context for the Host Security services to
the correct Windows NT domain. To do this, perform the following steps:

1. On the Windows NT or Windows 2000 computer where SNA 4.0 Host Security is
  installed, do one of the following:

   - For Windows NT, click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and
     then double-click Services.

  -or-

   - For Windows 2000, click Start, point to Settings, click Administrative
     Tools, and then double-click Services.

2. Select the following services (one at a time):

   - SNA Host Account Cache
   - SNA WinNT Account Synchronization

3. If you are running Windows NT, select Startup, and then set This Account to
  use the correct Windows NT domain context.

  If you are running Windows 2000, select the Log On folder, and then set This
  account to use the correct Windows NT domain context.

Also, manually set the PATH to the correct directory in the Environment folder in
Control Panel System.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version
4.0 SP3.

This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4.
