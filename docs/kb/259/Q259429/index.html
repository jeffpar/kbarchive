-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Outlook 2000 
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to view or delete a recurring appointment in Day/Week/Month view,
you may receive the following error message:

  Can't Open this item. The object could not be found.

CAUSE
=====

The form may be damaged.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, install the SwitchForms utility, install the
configuration files, and then run the SwitchForms utility.

Install the SwitchForms Utility
-------------------------------

To install the SwitchForms utility, follow the instructions on the following
Microsoft Web site:

  http://office.microsoft.com/downloads/9798/switchfm.aspx

The SwitchForms files are decompressed and installed in the Program
Files\Ork97\Outlook\Switchfm folder on your computer. Setup also creates a
SwitchForms utility menu item.

Install the Configuration Files
-------------------------------

The SwitchForms utility requires the form configuration files from the Microsoft
Exchange Client; the Microsoft Exchange Client Setup program installs the files
automatically.

The SwitchForms utility also requires the Microsoft Outlook 98 form configuration
files that are not installed with the Typical Setup option in Microsoft Office
or Outlook. To install the Outlook form configuration files:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
  Add/Remove Programs.

2. Click Microsoft Outlook 98, and then click Add/Remove.

3. Click Add New Components, and then click either Install From CD or Install
  From Web.

4. Click Development Tools, and then follow the instructions in the Install
  Wizard.

Run the SwitchForms Utility
---------------------------

1. Quit Outlook or the Microsoft Exchange Client.

2. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click SwitchForms to run the
  Regforms.exe program file.

3. In the Install Forms For box, click either Microsoft Exchange Client or
  Microsoft Outlook.

4. In the "Search for form configuration files" box, type the path to the form
  configuration files. You do not need to specify a full path because the
  SwitchForms utility searches the folder you specify and all of its
  subfolders. By default, The Microsoft Exchange Client form configuration
  files are installed in the C:\Windows\Forms\Configs folder. Outlook form
  configuration files are installed in the C:\Program Files\Microsoft
  Office\Office\Forms folder.

5. Click OK to configure your computer for the appropriate forms.

If you have Outlook or Microsoft Exchange Client files running on your computer,
you may receive error messages when you run the SwitchForms utility. To correct
this problem, restart your computer, and then run the SwitchForms utility
again.

If you receive the following error message when you run the SwitchForms utility,
install Electronic Forms Designer Runtime:

  Forms could not be found.

To install Electronic Forms Designer Runtime:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs, click Microsoft Office 2000, and then click
  Add/Remove.

3. Click Add Or Remove Features, and then click the plus sign (+) next to
  Microsoft Outlook for Windows.

4. Click the icon next to Electronic Forms Designer Runtime, click "Run from My
  Computer", and then click Update Now.

For additional information about installing Electronic Forms Designer Runtime,
click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q223488 OL2000: Error Message "The form you selected could not be displayed."

After you run the SwitchForms utility you receive a confirmation message. If you
do not receive the confirmation message, restart your computer and run the
SwitchForms utility again.
