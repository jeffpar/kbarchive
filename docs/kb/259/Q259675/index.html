-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Exchange Server Administrator program allows administrators to view
statistics of the mailboxes that belong to the users of that server by clicking
the Mailbox Resources tab (located in the Private Information Store properties).
One of the columns that is displayed on the Mailbox Resources tab is Total No.
Items, which is the total number of items that belong to a mailbox. At times,
there may be an inconsistency between the value that is listed in Total No.
Items on the Mailbox Resources tab and the total number of items that are
actually visible when you log on to this same mailbox with a client such as
Microsoft Outlook.

To repair this inconsistency, an administrator may run the Exchange Server
Information Store Integrity Checker (Isinteg.exe) in repair mode against the
server's private store. However, after the Isinteg utility finishes, the
inconsistency between the Mailbox Resources tab and the mailbox as displayed
from the client persists.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because the Exchange Server Information Store Integrity
Checker (Isinteg.exe) does not support the identification or correction of
inconsistencies in the Total No. Items column for mailboxes.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.

Microsoft scanned this file for viruses. Microsoft used the most current
virus-detection software that was available on the date that the file was
posted. The file is stored on secure servers that prevent any unauthorized
changes to the file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This fix is dependent upon build 5.5.2651.23 of the Store.exe program. If you
are running a build earlier than build 5.5.2651.23, first upgrade the version of
the Store.exe program to the latest build that is available. After you complete
the upgrade, start and stop the Exchange Server Information Store service to
allow for the schema upgrade that is made after build 5.5.2651.23. After the
schema upgrade is finished, run the Isinteg.exe utility by using the following
command line to correct the mailbox item counts:

  isinteg -pri -fix -detailed -l isinteg.log -test mailbox

The cause of the incorrectly incremented item count value has been identified and
corrected. Please note that this fix is included in the latest build of the
Store.exe program. Upgrade to the latest build of the Store.exe program that is
available, instead of the build that is listed in the following knowledge base
article:

  Q235528 XADM: Mailbox Item and Size Counts Are Incorrect

It is also important to note that many types of items are stored in a mailbox,
some of which are not visible in Outlook. The most common visible items are
messages, calendar entries, journal entries, task items, and contacts. However,
other types of objects are stored in the mailbox, such as views, that are not
visible. After you use the Isinteg utility to correct the item count values, a
discrepancy may still exist between the number of visible items and the mailbox
item count. This is to be expected.
