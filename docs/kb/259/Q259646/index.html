About the DateTimePicker Control
--------------------------------

The DateTimePicker control enables you to provide a formatted datetime field that
allows easy date or time selection. In addition, users can select a date from a
drop-down calendar interface similar to the MonthView control.

The DateTimePicker control operates in two modes:

- Drop-down Calendar mode (default) ? enables the user to display a drop-down
  calendar that can be used to select a date.
- Time Format mode ? enables the user to select a field in the date display
  (such as, the month, day, year, and so forth), and press the UP or DOWN arrow
  to the right of the control to set its value.

You can navigate to the control by using either the keyboard or the mouse. The
drop-down calendar has two buttons that enable you to scroll the months in and
out of view.

NOTE: The DateTimePicker control is part of a group of ActiveX controls that are
found in the Mscomct2.ocx file. To use the DateTimePicker control in your
application, you must add the Mscomct2.ocx file to the project. When you
distribute your application, install the Mscomct2.ocx file in the user's
Microsoft Windows System or System32 directory.

About This Sample
-----------------

This sample provides a form containing the DateTimePicker control along with
additional controls that allow you to manipulate the various properties on the
control and see the results. A number of the controls are set up as read-only
because the property they represent from the DateTimePicker control is
write-only. You can access the current date/time value from the Object.Value
property on the control or from the properties that correspond to the various
parts of a datetime value (Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute, Second, and so
forth).

With the DateTimePicker control you are able to specify a valid range of
datetimes as well as the format of the datetime value displayed in the control.
The formats available are Long Date (0), Short Date (1), Time (2), and Custom
(3). If the Custom format is specified, you can use the format characters
supported by the DateTimePicker control to customize the format to your needs.

NOTE: The CustomFormat property is case-sensitive. While the M and MM formats
refer to Months, the lower-case values m and mm refer to minutes. You also need
to note that h, hh, H, and H refer to hours; the lower case values h and hh
refer to hours in the twelve hour format, while the upper case H and HH refer to
hours in the twenty-four hour format.

As mentioned earlier, the DateTimePicker is able to operate in one of two modes
(Drop-Down Calendar or Time Format). This is controlled by the UpDown property.
When the UpDown property is set to True (.T.), the control is in Time Format
mode. This is evident by the appearance of the spinner-like buttons on the far
right of the control. In this mode, the user is able to select a part of the
datetime value (Month, Day, Year, Hour, Minute, and so forth) and spin through
the values until the desired datetime has been reached. When the UpDown property
is set to False (.F.) the control is in Drop-Down Calendar mode. This is evident
by the appearance of a drop-down button on the far right of the control. In this
mode, the time portion of the datetime value will not be changed.

NOTE: When the Format of the DateTimePicker control is set to Time (2), the
UpDown property is ignored and the control is in Time Format mode.

The DateTimePicker control can have a checkbox enabled in the control. When this
checkbox is clear (de-selected), the date and time values that are returned from
the control are .NULL. values.
