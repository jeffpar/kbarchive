-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Terminal Server client shuts down its session, Terminal Server may stop
responding (hang) with a "Stop 0x1E" error message on a blue screen. Typical
stop codes for Terminal Server with Service Pack 5 installed include:

  0x0000001e (0xc0000005, 0xa3079ce3, 0x00000000, 0x00000074)

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because all WindowStations for the session being terminated
have already been closed, but Terminal Server expects at least one WindowStation
to still be active.

==========

correct the problem that is described in this article. Apply it only to
