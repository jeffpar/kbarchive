SUMMARY
=======

DOMAINNAME[1Bh] entries sometimes are displayed differently in WINS Manager than
other entries. This article describes these differences and how to view [1Bh]
entries reliably.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a Windows NT 4.0 primary domain controller (PDC) registers with WINS, it
registers domain name record with a [1Bh} suffix. This is used for three main
functions in a Windows environment:

- For client password changes.

- For domain administration using tools like User Manager and Server Manager.

- To indicate the PDC as the Domain Master Browser for the domain that it
  belongs to.

Because Domain Master Browser must query WINS for a list of domains, [1Bh]
records are stored internally with the suffix at the front of the record instead
of the end to enable the WINS service to query the internal database faster.
Because of this, the [1Bh] entry is not displayed in WINS Manager when filtering
on the domain name using the Set Filter dialog box. It also will initially sort
near the top of the list shown under Mappings-Show Database and not be displayed
along with other entries for the domain.

It is often important to confirm that there is a correct [1Bh] entry in WINS. To
do this, use one or both of the following methods:

METHOD 1
--------

When you view the database under Mappings-Show Database, click the "Sort by IP
Address" option, and then click "Sort by Name" in the Show Database window. WINS
Manager will do a complete sort of the database, and [1Bh] entries will be
displayed along with other entries for the same domain name. Find the domain
name under Mappings and the DOMAINNAME[1Bh] should be listed along with the
other domain registrations.

METHOD 2
--------

Use the "Set Filter" option when you view the database, enter the IP address of
the PDC, and then leave the "Computer Name" blank. If this fails to show the
DOMAINNAME[1B] registration, then the method above should be used to verify
whether another IP address is registered for the [1Bh] entry.

Windows 2000 has an all new WINS Manager that sorts and displays [1Bh] entries
consistently without the exceptions listed above.
