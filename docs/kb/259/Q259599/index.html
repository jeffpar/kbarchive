-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you link a collection to another collection in the Systems Management
Server (SMS) Administrator console, there may be a long delay before the
populated Browse Collection window appears.

CAUSE
=====

The Administrator console uses a complex set of queries to populate the Browse
Collection window. It may take a long time to populate the window on a site with
many collections.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Apply it only to
computers that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive
additional testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server
service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The typical support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date     Size       File name     Platform
  ------------------------------------------
  4/10/00    538,624  Mmcbasui.dll  Intel
  4/10/00  1,006,864  Mmcbasui.dll  Alpha

NOTE: Due to file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that contains
the above files may also contain additional files.



The method that is used by the SMS Administrator console to link collections has
been optimized.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 SP2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, use the appropriate method.

Using the Hotfix Installer
--------------------------

NOTE: This method is for Intel-based site servers only. You must install this
update manually on remote SMS Administrator consoles.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a share on your network. Q259599.exe is a
  Microsoft Windows Installer file that updates specific files on your site
  server.

2. Log on to your site server using an account with administrative privileges.

3. On the site server, quit the SMS Administrator console.

4. Run Q259599.exe and follow the directions in the wizard. You can run the file
  in Quiet mode by using the /s switch.

Manual Installation
-------------------

To install the hotfix, follow these steps at the SMS site server:

1. Stop the SMS_EXECUTIVE and the SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER services.

2. Quit all instances of the Administrator console that are running on the site
  server.

3. Replace the Mmcbasui.dll file in the &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Bin\I386 folder with
  the version from the hotfix.

4. Start the SMS_EXECUTIVE and the SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER services.
