SUMMARY
=======

NOTE: The information in this article applies to Intel Pentium-class
processors.

The Intel Processor Frequency ID Utility was developed by the Intel Corporation
and is recommended for use with Intel Pentium class processors only. You can use
this utility to determine standard CPU identification of Intel Pentium
processors. The utility has an additional Frequency Test tab for the Pentium III
processor that can help you determine if a processor is being over clocked.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use this utility to identify and, in the case of the Pentium III
processor, determine if the processor is operating at the correct and rated
frequency as intended by the manufacturer. The Intel Processor Frequency ID
Utility is especially useful in situations where a computer's CPU type,
processor family, model, stepping, cache type, and cache size is unknown (and
regarding Pentium III computers, the operating frequency).

The original Intel Processor Frequency ID Utility is updated to support new
Pentium III, Mobile Pentium III, and Pentium III Xeon processors (version 2.01
can clock up to 800 MHz). You can download this utility from the following Web
site:

  http://support.intel.com/support/processors/tools/frequencyid/

You can download the Intel Processor Frequency ID Utility in a Windows version or
a bootable version. The Windows version of the utility operates with Microsoft
Windows 95, Microsoft Windows 98, Windows NT Versions 3.51 and later (including
all service packs).

NOTE: For successful installation and use with Windows NT, the user must have
system administrative rights.

The bootable version of the utility does not require an operating system to be
loaded to work. By installing the utility on a floppy disk drive or other
bootable device, the utility runs as the system is started, but before the
computer's operating system is loaded.
