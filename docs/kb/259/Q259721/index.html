SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a Microsoft Novell NetWare-compatible client such as GSNW, CSNW,
Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks, Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory
Services, and MSNDS, you may be unable to log on to Novell NetWare 5.x-based
servers, and you may receive one or more of the following error messages:

  Error: You cannot be authenticated on &lt;tree&gt;&lt;context&gt; due to the
  following reason: The network path was not found.

  Error: You are not logged in to the directory tree &lt;tree name&gt;.

  Error: An unexplained error occurred while your computer tried to access the
  network. For more information, contact your network administrator.

  Error: Failed to authenticate to server &lt;server name&gt;, attempting to
  connect bindery FFFFFD88 -632 error

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if your NetWare account was created or your password was
set from a Novell NetWare version 3.2 or 4.7 client. Because of a change in the
authentication process of the NetWare version 3.2 or 4.7 clients, non-Novell
clients can experience this issue.
