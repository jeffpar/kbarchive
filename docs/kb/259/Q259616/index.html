IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Outlook rules (for example, rules that automatically forward or reply
to an e-mail message) may not start on messages that are received from the
Internet.

This issue generally occurs with rules that act as a result of the recipient of
the message (the filter to determine whether the rule starts on a particular
e-mail message is dependant on the recipient).

This behavior occurs with recipients who have mailboxes that reside on the same
computer that the Internet Mail Service is on (the Internet Mail Service that
received the e-mail message). This behavior is typically seen on single-server
installations, or in organizations that use site connectors over the Internet
Mail Service.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because Outlook rules that are configured to act when the
recipient matches certain criteria (for example, if the e-mail message has the
recipient in the To line) actually check for the Exchange Server Distinguished
Name (DN) in the MAPI properties of the e-mail message.

When an e-mail message arrives from the Internet, and the e-mail message is
destined for a local recipient (on the same server), the e-mail message is
delivered locally, and the message transfer agent (MTA) does not touch the
e-mail message.

Normally, the MTA performs the resolution from Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
(SMTP) proxy address (the address that the e-mail message was sent to over the
Internet) to the Exchange Server DN. If the e-mail message does not pass through
the MTA, this resolution is not performed, and the rule does not start.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are several ways to work around this issue:

- You can use the client to work around this issue:

   - When you create a rule, do not specify the recipient, but do specify a
     portion of the name of the recipient that appears in both the Display name
     and the SMTP proxy address.

     For example, if a user's Display name is Kim Akers, and the user's SMTP
     proxy address is kim.akers@microsoft.com, configure the rule to check for
     a Recipient line that contains the following text:

  akers

- You can force messages through the MTA to work around this issue. Exchange
  Server 5.5 Service Pack 1 and later allow you to journal messages. You can
  use a feature that was added to support journaling to force the delivery of
  messages through the MTA:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

  2. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersSystem

  3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry
     value:

  Value Name: No Local Delivery
  Data Type: DWORD
  Value: 0x1

  4. Quit Registry Editor.

- You can force the Internet Mail Service to perform the directory lookup to
  work around this issue. In Exchange Server 5.5 you can use the Internet Mail
  Service ResolveP2 registry key to force the Internet Mail Service to resolve
  P2 recipients (which include To addressees on other systems and Cc
  addresses). In many cases this work around is the best option:
