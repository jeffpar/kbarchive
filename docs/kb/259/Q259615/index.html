SYMPTOMS
========

After you programmatically set the identity of a Component Object Model (COM)
server to a specific user account, when you attempt to activate the server, you
may receive an "Access Denied" error message. The following event appears in the
event log:

  EventID 10004 Source DCOM DCOM got error "Logon failure: unknown user name or
  bad password. " and was unable to logon redmond\comstud in order to run the
  server: {5e9ddec7-5767-11cf-beab-00aa006c3606}

This problem does not occur when you use DCOMCNFG.exe to configure the identity
of a COM server.

CAUSE
=====

When you programmatically set the identity of a COM server to a specific user
account, it stores the password of this account in a secure part of the
registry. This requires a call to the LsaStorePrivateData function.

The second argument to this function takes a LSA_UNICODE_STRING structure, which
is the name of the registry key where the private data is stored. One member of
this structure is Length. The LSA_UNICODE_STRING documentation states that the
length should not include the null terminator.

However, for COM to work, you must include the null terminator in the length.
When COM calls the LsaRetrievePrivateData function, the null terminator is
included as part of the key name where the private data is stored in the
registry. If the null terminator is not included in the length of the string,
the error occurs when you attempt to activate the COM server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, make sure that the null terminator is included in the
length of the LSA_UNICODE_STRING structure that represents the KeyName where the
password is stored.

The DCOMPerm sample illustrates how to programmatically set the identity of a COM
server to a specific account. Specifically, the SrvcMgmt.cpp file contains the
SetRunAsPassword function, which illustrates how to correctly set the password.

The DCOMPerm sample is included in the Platform Software Development Kit (SDK) in
the Samples\COM\Fundamentals\DCOM\DCOMPerm subfolder. This sample is also
located at the following Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) Web site:
