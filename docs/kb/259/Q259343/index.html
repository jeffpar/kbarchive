SYMPTOMS
========

The following events may be logged in the application event log regarding
non-delivery report (NDR) messages that are sent from a public folder:

   - Event Type: Warning
  Event Source: MSExchangeMTA
  Event Category: X.400 Service
  Event ID: 290
  Description:
  A non-delivery report (reason code unable-to-transfer and diagnostic code
  unrecognised-OR-name) is being generated for message C=US;A=
  ;P=ORGANIZATION;L=AANGBWAS012-000407193425Z-5. It was originally destined
  for DN:/o=ORGANIZATION/ou=SITE/cn=RECIPIENTS/cn=MAILBOX&lt;A7&gt;

  (recipient number 1), and was to be redirected to . [MTA DISP:RESULT

  Event Category: Transport Delivering
  Event ID: 2028

   - Event Type: Information
  Event Source: MSExchangeIS Private
  Event Category: Transport Delivering
  Event ID: 2025
  Date: 4/7/2000
  Time: 3:41:08 PM
  User: N/A
  Computer: AANGBWAS012
  Description:
  The delivery of a message failed due to error 8004010F. A non-delivery
  report is being sent to the message's originator.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if a moderated public folder or another rule that forwards
posts to Exchange Server mailboxes sends e-mail messages to specified accounts.
If an account is deleted, the rule still attempts to send the message and
generates an NDR and the events in the "Symptoms" section of this article.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, open the properties for the public folder in question
from a mailbox that has owner rights. Click the Administration tab, click
Moderated Folder, and then verify that any mailboxes in the To box are still
valid mailboxes. Click Folder Assistant, and then check any rules that are
created for the folder to ensure that all of the accounts that are listed are
valid.
