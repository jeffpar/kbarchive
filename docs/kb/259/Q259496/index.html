The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

On a shared computer, it may be possible for a malicious user to interactively
log on to the computer and compromise the security of the cryptographic keys of
other users who subsequently log on to the same computer.

CAUSE
=====

This vulnerability involves a registry key that is used to specify the
dynamic-link library (DLL) for a hardware accelerator in the default
Cryptographic service providers (CSPs) that are included with Cryptography
Application Programming Interface (CryptoAPI). By design, such a DLL has access
to users' public and private keys. Although only administrators should have
permission to add such a DLL, the permissions on the key could allow any user
who can interactively log on to the computer to do so. By writing a DLL and
installing it, a malicious user could compromise the keys of other users who
subsequently use the computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT 4.0

  Package

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this problem may cause a degree of security
vulnerability in Windows NT 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The computers primarily at risk are workstations and servers running Terminal
Server Edition. If you follow typical security recommendations, typical users
are not allowed to interactively log on to domain controllers, Web servers,
database servers, ERP servers, and other security-critical computers. A tool is
available that resets the permissions on the key to the correct default values.
In addition, it incorporates the functionality of the tool provided in Microsoft
Security Bulletin MS00-008 located at the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms00-008.asp

This issue affects only computers running Windows NT 4.0; it does not affect
computers running Microsoft Windows 2000.
