------------

The following list outlines the recommended hardware, software, network
infrastructure, and service packs that you will need:

- A Windows Web server that is running either Internet Information Server (IIS)
  4.0 or IIS 5.0.

- A root Web site (in this example, the default Web site).

- Administrative rights on the server computer.

Create the Content Folder
-------------------------

NOTE: If you have already created a content folder, skip this section and proceed
directly to section 3.

1. Right-click Start and click Explore to open Windows Explorer.

2. Select the drive in which you want to place the content folder for the new
  Web site.

3. Click File, point to New and click Folder.

4. When the folder is created, the title area will be highlighted. Type the name
  that you want to give the folder (such as Webcontent). Press ENTER.

5. Click File and click Close to close Windows Explorer.

Create the Virtual Website
--------------------------

- For IIS 4.0:

  1. Click Start, point to Programs, select Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack, point
     to Microsoft Internet Information Services and click Internet Services

  2. In the left pane, right-click Default Web Site, point to New, and then
     click Virtual Directory.

     for the site (such as Mywebsite) and click Next.

  4. In the second screen, click Browse. Browse to the content folder that you
     created in section 2 (in this example, it is Webcontent). Click Next.

  5. In the third screen, select Read and Run scripts (such as ASP). Make sure
     that the other check boxes are cleared. Click Finish to complete the
     wizard.

  6. Right-click the new virtual folder and click Properties.

  7. Click Virtual Directory and make sure that the Web site name is listed in
     the Application Name edit box under Application Settings. If it is not,
