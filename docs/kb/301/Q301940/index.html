SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to copy domain objects from one domain to another by
using the tools that are provided in the Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit
Supplement.

NOTE: It is recommended that you test the steps that are described in this
article in a test area before you use them in a production environment.

The Resource Kit tools are:

- The Addusers.exe tool can be used to import and export user and group
  accounts from one domain to another.

- The Rmtshare.exe tool can be used to remotely create or delete shares.

- The Scopy.exe tool can be used to copy NTFS file and folder permissions from
  one share to another. (This tool, however, does not copy share permissions.)

- The Permcopy.exe tool can be used to copy share permissions from one share to
  another.

- The Subinacl.exe tool can be used to obtain security information on files,
  registry keys, and services, and to transfer this information from user to
  user, from group to group, and from domain to domain.

  Q158388 Useful Resource Kit Utilities for Domain Administrators

To Migrate Users and Groups to Another Domain
---------------------------------------------

1. You can use the Addusers.exe tool to migrate users and groups to another
  domain. To transfer existing user and group accounts to a file, use the
  "addusers \\computer_name|domain_name/d filename" command, where
  "computer_name|domain_name" is the name of the primary domain controller
  (PDC) computer that contains the user and group information for the specified
  domain, and "filename" is the new file that contains the user and group
  account information.

  When the user and group information is transferred to a file, the information
  is saved in a comma-delimited format.

  This transfer of user account information does not save user account passwords
  or any security information to the file. When you use this transfer file to
  migrate users to another domain, all of the newly created user accounts have
  a blank password and, by default, all of the newly created users are required
  to change their passwords at their next logon sessions.

2. To add the users and groups to the new domain, use the "addusers
  \\computer_name|domain_name/c filename" command, where
  "computer_name|domain_name" is the name of the PDC computer and the domain
  where the user accounts are created, and "filename" is the name of the
  comma-delimited transfer file that contains the user and group information.

  NOTE: The Addusers.exe tool and additional documentation is included in the
  Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit, Supplement 3. To view the other parameters that
  you can use with this tool, at a command prompt, type: "addusers /?", and
  then press ENTER.

To Create Shares Remotely
-------------------------

To create or to delete shares on a remote server by using the Rmtshare.exe tool,
use a command with the following syntax:

  rmtshare \\server[\sharename[=path [/printer]]] [/grant [user[:perms ]]]
  [/remove user][/users:number] [/unlimited] [/remark:"text"] /delete

An explanation of the syntax of the preceding command is:

- The "\\server\sharename" syntax refers to both the server and the share that
  you can create, inspect, modify, or delete.

- The "/grant user:perms" syntax adds the name of a valid user or group on the
  server that have permissions, or changes the permissions of the user in an
  access control list. The valid permissions are: r=read, c=change (write),
  f=full, and n=none. You can type "read", but only the first character is
  used.

- The "/remove user" syntax removes the specific entry for a user. Then, that
  user inherits permissions (in contrast to "/grant user:none" that denies any
  access to the user).

- The "/users:number" syntax is the number of users that have privileges to the
  server and share.

- The "/delete" syntax deletes the share that are specified by the
  "\\server\sharename" syntax.

NOTE: If a sharename or path contains spaces, enclose either the sharename or
path in quotes, for example: \\server\"with space"="c:\with space".

To Copy File and Share Permissions
----------------------------------

Two tools are required to copy NTFS and share permissions: The Scopy.exe tool is
used to copy NTFS file and folder permissions, and the Permcopy.exe tool is used
to copy share permissions.

To copy files and folders, and retain their NTFS file and folder permissions, use
the Scopy.exe tool and the "scopy source destination/o /a /s" command, where
"source" is the path to the source folder and "destination" is the path to the
destination folder. The /o option copies the owner security information, /a
copies the auditing information, and /s includes all of the files in the
subfolders.

The Scopy.exe tool cannot copy files to or from file systems that do not use
security features, such as, file allocation table (FAT) and high-performance
file system (HPFS). The Scopy.exe tool copies only NTFS file system security
information. This tool cannot be used to copy share permissions.

To copy the share permissions from one share to another by using the Permcopy.exe
tool, use the "permcopy \\source_server\share_name
\\destination_server\share_name" command, where "source_server\share_name" and
"destination_server\share_name" are the universal naming convention (UNC) paths
to the source and destination shares.

NOTE: You cannot use the Permcopy.exe tool to copy the permissions of an
administrative share (sharename$, such as, C$ or IPC$). If you copy the
permissions to an administrative share that is located on an x86-based computer,
the Services.exe program can stop responding.

To Migrate Registry Keys, Services, and Other Objects
-----------------------------------------------------

The Subinacl.exe tool can be used to obtain security information on files,
directories, registry keys, and services, and to transfer this information from
user to user, from group to group, and from domain to domain.

To migrate other domain objects by using the Subinacl.exe tool, use a command
with the following syntax:

  subinacl /object_type object_name /action=parameter /action=parameter

The object types that can be manipulated by the Subinacl.exe tool include:

- Registry keys and subkeys

- Files

- Directories

- Shares

- Services

- Kernel objects

The actions that can be performed on the preceding objects include:

- Display

- Change ownership

- Replace all access control entries in the object

- Change domain name of the object

- Migrate the object from one domain to another

An Example:

To replace the security identifiers in all access control entries that contain
"Domain1\Sales" with those of "Domain2\Sales", use the Subinacl.exe tool, and
the following command:

  subinacl /replace=domain1\sales=domain2\sales

For more information about the syntax and the use of these tools, refer to the
Rktools.hlp file in Windows NT Server 4.0 Resource Kit Supplement 3.
