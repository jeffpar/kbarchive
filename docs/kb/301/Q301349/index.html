The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Server Appliance Kit (SAK), version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A properly constructed setup/.msi package is created and runs normally. However,
when packaged as part of a software update-compatible .cab file and then
uploaded to the server appliance, the package is not installed.

CAUSE
=====

When the software update is in progress on the server appliance, the entire
process is being run under the local system account of Windows NT
AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.

This is not the case when the software update is run in interactive mode by a
user, and as a result certain switches/parameters must be passed to MSIEXEC for
proper operation.

The software update feature is designed to be used in a headless environment in
which a user is not capable of interacting with the setup process. Therefore,
any part of a software update process that requires interaction from the user
during installation will cause the setup to stop responding ("hang").

RESOLUTION
==========

In the software update .inf file, it is important to specify launch conditions
for the .msi package being used. Specifically, the installation should be run in
one of the following ways:

- Run the setup in quiet mode. Do not request user input or show pop-up dialog
  boxes. This can be accomplished by passing the /qn switch to the input. For
  example:

   - For InstallShield Setup.exe: Setup.exe /V"/qn"

   - For MSIExec .msi files: Msiexec.exe /i default.msi /qn

- Run the setup such that all package information is stored at the system
  level, rather then a per-user level. This can be done by passing the MSI
  directive: ALLUSERS = 1. For example:

   - For InstallShield Setup.Exe: Setup.exe /V"ALLUSERS=1"

   - For MSIExec .msi files: Msiexec.exe /i ALLUSERS=1

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following example is the recommended way to set up the Info.inf file
included in the software update .cab so that it will work in quiet mode, and
specify ALLUSERS=1. The example uses an InstallShield-built Setup.exe:

  InstallCommand="&lt;setup.exe&gt; /V""ALLUSERS=1 /qn"""

  where &lt;setup.exe&gt; is the name of the setup executable file being used.
