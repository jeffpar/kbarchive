SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article describes how to view or change IIS Authentication
methods.

Requirements
------------

The following describes the necessary stuff that you will need:

- Windows 2000 Professional, Windows 2000 Server, and Windows 2000 Advanced
  Server
- Internet Information Server 5.0

View or Change Authentication Methods
-------------------------------------

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and click
  Internet Services Manager.

2. In the console tree (left pane) of Internet Information Services, browse to
  the Web site that you want to work with.

3. Right-click this Web site and click Properties.

4. Click the Directory Security tab.

5. Under Anonymous Access and Authentication Control, click Edit.

6. In the Authentication Methods dialog box, select one or more appropriate
  methods.

7. Click OK twice to exit the Web site Properties page and return to the
  Internet Information Services console.

Troubleshooting
---------------

- Enabling Basic authentication does not automatically configure your Web
  server to authenticate users. Windows user accounts must be created and the
  Windows NT file system (NTFS) permissions must be properly set. The
  disadvantage is that Web browsers that use Basic authentication transmit
  passwords in an unencrypted form. By monitoring communications on your
  network, someone can easily intercept and decipher these passwords by using
  publicly available tools. Therefore, Basic authentication is not recommended
  unless you are confident that the connection between the user and your Web
  server is a secure connection, such as a direct cable connection or a
  dedicated line.

- Integrated Windows authentication does not work across CERN compliant proxy
  servers (such as MS Proxy 2.0). It does work with some firewall applications
  (such as ISA).

- Digest authentication is supported only for domains with a Windows 2000
  domain controller. Digest authentication completes only if the domain server
  for which a request is made has a plain-text copy of the requesting user's
  password. Because the domain controller has plain-text copies of passwords,
  it must be secured from both physical and network attacks. For more
  information about securing a domain controller, click the link to the
  Microsoft Windows 2000 Server Resource Kits in the "References" section.
  Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5.0 is the only browser that currently
  supports Digest authentication.
