The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A file that is saved in UTF-8 encoding usually has a byte-order mark (BOM) at
the beginning of the file. IIS treats the three BOM bytes (EF, BB, and BF) as
part of the data, which may cause various errors.

For instance, the following Microsoft Visual Basic script saved in UTF-8 encoding
causes a "Statement expected" error on the "Option explicit" line to occur.
Because of the BOM, the VB script engine is unable to parse the code.

  &lt;%@ Language=VBScript CODEPAGE=65001%&gt;&lt;%
  Option explicit
  ......

IIS should remove the BOM before processing the data.

==========
