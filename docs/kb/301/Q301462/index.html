SYMPTOMS
========

On a computer that is running Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 Service

(Standard) locale, the Required Encryption setting in Terminal Server Connection
Configuration under the Advanced setting of the RDP-TCP connection may be
unavailable.

==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition service pack that
contains this fix.
