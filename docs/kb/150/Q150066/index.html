SYMPTOMS
========

On a 16-bit Windows client, after you run a shared application and log off
(without exiting Windows), when you log on again, Program Group Control will
attempt to configure the shared applications. If you are using Smsls.bat in or
as your login script, you may be executing the SMS login script at the same time
PGC is configuring the shared applications. As a result you may get one or more
of the following errors:

  Sharing Violation on Drive C: Abort, Retry, Fail

  Could not open the application database. Your configuration will not be
  updated this time

  Failed to find Domain Controller. Cannot determine which groups the user
  belongs to. Please contact your administrator.

  There is a network error

PGC will fail to configure the shared applications and will not create the
program groups.

CAUSE
=====

Which error occurs seems to depend on how much of the login script has executed
when PGC starts its configuration. PGC waits 1 second after it detects that a
user has logged on before beginning its configuration.

WORKAROUND
==========

Manually run PGC after the login script has completed. If PGC is executed
manually immediately after the script has completed, it will succeed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
