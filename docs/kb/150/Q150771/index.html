-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article contains comments, corrections, and information on known errors
relating to the Microsoft Press book "Learn Visual Basic Now."

The following topics are covered:

- CD-ROM: Setup.exe File Not Found

- VB WORKING MODEL: Unable to load 2 form projects

MORE INFORMATION
================

In addition to a description of the book's problems, each entry in this document
might also include sections labeled "Correction" and "Comments." Please note
that the "Correction" section is worded for correcting the book and does not
necessarily address the problem introduced by the book error. The "Comments"
section contains specific information for working around the problem.

CD-ROM:  Setup.exe File Not Found
---------------------------------

Symptom:

On computers running Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 and some configurations of
Microsoft Windows 95, running the CD-ROM Setup program returns the following
error:

  File not found.

Furthermore, changing to different directories on this CD-ROM produces unexpected
results, including the apparent disappearance of the directory. The only file
that opens properly is the README.TXT file.

CAUSE
=====

The CD-ROM for the Microsoft Press book titled "Learn Visual Basic Now" was
duplicated using long filenames and filenames containing spaces and lowercase
letters.

The ISO 9660 specification, which is a long-standing CD-ROM file system (CDFS)
specification, does not allow spaces or lowercase letters in filenames.
Microsoft Windows NT 3.51 and MS-DOS (with or without Windows 3.1) cannot read
CD-ROM filenames that contain spaces or lowercase letters. However, Microsoft
Windows 95 extends the CDFS to allow spaces, lowercase letters, and long
filenames by using CD-ROM drivers designed for this capability.

Because Windows 95 permits extended CD-ROM filenames, it does not have problems
reading the CD-ROM for this book. However, Windows 95 configurations that use
MS-DOS (or real mode) CD-ROM drivers will not be able to access the extended
CD-ROM filenames on this CD-ROM.

WORKAROUND
==========

For Windows 95, the best method of correcting this problem is to obtain a
Windows 95 CD-ROM driver. Please contact your CD-ROM manufacturer for the latest
drivers for your model CD-ROM.

Microsoft Press has also created a replacement pack containing both a CD-ROM and
a 3.5-inch disk for "Learn Visual Basic Now." This replacement pack will work
properly with all configurations of Windows 95 and Windows NT 3.51.

To obtain a free copy of this replacement pack, please call Microsoft Press at
(800) MS-PRESS and request a replacement CD-ROM (part number 097-0001533) for
the Microsoft Press book titled, "Learn Visual Basic Now". Outside the United
States, please send e-mail to MSPINPUT@MICROSOFT.COM for further information.

VB WORKING MODEL: Unable to load projects with 2 forms
------------------------------------------------------

"Learn Visual Basic Now," page 212, provides steps for saving a project that
contains two forms. However, the following error occurs when you attempt to load
this or any other two-form project using the Visual Basic Working Model:

  You may only load or create projects with two
  modules (Forms, MDI Forms, Modules, Classes)
  in the Visual Basic Working Model.

  Projects may contain an unlimited (system
  dependent) number of modules in other
  versions of Visual Basic 4.0.

Comments:

The Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0 Working Model that is included with "Learn Visual
Basic Now" is unable to load projects with two forms.

To circumvent this limitation:

1. Create a new project.

2. Click the File menu, and then select Remove File.

3. Click the File menu, then select Add File. Change to the proper directory,
  and double-click the first form you want in the project.

4. Repeat step 3 for the second form you want in the project.

After performing these steps, you will have a two-form project loaded and ready
to be worked with. This project can be tested, modified, or compiled into an
executable as normal.

Microsoft Press is researching this issue and will place any new information in
this article.

Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
already contain most or all of the above corrections.
