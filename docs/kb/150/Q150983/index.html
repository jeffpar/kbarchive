-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
- Microsoft Graph 5.0 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a PowerPoint slide that contains a Microsoft Graph picture with
patterned fills, the patterns may not print correctly, or they may not print at
all.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Graph 5.0 renders its pattern fills at the resolution of the output
device, whether it is printer or display. The patterns are defined by a GDI
brush 8 x 8 pixels in size. On a display that has a dpi of 96, Graph 5.0 will
render its patterns at 96 dpi, repeating the pattern 12 times per inch. If
printed from a printer capable of printing at 600dpi, the pattern is repeated 75
times per inch. Because of this, the pattern is so small you can barely see it.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior under, use either of the following methods.

Method 1: Paste the Graph into PowerPoint as a Bitmap
-----------------------------------------------------

To paste the graph into Powerpoint as a bitmap, follow these steps:

1. After you create your graph, return to PowerPoint 95, and click the graph.

2. On the Edit menu, click Copy.

3. On the Start menu, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then click
  Microsoft Paint. In Microsoft Paint, follow these steps:
  a. On the Image menu, click Attributes.

  b. Set the Width to 1 and the Height to 1, and then click OK.

  c. On the Edit menu, click Paste.

     A message appears asking if the image in the clipboard is larger than the
     bitmap. Click Yes.

  d. On the Edit menu, click Copy.

4. Switch to your program.

5. On the Insert menu, click New Slide, and then click a blank slide from the
  New Slide dialog box.

6. On the View menu, click Zoom, click 100%, and click OK.

7. On the Edit menu, click Paste.
  This pastes a bitmap picture of your graph into the new slide.

8. On the Draw menu, click Scale. In the Scale To box, click to select 100%, and
  make sure the "Relative to original picture size" check box is selected.

  Now you can print this slide and the patterns are visible (the way they appear
  on the screen). You can click Hide on the Tools menu to hide this slide
  during your slide show presentation, but when you print your slides, you
  should print this slide instead of the one containing the original graph.

Method 2: Set the Printer Resolution to 75 Dots Per Inch
--------------------------------------------------------

Set the printer resolution on your printer driver to 75 dots per inch (DPI). If
you are printing with a Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet 4, you must use an HP III
printer driver to achieve this effect.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Graph 5.0 for Windows.
