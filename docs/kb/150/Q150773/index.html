SUMMARY
=======

Some rare configurations of Windows 95 will cause the Step by Step Setup program
to fail when copying files to the hard disk. The result is that the installed
files will be present, but some will have a file size of zero bytes. To correct
this problem, rerun Setup in Microsoft Windows 95 Safe Mode. (See below for
detailed steps.)


SYMPTOMS
========

This setup issue affects several Microsoft Press Step by Step books for Windows
95-based applications. The following list contains common symptoms of zero-byte
practice files:

Common Symptoms
---------------

- Error, "Unrecognized database format C:\Access SBS Practice Sweet\Lil's.mdb."
  ("Microsoft Access for Windows 95 Step by Step")

- Error, "Not a valid table." ("Microsoft Visual FoxPro 3 Step by Step")

- Blank document opened ("Microsoft Word for Windows 95 Step by Step")

To determine whether the Practice files were copied as zero-byte files:

1. Follow the step in the first lesson that describes how to open a practice
  file (usually one of the first two lessons). However, do not perform the
  final step that actually opens the practice file.

2. When you get to the Open dialog box and you see the practice files, click the
  Details button on the top row (the fifth button along the top row).

Once the Details button is clicked, you will see the file size for each practice
file. If any files have a file length of 0 KB (zero kilobytes), the Setup
program unsuccessfully installed the practice files.

WORKAROUND
==========

To Run Setup in Windows 95 Safe Mode
------------------------------------

1. Close all Windows 95 programs that are currently on the task bar (next to the
  Start button).

2. Click Start, and then click Shut Down. In the Shut Down Windows dialog box,
  select Restart Windows and click OK.

3. Press the F5 function key on the keyboard four or five times when the
  computer beeps during the restart.

  Pressing F5 while the computer is starting up will cause Windows 95 to run in
  Safe Mode. This mode avoids running any extra software that might conflict or
  cause system problems. Safe Mode also uses the 640x480 screen resolution with
  16 colors, so your screen might look larger and the background colors might
  be different while running in Safe Mode.

4. A message will display stating that Windows 95 is running in Safe Mode. Click
  OK to remove this message.

5. Run the Setup program from the Step by Step Practice Files disk. (See the
  "Getting Ready" section of your Step by Step book for specific
  instructions.)

  NOTE: Because this is the second installation, Setup will ask whether you want
  to overwrite the previous version of the files being installed. Click Yes To
  All to overwrite the original (zero-byte) files.

6. When Setup has been completed successfully, click Start, and then click Shut
  Down. In the Shut Down Windows dialog box, select Restart Windows and click
  OK.

  The computer will start in Normal mode after performing step 7. Now that the
  Setup program has been run without potential system interference, the
  Practice Files will be correctly installed and will be accessible as
  described in the Step by Step book.

  Running Setup in Safe Mode will not disturb any prior practice file work.
  Because the practice files are overwritten, there is no need to uninstall the
  previous installation.

Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books.
