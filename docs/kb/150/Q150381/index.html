Overview
--------

The Microsoft Internet Explorer 1.5 for Windows NT is an early release
primarily intended for users of Microsoft Windows NT versions 3.1, 3.5 or
3.51 who are connected to a local area network (LAN). This product will
enable you to browse and view HTML documents on the network, in addition to
documents on the World Wide Web or Internet, provided your network is
connected to the Internet. Other services, such as Gopher and FTP, are also
available.

If you are not on a LAN, but have an existing TCP/IP connection, Remote
Access Services (RAS) or a SLIP/PPP account with an Internet service
provider (ISP), you can also use this product. Instructions for installing
Internet Explorer 1.5 for Windows NT on your system are provided below.
Also, future versions of Internet Explorer will include all the software
you need to establish new accounts (TCP/IP protocol stack and ISP account
registration software).

System Requirements
-------------------

- TCP/IP Stack
  A TCP/IP network protocol stack is required to access the Internet. As
  mentioned above, this version of Internet Explorer requires that these
  components be installed before you run Internet Explorer.

- Network Connection
  A SLIP/PPP, direct, or other Winsock-compatible network connection is required
  to access the Internet through an ISP. As mentioned above, this version of
  Internet Explorer requires that these components be installed before you run
  Internet Explorer.

Download and Installation Instructions
--------------------------------------

1. Starting at http://www.microsoft.com/ie/ choose "Free Microsoft Internet
  Explorer" and then your OS and platform.

2. Click the link that is applicable to your platform and save the file on your
  hard disk.

3. In File Manager, double-click the downloaded file (e.g., msie15i386.exe) to
  begin the install process.

4. Read the notes below for LAN installations and for installing with existing
  TCP/IP connections.

5. Run Internet Explorer.

LAN Installations
-----------------

After completing the steps outlined above, you should be ready to use
Internet Explorer over your LAN. If you encounter any problems, consult
your network administrator.
Proxy servers can also be used, provided they are CERN compliant. To enable
use of a proxy server, choose the View menu in Internet Explorer, and then
choose Set Proxy Server. Then check the Use Proxy Server box. Type the
proxy server name in the location provided. name and port number of your
proxy server.

Installations with Existing TCP/IP Connections and ISP Accounts
---------------------------------------------------------------

Internet Explorer has been tested with several of the most popular Internet
access products available today. If it is configured properly, you should
be able to use the TCP/IP stack and dialer (via wsock32.dll) provided with
these products to connect through your ISP. In general, all that is
required is that you configure your PATH command in  Autoexec.bat so that
Internet Explorer can find the wsock32.dll file you are using to connect to
the Internet.

Release Notes
-------------

features and functionality included in the Internet Explorer 2.0 for
