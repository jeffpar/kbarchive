SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to restore data using SQL Load on a Tandberg 1.2-gigabyte (GB)
drive, and the data has been backed up using SQL Dump with a WangTEK 525-
megabyte (MB) drive, the load fails.

CAUSE
=====

The Tandberg and WangTEK drives both produce outputs in QIC tape format. In the
case described above, the load fails because the Tandberg drive reports the tape
to be blank when data is really present.

The Tandberg drive has a new formatting feature called "setmarks," in addition to
the old "filemarks" format. When the data was backed up using the WangTEK drive,
filemarks format was used by the SQL Dump utility.

On the restore, the SQL Load utility defaulted to the new setmarks format when
the Tandberg drive reported both formats were available. Requesting setmarks
data from a filemarks formatted tape produced a result of "no data available."

RESOLUTION
==========

As a temporary workaround to this problem, a modified tape driver is available.
This driver reports filemarks only as available from the Tandberg drive.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server versions 3.5
and 3.51 and Microsoft SQL Server versions 4.21a, 6.0, and 6.5. A supported fix
is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and should be applied
only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are severely
impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the
next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Product Support
Services for more information.
