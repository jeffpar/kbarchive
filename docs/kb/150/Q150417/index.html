The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Create a form that contains the Sheridan SSTab control, and child controls on
each of the tabs. When the form is in read-only mode (common when using Visual
SourceSafe to control the project) and the user selects each tab to display it,
the only child controls displayed are those controls which were on the original
tab.

In addition, if you specify a File, Save File menu item on the form (after moving
from tab to tab) one of the following two error messages (depending on whether
there is a .FRX file associated with the form or not) displays one of the
following error messages:

  Path/File access error: '&lt;location of form file&gt;.FRX'

  Path/File access error: '&lt;location of form file&gt;.FRM'

CAUSE
=====

The Sheridan Tab control actually changes the Left property of the specific tab
child controls to make them appear and disappear. The Left property of all the
child controls on the previously shown tab are changed by -75000. The Left
property of all child controls on the newly selected tab is changed by +75000.
Visually, it appears that the tab control is properly displaying its children.

However, when the form is in read-only mode, the Left property cannot be
modified. Therefore, the controls do not change as they should.

STATUS
======

This Sheridan Tab control behavior is by design.

WORKAROUND
==========

Check out the form with the SSTab control (make the file read/write). Then the
control behaves as you would expect.

Sheridan has created an update for the 32-bit control, which corrects many of
these problems. The update, tabctl32.exe, can be downloaded from their Web site
at www.shersoft.com.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Start Visual Basic 4.0. Form1 is created by default.

2. Place the Sheridan tab (SSTab) on Form1.

3. Add at least one control to each of the tabs on the form. Place the controls
  in unique locations on each tab, so when tabbing from tab to tab, it is
  obvious which controls are on which tabs.

4. Tab through each of the tabs and see what controls are on which tabs.

5. Save the project via the File, Save Project option and add the project to
  Source Code Control when asked.

6. Double-click on Form1 to display the form. Select each tab and watch the
  behavior on the controls. The controls are not changing as you would expect
  them to.

7. Try to save the form via the File, Save File option. One of the following two
  error messages displays:

  Path/File access error: '&lt;location of form file&gt;.FRX'

  -or-

  Path/File access error: '&lt;location of form file&gt;.FRM'
