-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article is aimed at providing a way to join a domain from a command line.
This can be achieved with the NETDOM command line utility included in Windows NT
4.0 Resource Kit Supplement 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: The solution included in this article has not been extensively tested
in large installations. Microsoft cannot guarantee that modifications of domains
as recommended herein will accomplish the objective described in this article
under all circumstances and in all configurations.

For the purpose of this article, assume MYDOMAIN is the name of the domain and
MYCOMPUTER is the name of the workstation or stand-alone server that is joining
the domain.

NETDOM lets you join a domain from the command line. This can apply to Windows NT
workstations and standalone servers.

If you are the administrator of the domain
------------------------------------------

If you have administrative access to the primary domain controller (PDC) (such as
through an user account member of the Local Administrators or Domain
Administrators groups,) NETDOM automatically creates the computer account if
necessary.

You may run the following command (in a single line):

  NETDOM /Domain:MYDOMAIN /user:adminuser /password:apassword MEMBER
     MYCOMPUTER /JOINDOMAIN

The command line above may be run on any computer as soon as you have
administrative access to the computer MYCOMPUTER. If you are already logged on
to the domain with an administrator account, then the options /DOMAIN, /USER and
/PASSWORD are not required.

If you are not an administrator of the domain
---------------------------------------------

If you do not have administrative access to the PDC of the domain then you must
ask the administrator to add a computer account for your computer member.

The computer account can be created as follows:

  NETDOM /Domain:MYDOMAIN /user:adminuser /password:apassword MEMBER
     MYCOMPUTER /ADD

Then act as follows to join the domain.

  NETDOM /Domain:MYDOMAIN MEMBER MYCOMPUTER /JOINDOMAIN

If the workstation or the stand-alone server was already in the domain the secure
channel is checked.
