The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 4.0, 4.1

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the nmake utility to build a project containing a subproject of
type makefile that does not use nmake as its command, the subproject is not
built. However, the subproject can be built from Developer Studio.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two ways to resolve the problem:

- Build the project and sub-project separately. This requires either typing in
  a batch file or makefile that calls nmake once for each configuration.

-or-

- When you insert a project of type makefile, rather than changing the Command
  line to execute something other than nmake, specify a makefile which you
  create. Then create a makefile that executes the command you would use
  instead of nmake.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

Method 1:

1. Open the MFC sample DLLHusk.

2. From Insert menu, choose Project.

3. Select type Makefile, give it a generic name, and select it as a subproject
  of DLLHusk.

4. Click the Create button. Remove the line "NMAKE /f" from the general tab of
  subproject generic, and type:

     c:\msdev\samples\mfc\advanced\dllhusk\generic\generic.bat

  The batch file generic.bat is executed for the inserted subproject build.

Method 2:

1. Create a batch file named Generic.bat in the subproject directory generic.

2. Add some REM lines in the batch file to verify that this file is being used
  in the build process, or you can add commands to build one of your other
  projects by using NMAKE.

Method 3:

From the Build menu of Developer Studio, build or rebuild your toplevel project
DLLHusk. Note that the subprojects TestDll1 and TesDll2 are built, the generic
project is built, and then the toplevel project DLLHusk is built.

Method 4:

1. Go to a Command prompt.

2. Run Vcvars32.bat from the Msdev\Bin directory.

3. Move to the DLLHusk project directory, and run this command:

     NMAKE /A /F  DLLHusk.mak CFG="DLLHusk - Win32 Debug"

  NOTE: The subprojects TestDll1 and TesDll2 are built, and the toplevel project
  DLLHusk is also built. However, the generic project is not built.

Example Resolution
------------------

To implement the first resolution from the Resolution section of this article,
follow these steps:

1. Create a batch file in the toplevel project directory. In this example, the
  toplevel project directory is the Dllhusk directory.

2. Add the following lines to the batch file, and name it Dllhusk.bat assuming
  C: as the root directory:

     call generic\generic.bat
     REM If current directory and environment variables got changed
     call c:\msdev\bin\vcvars32.bat
     cd c:\msdev\samples\mfc\advanced\dllhusk
     nmake %1 /D /F dllhusk.mak CFG=%2

3. From the Dllhusk directory, run the following command from the Command line:

     dllhusk /A "DLLHusk - Win32 Debug"

This command builds all the subprojects and the toplevel project.
