******************************************
* README.TXT for Object Navigator Update 1
* updated 4/30/96
******************************************

SUMMARY
-------

If you installed the Object Navigator from the CD that came with
the first printing of "Object Programming with Visual Basic 4,"
then this patch has fixes for bugs listed below.

The following topics are covered:

- PATCH FILES LIST
- INSTALLATION
- BUGS FIXED

PATCH FILES LIST
----------------

OBJNAVU1.EXE  Self-extracting executable (download-only). Contains:

  README.TXT  (This file) Describes patch and installation
  ObjNav.EXE  Replacement executable patch for the Object Navigator
  UPDATE.BAT  Default installation batch file

INSTALLATION
------------

To automatically update the Object Navigator in Windows 95, Click Start,
and then click Run and type the following command:

  UPDATE.BAT

NOTE:  The above batch file assumes that the Object Navigator is
installed in the default directory.

To update the Object Navigator manually, copy the new ObjNav.EXE
replacement file to the Object Navigator directory.
By default the destination directory is

     C:\Program Files\Object Navigator\ 

No other files need to be changed. Note that the ObjNav.Exe file alone
isn't sufficient to run the Object Navigator. If you downloaded
this patch to your hard disk, you can remove the files listed above
from your download directory after installing the update.

BUGS FIXED
----------

This Object Navigator update addresses the following problems
(*=possible crash, **=always crash):

* 1) In object-centric mode with the return type locked, double-clicking
in the Objects list either emptied the list or produced bogus results.
This could potentially crash.

  2) Releasing the Returned Objects list lock in object-centric mode
produced unpredictable library names in the Objects list.

  3) On an unsuccessful search, moving the message box and closing it
completely blanked out the top pane (except for the listboxes).

**4) Deleting a link and then using the drag rectangle to select nodes
crashed when the mouse was moved outside the code pane while the drag
rectangle was visible.

* 5) Touching any splitter bar or a search button in move mode produced
a bogus and dangerous state. (A node was editable, but clicking in the
lists had no effect.)

  6) Moving a message box around erased parts of the background window.

  7) Clicking in the right (values) list of the parameters pane on a
partially obscured last item caused the selection to be drawn wrong in
the parameters list.

  8) Clicking to put the focus in the parameters window or an empty
libraries window did not show a blank focus rectangle.

  9) On some machines, dragging a splitter bar over the ? button caused
the description field to act up.
