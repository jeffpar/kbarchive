SUMMARY
=======

This article contains questions and answers about Microsoft DirectX version 1.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Q. What is Microsoft DirectX?

  A. Microsoft DirectX is a set of drivers that is available with the Microsoft
  Game Software Development Kit (SDK).

2. Q. What components make up Microsoft DirectX?

  A. DirectX components include DirectDraw, DirectInput, DirectPlay, and
  DirectSound. DirectDraw and DirectSound components replace current Windows 95
  display and sound drivers with DirectX drivers.

3. Q. How do I obtain Microsoft DirectX?

  A. If you develop computer games and you want to provide DirectX functionality
  within your game, you need the Microsoft Game SDK. The Game SDK is available
  on the Microsoft Developer's Network (MSDN) Level 2 CD-ROM.

  Independent software vendors (ISVs) who use these components in their games
  can redistribute them.

4. Q. What is DirectDraw?

  A. DirectDraw allows direct access of video display memory, hardware blitters,
  hardware overlays, and page flipping. DirectDraw provides this functionality
  while maintaining compatibility with existing Windows 95-based programs and
  device drivers.

  Essentially, DirectDraw is a memory manager for video memory. Using
  DirectDraw, a program can manipulate video memory with ease, taking full
  advantage of the blitting and color decompression capabilities of different
  types of video hardware without becoming dependent on a particular piece of
  hardware.

5. Q. What is DirectInput?

  A. The Microsoft DirectInput application programming interface (API) provides
  fast and consistent access to analog and digital joysticks. The DirectInput
  API maintains consistency with the joystick APIs of the Microsoft Win32
  Software Development Kit (SDK), but has improved responsiveness and
  reliability by changing the device driver model. DirectInput device drivers
  also use the registry to store settings for standard joysticks, calibration
  information for previously configured joysticks, and settings for
  OEM-supplied joysticks.

6. Q. What is DirectPlay?

  A. The Microsoft DirectPlay application programming interface (API) for
  Windows 95 is a software interface that simplifies game access to
  communication services. DirectPlay provides a way for games to communicate
  with each other that is independent of the underlying transport, protocol, or
  online service.

7. Q. What is DirectSound?

  A. The Microsoft DirectSound application programming interface (API) is the
  audio component of the Microsoft Windows 95 Game SDK that provides
  low-latency mixing, hardware acceleration, and direct access to the sound
  device. DirectSound provides this functionality while maintaining
  compatibility with existing Windows 95-based programs and device drivers.

8. Q. What do I do if I have problems with the DirectX drivers that replace my
  Windows 95 video and sound drivers?

  A. If you experience problems with the DirectX video or sound drivers, you can
  remove them by running Dxsetup.exe. Dxsetup.exe is supplied by the product
  that installed DirectX. For example, some games include DirectX support.

9. Q. Who supports Microsoft Game SDK and DirectX?

  A. Microsoft Game SDK is supported by Microsoft Developer Support. The DirectX
  drivers, such as video and sound drivers, are supported by the Desktop
  Systems group. If your DirectX drivers are provided by an original equipment
  manufacturer (OEM), the drivers are supported by that manufacturer.
