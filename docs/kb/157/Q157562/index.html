SUMMARY
=======

This article outlines how to combine two Personal Information Stores (PST).
These steps may be needed for disaster recovery by merging a backup copy of a
PST file or for convenience when moving to a new computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A PST is a file that contains messages, files, and other items stored in
folders. When you create a PST, you can store it on your computer's hard disk
drive or on a file server that you have access to. You can create any number of
PSTs and can save, copy, and move them around just like any other file.

The following example shows how to merge a PST file called Mailbox.pst with a
version from a backup also named Mailbox.pst. The scenario for this type of
restore could be that a new computer was brought online for a user and they
started using Microsoft Exchange with a default PST before obtaining their
original PST. In this example, the PSTs need to be combined with special
attention given to prevent overwriting the PSTs that have the same filename.

Steps to Merge Files:
---------------------

1. Make backup copies of both PST files.

2. Rename the restored version of Mailbox.pst to Mailbox1.pst.

3. Copy Mailbox1.pst to the directory that contains the working version of
  Mailbox.pst.

4. Add Mailbox1.pst to your active profile using steps 5 through 8.

5. From the Tools menu in the Viewer, click Options and then the Services tab.

6. In the The Following Information Services Are Set Up In This Profile dialog
  box, click Personal Information Store, and then click Add. In the The
  Following Information Services Are Set Up In This Profile box, click Personal
  Information Store, and then click Add.

7. In the Available Information Services box, click Mailbox1.pst and then click
  the OK.

8. Keep clicking the OK button until all open dialog boxes are closed.

You should now see two Personal Folders icons on the left pane of the Microsoft
Exchange client. The remaining steps outline how to move information from the
old PST (Mailbox1.pst) to the current PST (Mailbox.pst). When finished, you will
have your old mail merged with the current working file.

Merging the Duplicate Inbox, Sent Mail, and Deleted Items Folders
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Inbox, Sent Mail, and Deleted Items folders cannot be moved from one PST to
another. Instead, the items inside of each folder must be moved to the
destination PST. Folders that exist in both PSTs can be moved to the other PST
but the folders will be renamed. The following steps outline how to move the
contents of these folders without creating new folders with different names.
These steps are required when merging the Inbox, Sent Mail, and Deleted Items
folders.

Steps:
------

1. Expand the subfolders in both sets of Personal Folders if they are not
  currently visible on the left view.

2. Open the Inbox of Mailbox1.pst so the messages are visible on the right.
  Mailbox1.pst should be the second set of personal folders listed in the view
  pane since it was added last.

3. Click on a single message in the Inbox of Mailbox1.pst.

4. Select all messages by pressing CTRL-A or choose Select All from the Edit
  menu. All messages should be highlighted.

5. Click on the list of messages and drag and drop the contents of Inbox on top
  of the destination Inbox (Mailbox.pst).

6. Verify that the messages were copied into the current PST by opening the
  Inbox on Mailbox.pst.

7. Repeat these steps for Sent Mail and Deleted Items and for any folder that
  exists in both PSTs.

Merging Unique Folders
----------------------

If a folder does not exist in both PST files, you can simply drag and drop a
folder to move its contents. These steps may be useful when restoring from a
backup if the new PST hasn't had the same folder names created yet. If the
folder exists with the same name, see the steps above.

1. Expand the subfolders in both sets of Personal Folders if they are not
  currently visible on the left view.

2. Choose a folder in Mailbox1.pst that you want moved to Mailbox.pst by
  single-clicking on the folder.

3. Drag the folder to the destination PST file and drop it on top of Personal
  Folders. Your set of folders may be named something else. The top level of
  the PST file is the destination for the drag and drop.

4. Repeat steps for each unique folder.

Once you have completed these steps and have verified that the current PST is up
to date with all of your messages, you can remove the second PST from your
profile. The following steps outline this procedure. Note that the PST file is
not deleted from the disk during this procedure. The reference for the file is
only removed from the profile.

1. From the Tools menu in the Viewer, click Options, and then click the Services
  tab.

2. In The Following Information Services Are Set Up In This Profile box, click
  the second Personal Information Store, and then click the Delete button. If
  you need to confirm that this is the appropriate PST file, click Properties
  before Delete. In our example Mailbox1.pst should be the second PST.

3. Click the OK button until all open dialog boxes are closed. The PST is now
  removed from the active profile.

Note: For more information on moving and copying items and folders to the new
PST, see the Moving or Copying a Private Folder and Moving or Copying Items to
Other Folders topics in the Microsoft Exchange Help file.
