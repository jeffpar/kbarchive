-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to import bulletin board information from Lotus cc:Mail to
Microsoft Exchange Server, several error messages may be displayed and a public
folder may not be created, indicating that the import did not finish
successfully. If you view the application log, the following events appear:

  Source: MS Exchange Migration
  Event: 98
  Description: Parser Error on line &lt;x&gt;. An error occurred in processing
  of line #&lt;x&gt;.

  Source: MS Exchange Migration
  Event: 122
  Description: Parser Error on line &lt;x&gt;. Failure to open/create public
  Folder.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when the service account does not have permission to
create a top-level folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Microsoft Exchange, and then click
  Microsoft Exchange Administrator.

2. Click Configuration in the left pane, click Information Store Site
  Configuration in the right pane, and then click Properties on the File menu.
  Note that you may need to expand the server's branch in the left pane by
  double-clicking the branch, or by clicking the plus sign (+) to the left of
  the branch, before you can click Configuration.

3. Click the Top Level Folder Creation tab. If a list of names appears in the
  Allowed To Create Top Level Folders box, delete the names and then select
  All.

4. Click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There is no mailbox associated with the service account. Therefore, if you
specify a list of names in the Allowed To Create Top Level Folders box instead
of selecting All, you are unable to include the service account in the list and
the service account is unable to create top-level folders.

When you import bulletin board information from Lotus cc:Mail, Microsoft Exchange
Server creates a new public folder called Lotus cc:Mail Bulletin Boards
(&lt;server&gt;), where &lt;server&gt; is the name of the server from which you
are importing. The contents of the bulletin board are copied to this folder. If
you import multiple bulletin boards, additional folders for each bulletin board
are created below this folder.

cc:Mail is manufactured by Lotus, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
