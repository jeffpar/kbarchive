This article lists the graphics filters that are installed during a typical

MORE INFORMATION
================

Graphics Filters Installed During Typical Setup
-----------------------------------------------

The following graphic filters are installed during a typical Setup of either Word
97 or Office 97. These filters convert graphics on import with the exception of
the WordPerfect Graphics/DrawPerfect and CompuServe GIF converters. These two
converters are used by the WordPerfect and the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
text converters, respectively.


- Tagged Image File Format (TIFF)

- Encapsulated PostScript (EPS)

- WordPerfect Graphics/DrawPerfect (Imports WPG 1.0, 1.0e, and 2.0)

- WordPerfect Graphics (Export only)

- Macintosh PICT

- CompuServe GIF (import/export) used by the HTML converter.

Graphics Filters Not Installed During Typical Setup
---------------------------------------------------

The following graphics filters are not installed during a typical Setup. To
install these filters, rerun the Setup program, click Add/Remove, and then
select the graphics filter you want. Unless otherwise noted, these filters are
supported by Word for Windows only.

- Truevision Targa import (.tga)

- AutoCAD (.dxf)

- Micrografx Designer/Draw (.drw)

- CorelDraw (.cdr) versions 3.0, 4.0 5.0, 6.0

- Computer Graphics Metafile (.cgm)

- PC Paintbrush (.pcx)

- Kodak Photo-CD (.pcd) - Windows and Macintosh

Native (Built-in) Graphics Filters
----------------------------------

Word can directly import and store the following graphics formats:

- Windows Bitmap (.bmp, .dib, .rle)

- Windows Enhanced Metafile (.emf)

- Windows Metafile (.wmf) - Windows only

- JPEG File Interchange (.jpg)

- Portable Network Graphics (.png)

- Macintosh PICT - Macintosh only

Note that some of these filters can be installed during Setup. In this case the
filters are not used by Word, but by other Office applications, such as
PowerPoint and PhotoEditor.
