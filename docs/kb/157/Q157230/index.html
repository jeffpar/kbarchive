SYMPTOMS
========

When you are upgrading a computer to Windows NT 4.0, you may receive the
following error message:

  The procedure entry point NTDiskeeper could not be located in the dynamic
  link library Ntdll.dll.

This error can be generated by either the Dkfat.exe or Dkntfs.exe module, and can
occur even if the services are stopped before you begin the upgrade process.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you are upgrading a computer on which DisKeeper 1.1
by Executive Software is installed. DisKeeper 1.1 replaces the Windows NT kernel
with a modified version.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, uninstall DisKeeper 1.1 before you upgrade the
computer to Windows NT 4.0.

================

Executive Software has announced an updated version of DisKeeper that is
