SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Event Viewer located in Administrative Tools, the event viewer may
display different description information under Event Details for the same event
ID number. This problem occurs when either viewing an event log of a remote
computer or viewing a log file saved from a different computer locally.

CAUSE
=====

When an event is triggered in Windows NT, the event ID is written to the log
file, not the event description. Because of updated ERROR_CODEs and improvements
to Windows NT through service packs, the order and description codes have
changed.

When an event is triggered in Windows NT, the ID number of the event is written
to the log file to minimize the size of the log file, the text description
corresponding to the ID is not written to the log file but is looked up in a
.dll file when the event is opened. The .dll file that is used is dependent on
the event. As a result, when the event viewer is run, a lookup of the event ID
is referenced locally and the appropriate event ID text is displayed. This can
cause an event to have multiple meanings according to the versions of the system
and event log that is running.


RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid inconsistent error messages when reading the event log of a remote
computer, make sure all systems match according to version number and service
pack level. This can be verified by running WINMSD from within Windows NT and
selecting Version.
