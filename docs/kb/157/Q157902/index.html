-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If Microsoft Exchange is configured to use a sub address, it cannot communicate
with another Microsoft Exchange MTA or any other MTA through the French X.25
network (Transpac). When Exchange accepts an X.25 call, it sends back a Call
Accept packet with its own X.121 address.

CAUSE
=====

The CCITT X.25 1988 recommendations state that there are two formats for this
packet: Basic and Extended. If the Extended format is used, an Address block is
optional and Microsoft Exchange operates successfully. However, the French X.25
network uses the basic format. The problem occurs because the French X.25
network automatically adds the local DTE address. The only time that this
problem occurs is when you use a sub address.

Microsoft Exchange fails to communicate over X.25 in France. The Extended format
is only used if a specific complementary service is required. The Address block
is only used if Call Forwarding is active. Because this service is not requested
and the Address block is non-zero, the X.25 network clears the communication
with an error code of 4A, which translates into Longer of Address non zero.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server version 4.0.

A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Product
Support Services for more information.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The following components have been modified to handle special case for non-
standard French X.25 network.
