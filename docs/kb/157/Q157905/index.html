SUMMARY
=======

This article contains comments, corrections, and information on known errors
relating to the Microsoft Press book "Inside OLE, Second Edition."

The following topics are covered:

- CD-ROM: Visual C++ 4.x Update Files

MORE INFORMATION
================

CD-ROM:  Visual C++ 4.x Update Files
------------------------------------

"Inside OLE Second Edition," by Kraig Brockschmidt, was designed and tested for
use with Microsoft Visual C++ 2.0. Microsoft Visual C++ 4.0 will not compile
these samples unless specific changes are made.

The author, Kraig Brockschmidt, has prepared a set of updated makefiles to allow
most Inside OLE examples to compile using Visual C++ 4.x. The files are
contained in the INOLE2_4.EXE file.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  INOLE2_4.EXE
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/ole/Update/2.0/WIN98Me/EN-US/INOLE2_4.EXE)

README.TXT for vc4proj.EXE

Description:
  .MAK and .MDP files for use with Microsoft Visual C++ 4.x
  to compile the files provided with the Microsoft Press book
  titled, "Inside OLE Second Edition," by Kraig Brockschmidt

Readme created 8/5/96 by Microsoft Press
---------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
-------

These files will allow you to pull nearly all of the Inside OLE
samples into the VC++ 4.x IDE for compilation and debugging.  They do
not interfere or conflict with the command-line MAKEFILEs that are
already part of the samples.

UPDATE CONTENTS
---------------

INOLE2_4.exe- Contains the following files
  README.TXT-  Summary and installation instructions (this file)
  INSTALL.BAT- Batch file for default installation of vc4proj.exe
  vc4proj.exe- Contains all .MAK and .MDP files for
               "Inside OLE Second Edition"

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
-------------------------

1. Download INOLE2_4.exe.

2. Double-click (or run) INOLE2_4.exe in a temporary or cache
  directory to expand README.TXT (this file), install.bat, and
  vc4proj.exe.

3. Double-click INSTALL.BAT to perform the default installation of the
  "Inside OLE Second Edition" update files for VC++ 4.x.

  OR

  Move vc4proj.exe to the INOLE directory (c:\INOLE by default), and
  then run the following command from an MS-DOS command prompt:
       vc4proj.exe -d

4. Carefully read vc4proj.txt, which is placed in the INOLE directory
  by vc4proj.exe. vc4proj.txt contains important information
  regarding the use of the Inside OLE files with
  Microsoft Visual C++ version 4.

5. Delete README.TXT (this file), INSTALL.BAT, vc4proj.exe, and
  INOLE2_4.exe. (Note that INSTALL.BAT automatically attempts to
  clean up and delete these files.)

Microsoft Press does not guarantee that this update will work, nor does
Microsoft Press support the proper functioning of these update files.
