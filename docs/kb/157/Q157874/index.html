-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following are the minimum system requirements to successfully run Creative
Writer 2 from the compact disc:

- Computer: A multimedia PC or compatible with a 486/33 or higher
  microprocessor.

- Memory (RAM): 8 MB of RAM (16 MB recommended for best performance).

- Hard disk space: 16 MB of free disk space for minimum configuration, 22 MB
  for full configuration. The Web Publishing Wizard requires approximately 1MB
  of additional space. Also, additional hard disk space is required for
  creating documents.

- CD-ROM drive: 2X CD-ROM drive: This CD-ROM drive can transfer data from the
  CD-ROM at 300 KB per second while using less than 40 percent of the CPU
  bandwidth and has an average seek time of less than 400 milliseconds. MS-DOS
  CD-ROM Extensions (MSCDEX) version 2.2 or later.

- Video display requirements: Super VGA display capable of displaying 256
  colors at 640 x 480 resolution. Using more than 256 colors may affect
  performance. A local bus video card is recommended.

Operating system requirements: Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows NT,
version 4.0 or later.

- Sound requirements (optional): Windows-compatible 8-bit sound card capable of
  playing wave sound effects and MIDI music. Speakers or headphones.

- Internet requirements: To send e-mail packages, you need an e-mail account
  with an Internet service provider. You also need a separate e-mail program
  that supports file attachments.

  To post web pages, you need an Internet account that supports the posting of
  personal web pages. This means your account provider must provide space for
  you to copy files to a server that is accessible to the Internet. Contact
  your Internet service provider and ask whether your account supports the
  posting of personal web pages.

For more information on Internet requirements for e-mail and web publishing, see
the Readme.doc file on the CD-ROM.
