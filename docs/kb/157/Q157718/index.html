MORE INFORMATION
================

3.0  NEW FEATURES IN VISUAL SOURCESAFE 5.0
------------------------------------------

Microsoft Visual SourceSafe 5.0 adds many new features. Some of the highlights
include:

3.1 Archive Utility

The command-line utilities SSARC and SSRESTOR are the answers to the two most
important features missing from SourceSafe 4.

- How to get rid of old versions of my project (without destroying the whole
  project)

- How to move projects from one SourceSafe database to another (while
  preserving histories)?

Note that the archive utility requires administrator-level privileges to run. If
you do not give the "ADMIN" user a SourceSafe password, any user can run the
archive utility.

3.2 Visual Merge

When you merge a file (due to multiple checkouts, or after a branch), what if
there is a conflict: more than one user edited the same line of code? In Visual
SourceSafe 4.0, you had to edit a text file and look for greater- than and
less-than markers. In 5.0, the visual merge gives you point-and- click control
over the merging and conflict resolution process.

3.3 Project Diff

Click on a project, and then click "Difference." The dialog shows you the
differences between your current project in SourceSafe, and your working
directory: nothing new there. But inside the dialog, you can now Get, Check Out,
Check In, Add, Delete, and Diff files. In other words, project diff is now a
whole new interface, designed to give you a graphical way of reconciling
SourceSafe with your local directory.

3.4 "Edit" Command

You can now double-click on a file in the SourceSafe Explorer to edit that file
in your working directory instead of just viewing the file in SourceSafe.

3.5 Open Databases

Inside the SourceSafe Explorer, choose "Open SourceSafe Database" from the file
menu to change your view to another SourceSafe database.

3.6 Web Features

The new "Web" menu adds features specifically designed to help users who use
Visual SourceSafe to manage HTML and other Web files.

3.7 Exclusive Check Out

If you configure SourceSafe to allow multiple checkouts in the Admin program, a
user can still designate a particular checkout as "exclusive." An exclusive
checkout is represented by a red border around the icon in the SourceSafe
Explorer.

Note that when the administrator has disabled multiple checkouts, all checkouts
are exclusive.
