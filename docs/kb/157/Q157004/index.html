-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a text file on a Macintosh and attach it to a message that you
send from the Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client over the Microsoft Exchange
Internet Mail Connector (IMC), the file might contain extra characters at the
beginning of the file. This will occur when the IMC is set up to use MIME to
encode messages.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by the IMC converting these files to a MIME Content- Type
of Text/AppleFile instead of Application/AppleFile.

WORKAROUND
==========

- Strip the .TXT extension from the file before sending it.

- Run ResEdit against the .TXT file before sending it. This will add a Resource
  Fork and will be sent as a correct AppleDouble file.

- Always send to the recipient in RTF format. This sends all messages in a
  Application/MS-TNEF format which works fine if your sending to a system that
  understands this MIME type, usually another IMC.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange clients,
version 4.0, listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected
in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S. Service Pack 4. For information on
obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

  S E R V P A C K

MORE INFORMATION
================

The two major MIME types for Macintosh files are AppleSingle and AppleDouble.

When they are sent over the IMC, you should see the following:

- AppleSingle files are sent as Application/AppleFile

- AppleDouble files sent as Multipart/AppleDouble with two additional
  "sub-parts" of Application/AppleFile and Application/Octet-Stream (or another
  if the exact file type can be determined).
