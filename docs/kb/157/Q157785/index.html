SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to install the Microsoft Service for NetWare
Directory Services (MSNDS) using the Msbatch.inf file for batch installations of
Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft does not encourage or support changes to .inf files; therefore,
Microsoft Technical Support does not support the procedure in this article.
Although we have tested the following procedure and it appears to function as
described, make a backup copy of your .inf file before you proceed.

To install MSNDS using the Msbatch.inf file for batch installations of Windows
95, follow these steps:

1. Create a network installation of Windows 95.

2. Create a new folder on the same drive that contains the network installation
  of Windows 95 and then copy all the files for MSNDS to the new folder. The
  files for MSNDS are available as a downloadable file named Msnds.exe. For
  information about obtaining the Msnds.exe file, please see the following
  article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q138709 Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services Available

3. In the new folder, rename the Ndscli.inf file to Ndscli.old and then rename
  the Ndscli.sbs file to Ndscli.inf.

4. Use the Microsoft INF Installation Tool for Windows 95 (Infinst.exe) to
  integrate the contents of the Ndscli.inf file into the network installation
  of Windows 95.

  NOTE: The INF Installation Tool for Windows 95 is included in the CD-ROM
  version of Windows 95 and the Microsoft Windows 95 Resource Kit, but not in
  the floppy disk version of Windows 95. To use the INF Installation Tool for
  Windows 95, you must own the CD-ROM version of Windows 95 or the Microsoft
  Windows 95 Resource Kit.

5. Create an [Install] section in the Msbatch.inf file, if the section does not
  already exist, and then add the following line to the section:

  AddReg=NDSPP.ADD

6. Create an [NDSPP.ADD] section in the Msbatch.inf file, if the section does
  not already exist, and then add the following lines to the section.

  NOTE: Some of the following lines have been wrapped in this article. These
  lines should be entered as one continuous line in the Msbatch.inf file.

    HKLM,"System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Providers\Microsoft
       Print Provider for NetWare",Name,,"ndspp.dll"
    HKCR,CLSID\{E6EF27C0-7984-11CE-BA00-00AA001F3DC4},,,"Netware objects"
    HKCR,CLSID\{E6EF27C0-7984-11CE-BA00-00AA001F3DC4}\InProcServer32,,,
       "ndspp.dll"
    HKCR,CLSID\{E6EF27C0-7984-11CE-BA00-00AA001F3DC4}\InProcServer32,
       ThreadingModel,,"Apartment"
    HKCR,Printers\shellex\PropertySheetHandlers\CaptureConfig,,,
       "{971A71A0-449B-101B-A9B9-4AF3EEDDA3E3}"
    HKCR,CLSID\{971A71A0-449B-101B-A9B9-4AF3EEDDA3E3},,,"Capture
       Settings"
    HKCR,CLSID\{971A71A0-449B-101B-A9B9-4AF3EEDDA3E3}\InProcServer32,,,
       "ndspp.dll"
    HKCR,CLSID\{971A71A0-449B-101B-A9B9-4AF3EEDDA3E3}\InProcServer32,
       ThreadingModel,,"Apartment"

7. Create a [Network] section in the Msbatch.inf file, if the section does not
  already exist, and then add the following lines to the section:

  Clients=NWREDIR
  Services=NWREDIR4

8. If you want to set the preferred tree and default context in the Msbatch.inf
  file, create an [NWRedir4] section in the file, if the section does not
  already exist, and then add the following lines to the section:

  PreferredTree = &lt;tree&gt;
  NameContext = &lt;context&gt;

If you are attempting to create a shared installation of Windows 95 that uses
MSNDS from a network installation of Windows 95 located on a NetWare server, the
shared Windows folder should be located on a network server that is part of the
NDS tree you log on to. You must also set bindery emulation for the container in
which user accounts reside.

When you are using a shared installation of Windows 95 with a shared Windows
folder located on a NetWare server, Windows 95 uses a real-mode NetWare client
to connect to the NetWare server. If bindery emulation is not properly set, the
real-mode client is unable to connect to the NetWare server. When you log on to
the server using the real-mode client, you should use the user name and password
that you normally use to log on to the NDS tree. If you have not specified a
preferred tree and default context, the following error message may be displayed
when you attempt to log on:

  You are not logged into the NDS tree. Make sure your default context is set
  properly. To check the default context, click the network icon in Control
  Panel.
