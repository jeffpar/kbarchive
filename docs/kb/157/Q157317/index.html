-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An .fll or .dll file has been built with Microsoft Visual C++, version 4.2. The
.fll loads correctly on the development computer, but loading it on another
computer with Visual FoxPro or in a distributed .exe file causes the following
error message:

  Invalid Library File

CAUSE
=====

Beginning with Visual C++ 4.2, if an .fll or .dll file is compiled with the
Multithreaded dynamic-link library (DLL) (/MD) option, the Msvcrt.dll C run-
time library is needed for it to function properly. The Multithreaded DLL
compiler option is needed when building an .fll file using the FoxPro Library
Construction Kit.

RESOLUTION
==========

Obtain the Msvcrt.dll that is installed with Visual C++ 4.2 and place it in the
System (Windows 95) or System32 (Windows NT) subdirectory of the Windows
directory.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Msvcrt.dll is installed with Visual C++ 4.2 and is also shipped with Windows
NT 4.0 and the Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR 2). It is not included with
Visual FoxPro 3.0 or 5.0, Windows NT 3.x, or Windows 95 (including Service Pack
1).

Developers shipping .fll files created with Visual C++ 4.2 with their Visual
FoxPro applications need to include the Msvcrt.dll file in the source directory
with their .exe file when running the Visual FoxPro Setup Wizard. Then in step 6
of the Setup Wizard, specify that the Msvcrt.dll should be installed in the
WinSysDir.

Visual FoxPro includes other versions of the Visual C++ run-time libraries with
the Distribution Source files. They are Msvcrt20.dll, Msvcrt40.dll, and
Msvcrt10.dll (Visual FoxPro 3.0). The Setup Wizard automatically includes these
on the setup disks that it creates.

Note that these C runtime libraries, especially Msvcrt.dll, are needed even if
Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) are not used in the .fll or . dll file.
