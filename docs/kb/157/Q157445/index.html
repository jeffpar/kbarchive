-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you activate an SNA Server connection using a Distributed Link Service, the
connection may remain inactive and never activate. The following event will be
logged in the Windows NT Application Event Log where SNA Server is running:

  Event 77
  Source: SNA Server

  Connection &lt;connection name&gt; failed to activate due to failure at
  link service.

  Error Code = 0D0D

where 0D0D = Link Service not active on remote server

CAUSE
=====

The Distributed Link Service (SNAREMLS.DLL) was not allocating a buffer large
enough to read the list of link services from the registry, causing the end of
the link service data (for example, the service name) to be truncated. The error
occurs when the distributed link service tried to locate the link service on the
remote computer, and the service name was not found because the service name was
truncated.

To identify that this problem is occurring, the following entries will appear in
internal traces. On the computer running the Distributed Link Service (or
"SnaRem1", "SnaRem2", ...), internal SnaRem# traces will include the following:

  GRLSN  Remote Services = \\sna_central_gw\snadlc2
  GRLSN  Read service name "\\SNA_CENTRAL_GW\SNADLC2"
   :
   :
  reslc  Try link service 0 "\\SNA_CENTRAL_GW\SNADLC2?"
  reslc  Remote link service is \\SNA_CENTRAL_GW\SNADLC2?
  DFIND   Look in DOMAIN 0 SHR a040000
  DFIND  Open type = 0
  DFIND  Locate remote link service \\SNA_CENTRAL_GW\SNADLC2?

NOTE: The question mark (?) at the end of the link service name may be any
"garbage" character.

On the computer running the SNADLC2 (remote) link service, SnaBase internal
traces will include:

  SVCED  Searching for service SNADLC2?, type 11
  SVCED  Service SNADLC2?, type 11 not found

NOTE: The question mark (?) at the end of the link service name indicates that
while this server does support a link service called SNADLC2, it is not found.


RESOLUTION
==========

Add a semi-colon (;) character to the start and end of the Distributed Link
Service name(s) specified during SNA Server Setup of the Distributed Link
Service. For the example above, enter the following:

  Remote Link Services: [;\\sna_central_gw\snadlc2; ]

A hotfix for this problem is available from Microsoft.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version
2.11 Service Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA
Server 2.11 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):
