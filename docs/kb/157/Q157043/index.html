-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Mail that is sent over site connectors between two sites reroutes numerous
times, but then disappears without a delivery or a nondelivery report (NDR).

The following configuration produced this problem:

  Site1 (site1.test.com) &lt;-----SC-----&gt; Site2 (site2.test.com)

  Site1's Site connector address space includes SMTP* and X400. Site2's Site
  connector address space only includes X400 (and no SMTP address space is
  defined).

A message from site1, addressed to "&lt;username&gt;@site2.test.com" would be
expected to reroute 512 times, after which an NDR would be returned to the
originator.

CAUSE
=====

Decode failure occurs for a message after it has been rerouted multiple times.
An incorrect value was returned when read while processing the message.


WORKAROUND
==========

Properly configuring the Internet Mail Connector (IMC), when installed, to have
an address space for SMTP mail would avoid the rerouting and result in either
delivery or NDR, as appropriate. Alternatively, configuring a site connector
with an SMTP address space would achieve the same result.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version 4.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
