SUMMARY
=======

This article contains information about the Automation Manager and the
Connection Manager, such as the purpose of the Automation Manager, how to
properly register it, and how the Connection Manager handles client access
privileges.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Automation Manager runs in the background and basically does nothing more
than act as the process for handling remote automation. Specifically, the
Automation Manager serves as both an OLE Proxy and OLE Stub to process and
marshal remote procedural calls (RPCs). You are not able to create a remote
server object without having it running.

If you plan on making OLE Callbacks, then you need to have it running on the
client as well. If the Automation Manager is properly registered, then it is
automatically started when an OLE Callback is invoked (that is, an object
reference from the client is passed to the remote server).

If the Automation Manager does not automatically launch with an OLE Callback,
then it may not be registered properly. The Visual FoxPro installation process
does this automatically, but if the registry somehow becomes corrupt, you can do
this yourself from Visual FoxPro as follows:

  

     RUN /n c:\vfp\autmgr32.exe /regserver

Automation Manager registry settings are stored in the following location:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Automation Manager

The Remote Automation Connection Manager (RacMan) is a component that ships with
Visual FoxPro and handles the following:

- Remote connectivity on the client side--the client can change a server that
  is already registered locally to being registered remotely.
- Client access on the server side--the server can determine access for clients
  either at machine level or at automation server level. With NT, Access
  Control List (ACL) security policies can be enforced.

Registry settings for remote servers are stored with the specific server itself
in the CLSID key in HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT.
