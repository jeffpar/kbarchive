-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word 97, when you insert a picture or an object, by default, the
picture or object is inserted as floating object. That is, the Float Over Text
check box is always enabled.

In addition, if you click to clear the Float Over Text check box, the check box
is reset each time you insert a new picture or object. That is, the setting you
choose is not retained. You must clear the check box each time you insert an
object or picture.

This article provides a sample Visual Basic for Applications macro that opens the
InsertPicture or InsertObject dialog box with the Float Over Text check box
deselected.

Note: In Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 1, when you insert a picture or
object, it is inserted as an inline (non-floating) object. That is, the Float
Over Text check box is cleared by default.

In addition, if you click to select the Float Over Text check box, Word will
retain your setting. That is, the option will be set until you change it again.

For additional information, please see the following articles in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q170564 WD97: Pictures and Objects Inserted as Inline by Default in SR-1

WORKAROUND

support professionals can help explain the functionality of a particular
procedure, but they will not modify these examples to provide added
functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific needs. If you have

If you name the following example Visual Basic for Applications macros
"InsertPicture" and "InsertObject", Word will run these macros instead of
opening the default dialog box when you click From File (On the Insert Picture
menu) or when you click Object on the Insert menu. You can use another name and
assign the macro(s) to a toolbar button or menu if you want to have access both
to Word's built-in dialog box and the one displayed when these macros are run.

Macro workaround for the Insert Picture Dialog Box
--------------------------------------------------

     Sub InsertPicture()
        With Dialogs(wdDialogInsertPicture)
           .FloatOverText = False
           .Show
        End With
     End Sub

Macro workaround for the Insert Object Dialog Box
-------------------------------------------------

     Sub InsertObject()
        ' Turns the float over text option off.
        SendKeys "%{t}"
        ' Displays the Insert Object dialog.
        Dialogs(wdDialogInsertObject).Show
     End Sub

For more information about adding a command to a menu, click Contents And Index
on the Help menu, click the Index tab in Word Help, type the following text

  menus

and then double-click the selected text to go to the "Add a command or other item
to a menu" topic. If you are unable to find the information you need, ask the
Office Assistant.
