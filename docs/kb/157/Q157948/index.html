-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Exchange connectors (for example, the Internet Mail Connector [IMC]
and the AppleTalk message transfer agent [ATMTA]) change an incoming StuffIt
Delux attachment (that is, type=.sitd) to the more basic version of StuffIt
(that is, type=.sit!). This makes the file open incorrectly in the Microsoft
Exchange Macintosh client.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

1. Save the file to the hard disk drive.

2. Start StuffIt Delux.

3. Open the file.

-or-

NOTE: The following workaround is for the Microsoft Mail AppleTalk Connector
only.

1. On any computer running Microsoft Exchange Server and Windows NT Server with
  AppleTalk Connectors configured, look in

     &lt;exchsrvr&gt;\connect\msmcon\maildata\macgate\ini\mappings.txt

  for an entry for files with the .sit extension. It reads:

     .SIT=StuffIt file:SIT!:SIT!:Binary

2. Comment out this line, by inserting a number sign (#). This ensures that the
  file is sent in macbinary format.

  NOTE: This probably wasn't an issue with older versions of StuffIt where
  archives didn't contain a resource fork.

3. Stop and restart the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks and AppleTalk Connector
  services.

4. Send a test message with StuffIt Delux file from AppleTalk Mail to Microsoft
  Exchange Server. Use the Microsoft Exchange AppleTalk Mail Connector, and not
  SMTP, for this test.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
