SUMMARY
=======

When you run Microsoft Exchange on 16-bit Windows platforms (Windows 3.x Windows
for Workgroups 3.1x) you may receive unexplained "Out of Memory" and
"Insufficient Memory" error messages. In some circumstances, a utility called
"Memory Valet" can prevent these errors.

This utility is available from Microsoft and should only be used after normal
troubleshooting steps have failed. See the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
articles for initial client troubleshooting:

  Q151359 XCLN: Out of Memory Errors Starting Schedule+ After Exchange

  Q150156 XCLN: Cannot Send from Word When Exchange Client Not Running

  Q112676 Troubleshooting Insufficient Memory Errors

MORE INFORMATION
================

The utility Memory Valet 2.0 is included in Application Note WG1137. This
utility is available from Microsoft Product Support and can be mailed to
customers who continue to have problems with out of memory errors after
following the troubleshooting steps listed in the articles above.

This application note is not available through electronic services.


Memory Valet can help in situations in which there is not enough memory below
640K in the Windows system virtual machine to create a task database (TDB). In
such a situation, the following problems can occur:

- When you try to run an application, you receive the message "Out of memory.
  Close one or more applications and try again."

- An application calls WinExec to launch a component of itself and then fails.

- An OLE or dynamic data exchange (DDE) session fails to start the server
  application.

- When you try to run an application, you receive the message "Too many files
  open, please close one or more files," and increasing file handles does not
  correct the problem. (This is a rare occurrence and should only affect
  applications that require more than 20 open file handles.)

Memory Valet contains two components: the executable file (Memvalet.exe) and the
Control Panel utility (Memval.cpl). Memval.cpl lets you configure Memory Valet
and then displays the current state of the low-memory area. By using Memval.cpl,
you can determine how much low-memory space is available, the size of the
largest free block, and how many TDBs can fit in low memory given its current
state.
