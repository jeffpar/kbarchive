========================================================
A.  Hardware and System Requirements
========================================================

Requirements
========================================================
To play Football, you need:

* A 486/66 MHz computer or higher processor (Pentium 75 or
 higher recommended)
* Microsoft Windows 95
* A 2X CD-ROM drive or faster
* 8 MB of memory (RAM) (12+ MB recommended)
* 256-color Super VGA display with 1 MB VRAM; 2 MB recommended
* 20 MB of available hard disk space (60 MB recommended)
* A sound board plus speakers or headphones to hear audio
* A Microsoft Mouse or compatible pointing device; joystick or
 game pad recommended
* For modem play: a Hayes-compatible modem; 9600 baud minimum;
 14,400 or higher recommended
* For network play: a Windows-compatible network card

Note: Football requires Microsoft Windows 95. To purchase a Windows
upgrade, see your local retailer.

Enhancing Performance
========================================================
You can enhance the performance of single, tournament, and Multiplayer
games by doing any or all of the following:
* Close any open applications.
* Be sure that you are not logged on to a network unless you are
 playing a Multiplayer game.
* Change the game resolution to 640x480.
* Turn off or reduce the options in the Display and Sound dialog
 boxes.

See Q&amp;A in online Help for more information about improving
performance.

========================================================
B.  Installation and DirectX
========================================================

Installation
========================================================
A Minimal installation places some of the Microsoft Football components on
your hard disk. Choose this option if you want
to save disk space. A Optimal installation places all the Football
components on your hard disk.

To manually run setup, double-click on the Setup icon in your CD-ROM drive
to start installation.

Starting Football
========================================================
After installation Football will start up immediately. If you
choose to play the game later, you can start Football in two ways:
* Autorun enables the game to start as soon as you place the
 Football CD-ROM in the disc drive. Autorun may not work properly
 on some CD-ROM drivers. To work around this, click My Computer
 on your desktop, and double-click the icon for your C or D
 drive (your CD-ROM drive).
* Or click the Start button on the Windows taskbar, point to
 Programs, and then point to Microsoft Games and click
 Football.

As the game starts up you will see a video. You can hit any key
to bypass the video and go directly to the game.

DirectX
========================================================
Setup installs Football and DirectX drivers to your hard drive.
Football requires these drivers to run. If you install different
video drivers after installing Football, you may have problems
running Football.

If you don't already have DirectX installed, the hard drive space
required will be slightly more than the 60 MB Optimal (20 MB Minimum)
listed in setup.

If you have the beta release of DirectX 3, Football will not run. To
fix this, delete or rename the DirectX files in the ..\windows\system
folder and reinstall Football.

If you are using a 2x CD-ROM drive, you should do a Optimal installation
for better performance. This installation copies more files on to your hard
drive, improving the speed of the game.

DirectX and Localisation
========================================================
DirectX is not translated into languages other than English, so
all DirectX installation and error messages are in US English.

Game Controls
========================================================
Football is easiest to play with game pads such as the Microsoft
Sidewinder game pad or the Gravis Multiport Gamepad, but some
PCs are not automatically compatible with these devices yet.
You can setup game pads and joysticks through the Control Panel.
For example, to set up the Microsoft Sidewinder game pad:
    1. On the Windows 95 taskbar click Start, Settings,
       Control Panel.
    2. Double-click Gaming Devices.
    3. Select the Microsoft Sidewinder game pad from the list
       of devices.
    4. Select Settings and/or Test as needed.

Football can also be played with the keyboard and/or mouse. However,
when selecting your input device(s) from the User Controls screen,
you may want to choose the Customise button to specify keys and buttons
other than the defaults, which are listed in the booklet that comes with
your Football CD-ROM.

You can change game controls while you are setting up a single,
tournament, or Multiplayer game. However, you cannot change the
game controls during a game.

The Goodies Folder
========================================================
The "Goodies" folder on the Microsoft Football CD contains three
items: Internet Explorer 3.0, the Microsoft Games Demo, and the
Microsoft System Information Application. To get to these items,
point to the Start button, then to Programs, then to Windows
Explorer. Then navigate to the "Goodies" folder on your Football CD.

Internet Explorer 3.0
If you haven't installed Internet Explorer 3.0, you can install it
from the "IE 3.0 for Windows 95" folder. This folder contains the
following localised versions: English, Brazilian-Portuguese, French,
German, Italian, and Spanish. To install Internet Explorer,
double-click the appropriate icon in the folder.

Other localised versions of Internet Explorer 3.0 are available
at http://www.microsoft.com/ie/ on the Internet's World Wide Web.

Microsoft Games Demo
The Goodies folder contains the Gamedemo folder, which contains the
Microsoft Games Demo. The Games Demo includes promotions and, in some
cases, playable demos for other Microsoft games. To run the Games Demo,
just double-click on the gamesmpl.exe icon in the
Gamedemo folder.

Microsoft System Information Application
The Goodies folder also contains the Microsoft System Information
Application. This application is available to help you provide
information about your system configuration that could assist
Microsoft Product Support personnel in troubleshooting.

Conflicts with Intellipoint Software
========================================================
If you've installed Intellipoint Mouse software, it may interfere with
the functionality of Football. Specifically, if the ClickLock option on
the Productivity tab is on, and you play Football, two clicks are
required to do what one click ordinarily does.

========================================================
C.  Audio Troubleshooting
========================================================

If Football does not play sound properly, first verify that:
* You've correctly installed your Windows 95 sound drivers.
* Your speakers are on and turned up.
* The Windows 95 volume control is enabled and turned up.

If Football still doesn't play sound properly, verify that Windows
95 can play .wav files:
    1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click
       Control Panel.
    2. Double-click the Sounds icon.
    3. Under Events, click an event that has a loudspeaker icon
       next to it.
    4. In the Name text box, be sure that the three-letter file
       extension is ".wav".
    5. Under Preview, click the play button. You should hear a sound.

If you don't hear any sound, or if Windows 95 is not able to play a .wav
file, check to see that a sound driver is enabled:
    1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click
       Control Panel.
    2. Double-click the System icon.
    3. Click the Device Manager tab.
    4. Click the plus sign next to Sound, Video And Game Controllers.
    5. If there is no sound, video and game controllers entry, or
       you have no sound card listed under this entry, contact the
       manufacturer of the computer or sound card and request help
       for reinstalling the sound card drivers.

If you are able to play a .wav file in Windows 95, be sure that sounds
are enabled and recognised in Football:
    1. Start Football.
    2. On the Start Up screen, click Options, and then click Sound.
    3. Make sure that all the red sliders are at least halfway over,
       and Mute is turned off, and then click OK.
    4. To check whether Football will play a sound file, click any
       button on the Start Up screen.

========================================================
D.  Video Troubleshooting
========================================================

Displaying 256 Colours
========================================================
Your computer must display at least 256 colours to run Football.
If you don't have the necessary 256-color driver, or if you aren't sure
that your video card supports 256 colours, contact your video card
manufacturer.

DirectX Display Problems
========================================================
Football uses DirectX 2.0 technology. In some cases, the DirectX video
driver may not interact correctly with your video driver. If you experience
display problems, contact your video card manufacturer
for the latest DirectX 2.0 drivers. If you continue to experience problems
with DirectX 2.0 installed, try the following procedures:
    1. Restart your computer in safe mode by pressing F8 when you
       see the message "Starting Windows 95."
    2. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click
       Control Panel.
    3. Double-click the Display icon.
    4. Click the Settings tab.
    5. Click Change Display Type to display the Change Display Type
       dialog box.
    6. Under Adapter Type, click Change.
    7. In the Select Device dialog box, select the DirectX-compatible
       video driver suggested by your video card manufacturer. If you
       do not have a DirectX-compatible video driver, contact your
       video card manufacturer for an updated video driver.
    8. Restart your computer to apply the change you have made, and
       then start Football.
    9. Reinstall your video drivers. Note that Football will not run
       without DirectX drivers.

If you consistently cannot get a game started, DirectX may be having
problems with your video drivers. Contact your video card manufacturer
for updated DirectX drivers. See "Video Cards That Don't Support Football"
to see which video cards have problems with Football.

The Nexgen 586 system doesn't support DirectX, and therefore does not run
Football. More information may be available on the AMD World Wide Web site
at
http://www.amd.com/html/products/pcd/nx586/support/pscpuid.html.

Video Cards That Don't Support Football
========================================================
If you are using any of the following cards or processors, you
may experience problems when playing Football. If you experience
problems, please contact your hardware manufacturer for the latest DirectX
2.0 video drivers:

* Matrox Millenium video card: download Matrox's latest DirectX driver
 and latest video driver (version 3.14) from http://www.matrox.com/
* Boca SXVGA5-CLGD5424
* Trident 9440
* Diamond Stealth 64 Video 3400XL S3 Vision 868
* SDIS Weitek 9100
* Any video card using the Hornet Tender Pro video chip
* Some video cards using the Nvidia chip
* Matrox Impression causes display problems
* The ATI Mach 64 PCI video card ships with the ATI Graphics
 Xpression driver that will not run DirectDraw. Update this driver
 to the ATI Mach 64 PCI (macxw4) DirectDraw driver version 4.02
 from ATI Tech Enhanced.
* The Edge 3D PCI Video card and device driver that comes
 with the Nvidia NV1 chipset will not run DirectX. Update this driver
 to the Diamond Edge 3D PCI VGA Compatible Device Driver version 4.0
 from Diamond Multimedia Systems to run DirectX. The Diamond
 Multimedia Systems World Wide site is: http://www.diamondmm.com/
* The Orchid Technology Kelvin Video 64 PCI card with the Alliance Pro
 Motion 6410 chipset causes display problems. The DirectDraw driver
 has trouble changing resolutions when running Windows with a
 resolution of 1152x864x256 or higher. Change your Windows resolution
 to 1024x768 before running Football, and check the manufacturer for
 an updated DirectDraw driver.
* The Ark 2000 PV PCI Windows Accelerator has trouble with the cursor
 if the default Windows mode is not 256-color. The mouse display
 driver does not handle bit-depth changes properly, so the game
 switches the screen to 256-color mode. Change your default Windows
 mode to the 256-color mode.

========================================================
E.  Multiplayer Troubleshooting
========================================================

Network and modem games work best when you choose the Optimal installation
option during Football setup.

During a modem and network Multiplayer game, it may take the host's machine
(machine that sets up the game) a few minutes to set up the game and
download the information to the guest's machine (machine that joins the
game). If you have problems with modem games, reconfigure your modem as a
standard 28,800 baud or 14,400 baud modem instead of any modem-specific
configuration you may be using.

For the guest joining a modem or network game, when the Multiplayer
screen appears, the Team Editor button is enabled. The guest can make
changes with the players and teams, but these changes will not be
reflected in the current game, only in the next Multiplayer game they
host, or the next single or tournament game they play.

Modem Troubleshooting
========================================================

If you're having trouble playing a Multiplayer game over a modem,
there are a number of possible fixes:

Turn off flow control and error correction:
    1. On the Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Control
       Panel.
    2. Double-click Modems.
    3. Make sure your modem is highlighted, then click Properties,
       and then click the Connection tab.
    4. Click Advanced.
    5. Make sure the User Error Control and Use Flow Control
       checkboxes are deselected.

Make sure the FIFO buffers are on:
    1. On the Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Control
       Panel.
    2. Double-click Modems.
    3. In the Modem Properties dialog box, click Properties, and
       then the Connection tab.
    4. Click Port Settings.
    5. Make sure that the FIFO buffers checkbox is selected (default)

If you are hosting a game, try waiting for the message box that says
the connection is established before you click Play Game.

If you're setting up a Multiplayer modem game, and you click the Call
button, the Windows Dial dialog box appears. Try the following:
* Under the "Connect Using: TAPI Line:" try using different modem
 drivers.
* If you were hosting and not successfully connecting, call the same
 modem that was trying to connect to you. (Try this several times.)
 Sometimes modems will not connect one way, but will connect the
 other way.

If you're still having trouble with Multiplayer games over a
modem, try the following:
* Log out of Multiplayer, for both host and guest, and log in
 again.
* Quit Football and restart.
* Restart your computer and restart Football.

If there is more current information on modem problems, it will be
available on the Microsoft Football website:
http://www.microsoft.com/games/default.htm

NOTE: Changes made to modem settings in the Modem applet will affect
all modem sessions, and changes made to modem settings via the Windows
Dial dialog box affect only the current session.
