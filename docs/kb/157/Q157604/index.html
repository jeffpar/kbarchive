SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses troubleshooting problems you may encounter when playing
Golf 3.0 with other opponents over a network or modem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If ambient background sounds or other sounds stop during your multiplayer game,
choosing Help or running a flyby usually resets the sound. If not, you can save
the game, restart Golf, and resume the game.

During the setup of a multiplayer game, if you change your game selection after
bringing up the game specific screen (the third screen in the game setup) the
game may get confused about the scoring of the game. Restarting the multiplayer
game solves this.

If you have problems with modem games, reconfigure your modem as a standard
28,800 baud or 14,400 baud modem instead of any modem- specific configuration
you may be using.

When the start-up procedure for a multiplayer game is cancelled for any reason,
be sure that all message boxes that may have been displayed are closed before
the Host attempts to restart a game. If you are still having difficulty getting
connected to a multiplayer game, close Golf and Multiplayer, restart Golf and
then start a new game from Multiplayer.

It is recommended that all players in a multiplayer game have different names. It
may cause problems to have more than one player with the same name when saving
and playing saved games.

Closing and reopening the Connections dialog box cancels invitations and requests
to join that haven't been answered. After sending them, leave the Connections
dialog box open until all of them have been answered. You can click the main
Multiplayer screen to bring it forward without affecting outstanding invitations
or requests to visit.

If a host exits Multiplayer while you are accepting his or her invitation, you
may remain listed on your Available Games list as a guest of the host. To
correct this condition, close Golf and Multiplayer, and then restart Golf.

If your network has RAS access servers, you can play with people that are not on
your network:

1. Have the guest create a Dial-Up Networking connection to a RAS access server
  on your network.

2. Specify your network address to make a Multiplayer connection.

If you have the Microsoft Internet Explorer installed, and the Internet
AutoDialer is operating, it may interfere with Multiplayer connections. To turn
off the AutoDialer:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Internet icon.

3. On the AutoDial tab of the Internet Properties dialog box, click Use AutoDial
  so the check box is cleared.

To make a connection to someone who is on your network but can't be seen in the
list on the Players &amp; Places tab of the Connections dialog box, specify the
player's network address by clicking the Address Book button and clicking
Network.

Multiplayer may display multiple network addresses for your machine in the New
Network Address dialog box you can display from the Address Book. To connect
using the TCP/IP protocol, the person making the connection can specify either
the computer name or the specific TCP/IP address (a four-part number like
157.54.210.237). To connect using the IPX/SPX protocol, you must use the IPX/SPX
address (a two- part number/letter combination like 00006602:00AA00A70C17).

Multiplayer supports multiple network cards using the TCP/IP protocol. Use of
other protocols may result in Multiplayer connection problems. Use of Dial-Up
Networking counts as one network card. To disable a conflicting network
adapter:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. On the Device Manager tab, click Network Adapters, click the adapter you want
  to remove, and click Remove.

If you set the number of Chat messages to be saved to a high number (the default
is 20), you may experience several seconds of delay in the display of the main
Multiplayer screen.
