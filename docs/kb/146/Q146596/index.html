-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you open a message with an attachment using the Microsoft Exchange 16- bit
Windows client under Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups 3.x, the following
error will occur when you try to open the attachment:

  \\Servername\sharename\filename.ext does not exist

The same attachment can be opened by other users at different computers.

CAUSE
=====

This error will occur if the attachment in the message is linked to a file that
is on a share local to the user who sent the message. The redirector in Windows
3.1 and WFWG 3.x cannot use UNC pathnames to local shares.

For example, User1 is at a machine called USER1. A message is sent to User1 or
placed in a public folder that is linked to the file Test.txt, which is located
on \\USER1\Share. When User1 tries to open the attachment, the above error will
occur. However another user at a computer named USER2 will be able to open the
attachment.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem only occurs when sending linked attachments. Embedded attachments
do not point back to the shares from which they came. In the above example,
User1 would be able open the embedded attachment even though the file originated
on the USER1 share.

WORKAROUND
==========

Windows 95 and Windows NT workstations do not have the same redirector
limitation that Win 3.1 and WFWG 3.x have. So if a linked attachment is needed
by all members of the organization, using Windows 95 or Windows NT would be the
preferred method.
