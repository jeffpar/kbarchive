-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client fails to connect to Microsoft Exchange
Server if the client computer is running only the Windows 95 client for NetWare
Networks and the Microsoft Exchange Server-based computer is running Windows NT
File and Print Sharing for NetWare.

WORKAROUND
==========

It is possible to work around this problem by installing DCOM95, which provides
secure remote procedure calls (RPCs) by means of an updated Secur32.dll file.
DCOM95 is available from:

  http://www.microsoft.com/com/dcom/dcom1_2/dcom1_2.asp

If DCOM95 is installed, it is no longer necessary to install the Client for
Microsoft Networks to use the Microsoft Exchange Client with the Microsoft
Exchange Server service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client requires secure RPCs to communicate
with a Microsoft Exchange Server. The Client for NetWare Networks provided with
Windows 95 does not support secure RPC.

To establish a session to a Microsoft Exchange Server from a Microsoft Exchange
Windows 95 client, the Client for Microsoft Networks will also need to be
installed. In addition, the option to log on to Windows NT Domain as well as the
domain name need to be enabled in properties of the Client for Microsoft
Networks. This will in no way affect the performance of the Windows 95
networking services nor impair its ability to communicate with Windows NT FPNW
and/or Novell NetWare servers on the network.

The order in which the network clients load will not affect the Microsoft
Exchange Windows 95 client's ability to communicate with Microsoft Exchange
Server either.
