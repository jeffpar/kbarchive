-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Word may exhibit any of the following behaviors when the following conditions
are true:

- You have turned on Save Preview Picture for your document (on the File menu,
  click Properties and click the Summary tab).

  -and-

- Your document contains a PAGE field in the header or footer, and a PAGE field
  on any page other than the first page has a result of more digits than the
  first page number.

  For example, the first page PAGE field appears as a 1, and the tenth page PAGE
  field appears as a 10.

Examples of some behaviors that may occur include the following:

- Fields in the header or footer of a document appear incorrectly. Two fields
  may blend together. For example, a {Page} field and a {Title} field that are
  supposed to show this result:

  10Document Title

  show this or a similar result when field codes are turned off:

  1title

  and this or a similar result when field codes are turned on:

  {PageTitle}

  -or-

- The right field brace for the page field is missing. For example, the page
  field displays the following when field codes are turned on:

  {PAGE

  -or-

- The display results of a PAGE field include a vertical bar. For example, the
  page field displays the following when field codes are turned on:

  |10

  rather than 10.

  -or-

- Word stops responding (hangs) when you delete text in the header or footer.

  -or-

- You receive an invalid page fault (IPF) in module Winword.exe when saving the
  document as RTF.


CAUSE
=====

When the above conditions are true, Word incorrectly saves the field length
information, resulting in corrupted field codes.
