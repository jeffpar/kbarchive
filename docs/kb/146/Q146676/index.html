The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After including Microsoft Exchange Server in the Directory Synchronization
process of your Microsoft Mail environment, some Display Names are appended with
001. This behavior can be seen whether your Microsoft Exchange Server computer
is acting as the dirsync server or a dirsync requester.

CAUSE
=====

In any one given Microsoft Mail postoffice, all display names (friendly names)
must be unique. A Microsoft Mail postoffice may have multiple display names the
same in its Global Address List (GAL). For example:

  Bob SmithNET1/PO1/BSMITH
  Bob SmithNET2/PO2/BSMITH

The above would be perfectly acceptable in one Microsoft Mail postoffice, but the
following would not:

  Bob SmithNET1/PO1/BSMITH
  Bob SmithNET1/PO1/BSMITH2

In Microsoft Mail, neither Admin.exe nor Import.exe would allow the second Bob
Smith to be created.

Microsoft Exchange Server, on the other hand, will allow multiple objects to have
the same display name. Because of this, the Microsoft Exchange Directory
Synchronization Service (DXA) must ensure that it does not send the same display
name to any one Microsoft Mail postoffice.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, edit the registry as shown below and then follow
the rest of the procedure described below.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:

     \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeDX

3. Add the following case-sensitive DWORD value of 0:

     Unique Display Names

4. Quit Registry Editor.

After setting the registry parameter above, the following steps MUST be
performed.

1. Stop the Microsoft Exchange Directory Synchronization Service

2. Delete the contents of the DXADATA subdirectory. Do not delete the directory,
  only the contents of the directory.

3. Follow step a or step b below, depending on whether the DXA is acting as the
  dirsync server or the dirsync requester.

  a. If the DXA is acting as the dirsync server, using the Microsoft Exchange
     Admin utility, choose each Remote Requester object one by one and select
     the "Export on next cycle" check box on the General tab. This will force a
     full dirsync export to be sent to each Remote Requester.

  b. If the DXA is acting as a dirsync requester, using the Microsoft Exchange
     Administrator program, choose the dirsync requester object and select the
     "Export on next cycle" check box on the settings. This will force a full
     dirsync export to be sent to the dirsync server.

4. Start the Microsoft Exchange Directory Synchronization Service.

STATUS
======

version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S.
