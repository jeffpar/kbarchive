SUMMARY
=======

This article contains information about the components (add-ons) included with
Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1.

For information about obtaining Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1, please see

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following components are included with Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1:

Microsoft 32-Bit DLC Protocol for Windows 95
--------------------------------------------

The Data Link Control (DLC) protocol is used primarily to access IBM mainframe
and IBM AS/400 computers. The 32-bit DLC protocol software for Windows 95
enables a network administrator to add support for 32-bit and 16-bit DLC
programs. Host terminal-emulation programs use this protocol to communicate
directly with mainframe computers. The DLC protocol is not used for general
networking with Windows 95. For additional information about this component,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q139561 Availability of MSDLC32 and Support Boundaries

For information about the DLC update for the MSDLC32 protocol, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q148765 Availability of DLC Update for MSDLC32 Protocol

fixes and enables users running Microsoft Exchange with Windows 95 to access
their Microsoft Mail shared folders. (The Microsoft Mail information service
included with Windows 95 does not provide access to shared folders.) For more
information on this update, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q141127 SFS Post Office Shared Folders Not Available with MS Exchange

Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.0
-------------------------------

Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.0 makes browsing the Internet as easy as using
Windows 95, provides speed and functionality, and delivers compatibility with
today's standards while innovating for the future.

Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services
------------------------------------------------

The Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services and the Microsoft Client for
NetWare Networks provide full client support for NetWare Directory Services.

If you are a network administrator and your site uses NetWare version 4.0x and
4.1 servers, you should install this service to provide full Windows 95
networking support to your NetWare client users. For additional information
about this component, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q138709 Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services Available

Windows 95 Infrared Driver version 1.0
--------------------------------------

The Windows 95 Infrared driver enables you to use IrDA devices to connect to
peripheral devices or other Windows 95-based computers without using cables.

You should install the Windows 95 Infrared driver if your computer is equipped
with an infrared (IrDA-compatible) device that you want to use with Windows 95.
Windows 95 Service Pack 1 includes the Infrared Communications Driver version
1.0. Infrared Communications Driver version 2.0 is now available as a separate
download. For information on Infrared Communications Driver version 2.0, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q139445 Windows 95 Support for Infrared Data Association Connectivity

Windows 95 SLIP and Scripting Support for Dial-Up Networking
------------------------------------------------------------

Windows 95 Serial Line Internet Protocol (SLIP) support enables you to use
Dial-Up Networking to connect to any remote access server that uses the SLIP
standard. For more information about SLIP, see the Microsoft Windows 95 Resource
Kit.

Scripting support makes it possible for you to use scripts with Dial-Up
Networking. Many online service providers require you to enter information such
as your user name and password in order to establish a connection. With Dial-Up
Scripting, you can write a script to automate this process. For more information
about this component, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q135315 CD-ROM Extras for Microsoft Windows 95 Upgrade

Microsoft Word Viewer
---------------------

Microsoft Word Viewer version 7.1 enables you to view and print documents created
with Microsoft Word for Windows, even if you do not have Word for Windows. When
you display a document in Word Viewer, it appears exactly as it would in Word;
when you print a document, it looks just as if you had printed it from Word.
Although you cannot use Word Viewer to edit documents, you can copy information
from Word documents and activate OLE objects embedded within them. For
additional information about this component, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
