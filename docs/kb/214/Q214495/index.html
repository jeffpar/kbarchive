SYMPTOMS
========

During a zone transfer between a UNIX DNS server configured as a primary name
server and a Windows NT 4.0 DNS server configured as a secondary name server,
the following error messages may appear in the Event Viewer log:

  Event ID: 702
  Source: DNS
  Description: New version 126 of zone &lt;zone name&gt; found at dns server at
  &lt;TCP/IP address of primary DNS&gt; zone transfer is in progress.

  Event ID: 704
  Source: DNS
  Description: The zone &lt;zone name&gt; failed zone refresh check. Invalid
  response from DNS server at &lt;TCP/IP address of primary DNS&gt;. Check DNS
  server at &lt;TCP/IP address of primary DNS&gt; and ensure it is properly
  authoritative for this zone.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the zone file on the UNIX DNS server contains
non-RFC compliant characters. Some versions of UNIX permit the use of characters
that cannot be recognized by a Windows NT DNS name server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, perform the following steps:

1. Copy the zone file from the primary UNIX DNS server to the
  &lt;%Systemroot%&gt;\System32\DNS folder on a test computer running Windows
  NT that has the Windows NT DNS service installed.

2. Using the name of the zone file, create a primary zone. Click Start, point to
  Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click DNS Manager.

3. Right-click the TCP/IP address of the computer, click New Zone, click
  Primary, and then click Next.

4. Type the name of the zone file in the Zone name box, press TAB, click Next,
  and then click Finish.

5. If you cannot create the new primary zone, check the Event Viewer system log
  for error messages. The error message will identify the line number that is
  causing the failure and may look like:

  Event ID: 203
  Source: DNS
  Description: DNS Server could not parse database file &lt;file name&gt; line
  &lt;line number&gt;.

  Event ID: 245
  Source: DNS
  Description: DNS Server encountered name outside zone, in zone file &lt;file
  name&gt;, line &lt;line number&gt;.

  Each error will be followed by the following event ID

  Event ID: 150
  Source: DNS
  Description: DNS Server could not create domain &lt;domain name&gt;.

6. Using a text editor, correct or remove any non-RFC supported characters from
  the individual entries in the zone file using the line number noted above for
  reference. Repeat the zone creation process until no further errors are
  generated in the Event Viewer log.
