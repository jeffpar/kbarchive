The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Skipinv.exe is a utility shipped with the Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit that
runs on a Systems Management Server client to determine if taking of inventory
should be skipped. This utility might fail to recognize when the last inventory
was taken if that inventory occurred during a previous month but within the
timeframe specified. For example, if the last inventory was taken on 3/30/99 and
SKIPINV 10 is executed, inventory should not be taken until 4/9/99. But on
4/1/99, Skipinv.exe allows inventory to be taken because it incorrectly accounts
for the month change.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Systems Management Server service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.
