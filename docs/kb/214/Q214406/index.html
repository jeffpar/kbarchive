-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, versions 1.0, 1.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A CICS ABEND error message is recorded in the CICS log on the mainframe computer
when the COM Transaction Integrator (COMTI) method invoked is participating in a
Microsoft Transaction Server transaction using two phase commit and SNA Server
Sync Point Support (for IBM Sync Level 2). For example:

  "DFHAC2236 WNWCI51C Transaction TSQU abend ATCV in program LU62TSQU. Updates
  to local recoverable resources will be backed out."

In this example, DFHAC2236 is the IBM message number or ID and WNWCI51C is the
name of the CICS region.
This error can occur when you use a "CICS" remote environment (SNA Server version
4.0 and SNA Server version 4.0 Service Pack 1) or a "CICS Using LU6.2" remote
environment (SNA Server version 4.0 SP2).
The COMTI component library installed in the Microsoft Transaction Server package
would be marked as "Requires a transaction" or "Requires a new transaction".

CAUSE
=====

The CICS program may have been modeled after Synclevel2.txt, the two-phase
commit sample program provided with COMTI in the samples directory. This code
contains the following:

  ********************************************************
  ** CHECK THE EIB FIELDS TO DETERMINE WHAT ACTION COMTI
  ** HAS REQUESTED, THEN ISSUE EITHER A SYNCPOINT OR     
  ** ROLLBACK.
  ********************************************************
   NORMAL-TX-SYNCPOINT.
     IF EIBSYNC = X'FF'
       EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT END-EXEC
       EXEC CICS RECEIVE
         RESP(CMD-RESP)
         STATE(CONV-STATE)
         END-EXEC
     ELSE                                                         
       IF EIBSYNRB = X'FF'                                       
         EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT ROLLBACK END-EXEC                  
       ELSE                                                      
         EXEC CICS ABEND ABCODE('UNKN') END-EXEC                
       END-IF                                                    
     END-IF.

The EXEC CICS RECEIVE is inappropriate if the conversation is in a "free" state,
but is appropriate if the conversation is in a "receive" state.

WORKAROUND
==========

NOTE: This workaround may not address all the possible conversational states
that may occur, however, it does handle those encountered during testing at
Microsoft. Customers may find this solution is not comprehensive.
After the syncpoint command is issued (EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT), the conversation may
either be in a receive state (code: 88) or in a free state (code: 85). If it is
in a receive state , you should issue an EXEC CICS RECEIVE statement, as
follows, otherwise just terminate the program as in the product sample.
The following code would accomplish the task:

  *FIRST, DETERMINE THE CONVERSATION STATE.
   EXEC CICS EXTRACT ATTRIBUTES
     STATE (CONV-STATE)
     END-EXEC.

  *THEN, CONDITIONALLY, ISSUE THE RECEIVE.
   IF CONV-STATE = 88
     EXEC CICS RECEIVE
       RESP(CMD-RESP)
       STATE(CONV-STATE)
       END-EXEC
     END-IF.

Incidentally, similar logic would be appropriate after the EXEC CICS SYNCPOINT
ROLLBACK END-EXEC statement presented above as excerpted from the COMTI sample.
