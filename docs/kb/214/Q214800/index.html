SYMPTOMS
========

Chapter 3 of Microsoft Visual InterDev 6.0 Enterprise Developer's Workshop
includes sample code for a program called MenuDemo. This code is included in the
book and on the companion CD-ROM. However, the code references several files
that do not exist on the companion CD-ROM. These files are msmenu.js and
msmenu.css.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft Press has created a replacement self-extracting executable to resolve
this problem. Our replacement for the MenuDemo files does not require the
msmenu.js and msmenu.css files.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  Vi6edw1.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/vinterdev60pro/mspress/2.0/WIN98Me/EN-US/Vi6edw1.exe)
