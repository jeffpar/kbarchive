-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Web 3 Lotus cc:Mail source extractor will migrate Personal Mailing lists
during a migration, however, the resulting distribution lists (DLs) in the
personal address book (PAB) might not contain any recipients. You will also find
the following event 1052 in the application log.

  Event Id: 1052
  Source: MSExchangeMig
  Description:
  Unable to add 'Smith' to private Distribution List 'Everyone' for user Smith,
  John. The address could not be located in the cc:Mail post office.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is due to an unexpected format of the cc:Mail post office which
results in this bug. This may happen if the DL entries are stored in a
two-string format such as "Lastname, Firstname."

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: cc:Mail Source Extractor

+--------------------------+
| File name   | Version    | 
+--------------------------+
| Mlmig32.dll | 5.5.2543.1 | 
+--------------------------+


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

released as part of Web 3. Note that the cc:Mail source extractor is part of the
