SYMPTOMS
========

After performing a one-step migration using the latest Lotus cc:Mail source
extractor, the following error messages may be logged in the event viewer:

  Event: 8030
  Source: MsExchangeMig
  Description:
  PAB Section
  c:\florence.001\00000001.pri
  Line: 117
  Invalid number of fields in PAB Section Heading

  Event: 8124
  Source: MSExchangeMig
  Description:
  PAB Section
  c:\florence.001\00000001.pri
  Line: 119
  Bad section encountered. The remainder of this section will be skipped.

  Event 8002
  Source: MSExchangeMig
  Description:
  Errors occurred during the Migration Process. A recovery file has
  been created called c:\temp\00000001.pri

CAUSE
=====

These errors are due to a bug in the "Personal Mailing List" component in the
cc:Mail source extractor that was introduced for the Web 3 offering. A
subsequent fix and update of the cc:Mail source extractor will be added to the
Web site shortly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: cc:Mail Source Extractor

+-----------------------+
| File name   | Version | 
+-----------------------+
| Mlmig32.dll | 2543.1  | 
+-----------------------+

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

released as part of Web 3. Note that the cc:Mail source extractor is part of the
Exchange Migration Wizard program. To determine the version of the Exchange
Migration Wizard, follow these steps:

1. Start Windows Explorer.
