-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you display Project Differences in the Visual SourceSafe Explorer, certain
files are reported to be different, but the File Difference reports that the
files are identical.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, remove the "eol = n" setting from the user's Ss.ini
file. If you have this setting because some users are on the UNIX platform,
modify the Ss.ini file so that it contains the following:

  eol (PC) = rn
  eol (UNIX) = n

Note that if you remove or change the "eol = n" setting, you must remove the
local copy of the file affected and then Get Latest Version to see the correct
behavior.

A supported fix for Visual SourceSafe 6.0 that corrects this problem is now
available from Microsoft, but it has not been fully regression tested and should
be applied only to systems that experience this specific problem.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information on support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in a hotfix for Visual SourceSafe 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Add the line "eol = n" to your Ss.ini file. This file is located under the
  VSS\users\&lt;your login name&gt; subdirectory. If Visual SourceSafe is
  currently running, close it and then restart.

2. Create a new text file that contains line breaks.

3. Add the text file that you created to Visual SourceSafe, and then remove the
  local copy.

4. Select the Get on the Latest Version of the text file from the Visual
  SourceSafe Explorer to its working directory.

5. From the Visual SourceSafe Explorer, display the Project Differences.

  NOTE: The text file appears in red in the Differences window. This indicates
  that the local copy of the text file is different from the Visual SourceSafe
  copy.

6. Display the File Differences in Visual SourceSafe Explorer. Visual SourceSafe
  reports that the files are identical.
