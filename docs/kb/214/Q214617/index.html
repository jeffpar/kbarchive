SUMMARY
=======

Default printing in MFC supports changing the page orientation (Portrait or
Landscape) by interacting with the common Print dialog box. Sometimes, it may be
necessary to change the page orientation at run time without interacting with
the Print dialog box; for example, when changing the orientation to Landscape
for printing a large report.

Mfcdvmd.exe is a sample that shows how the page orientation can be changed
without interacting with the common Print dialog box. This is a self extracting
.exe file.

Sample Functionality
--------------------

First, the sample queries for the available printers, in the OnPrepareDC function
of CMyPrintView. Then, the sample allocates memory using the queried
PrinterInfo. This is done to query the name of the printer.

A member function ChangeDevMode() is added to CMyPrintView. The ChangeDevMode()
function follows these three steps for obtaining and changing the DEVMODE
buffer. The function takes a named printer and configures a DEVMODE to print in
Landscape if it supports these features. The resulting DEVMODE is returned to
the caller, that is the OnPrepareDC function. When OnPrepareDC is done with the
DEVMODE buffer, it is responsible for freeing the memory.

The change in the page orientation can be verified either by printing on paper or
by print-previewing. Even if the Print Setup dialog box is set to Portrait, the
page will print with a Landscape orientation.

NOTE: To use the Print APIs, Winspool.h needs to be included.
