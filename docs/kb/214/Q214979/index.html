  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server Service Manager may fail to connect to secondary site
servers, though connection to primary site servers is unimpeded. When you try to
connect to a secondary site server, you get a message stating:

  error communicating with the specified site and server

Because of this problem, you cannot control services of secondary sites nor
modify the logging on features using Service Manager from the primary site
server.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To enable logging on services for a secondary site, use the remote management
ability of Regedt32.exe:

1. Click Run on the Start menu and type Regedit.

2. Under the Registry menu, click Connect Network Registry.

3. Type the name of the secondary site server in the Computer name text field.

4. Once connected to the secondary server, expand Hkey_Local_Machine, then in
  turn expand Software, Microsoft, SMS, and Tracing.

5. Click the component for which you want to enable logging on.

6. In the right window pane, click Enabled and change the value to 1.

7. Click OK to save the changed value.

  NOTE: To change the log file size, modify the MaxFileSize value in the right
  window pane.

Whether the component for which you just enabled logging on is a child thread of
a service or a service of its own, you must stop and restart that service for
the logging on to take effect.

STATUS
======

version 2.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 2.0. For information on obtaining the service
