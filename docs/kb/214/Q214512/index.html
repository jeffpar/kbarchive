- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Services for UNIX Add-On Pack 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a directory that has been shared as an NFS mount from a Windows NT Services
for Unix NFS server is moved (copied to another location on the server), it
appears to be automatically unshared, because NFS clients can no longer mount
the share. However, it is not unshared automatically. NFS clients can no longer
mount the share but, until the server is rebooted, the share will continue to be
displayed as an available NFS mount when a client views the exports list of the
server.

Also, because the directory is not actually unshared, if it is moved back to its
original location, it again becomes available for clients to mount.


CAUSE
=====

The exports list for the NFS server service is not updated when the directory is
moved because the directory does not actually get unshared.

NOTE: Sharing attributes on the directory are not actually removed. If the
directory is returned to its original location, it again becomes accessible
provided that the server was not restarted. If the server was restarted,
returning the directory to its original location and restarting the server will
again make the directory mountable.

RESOLUTION
==========

Directories shared through NFS should not to be moved because of the
parent/child sharing limitation within NFS.

Unshare the directory before moving it, and then reshare it if you want.
