Extensions on a UNIX operating system.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To uninstall the Server Extensions, follow the steps below (Note: you will need
log in as root):

1. Type the following:

  "cd /usr/local/frontpage/version3.0/bin" (without the quotation marks)

2. In the bin directory is an executable file called Fpsrvadm.exe. Run the
  executable by typing the following:

  "./fpsrvadm.exe" (without the quotation marks)

3. When you see the list of 15 options to choose from, choose option 3 to
  uninstall.

4. The default in the brackets is number [1]. Select option 3 and press the
  Enter key.

5. The next step asks for the port number. The default port is [80] unless you
  have installed it to a different port. Press the Enter key. If you have
  installed it to a different port, type in the port number and then press the
  Enter key.

6. When it informs you that Port 80: uninstall is complete, you will be returned
  to the bin directory.

To install the Server Extensions, perform the following steps (Note: you will
need to be logged in as root):

1. Type the following:

  "cd /usr/local/frontpage/version3.0/bin" (without the quotation marks)

2. In the bin directory is an executable file called Fpsrvadm.exe. Run the
  executable by typing the following:

  "./fpsrvadm.exe" (without the quotation marks)

3. When see the list of 15 options to choose from, choose option 1 to install.

4. The default in the brackets is number [1]. Press the Enter key.

5. The next set of choices is for the type of Web server. Locate the number that
  corresponds to your Web server, type in the number, and then press the Enter
  key.

6. The next prompt is for the server config file name. You will need to know
  where this file is located. The file is Httpd.conf. You will need to type in
  the entire path, for example /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf.

  If you are not sure, type the following command:

  "find / -name httpd.conf -print" (without the quotation marks)

7. The next prompt requests for the host name. Unless your are multihosting your
  Web server or have a virtual server, press the Enter key.

  If you are multihosting or have a virtual server, type in either the IP
  address or the Host Name, and then press the Enter key.

8. The next prompt ask for the user name. This is typically going to be the
  owner of the Web. Type in the user's name and press the Enter key. (This will
  be used in FrontPage when prompted for a user's name.)

9. The next prompt ask for a password. Type in whatever password you want to
  assign the Web owner. (This will be used when you are prompted in FrontPage
  for a password.)

10. Retype the password to confirm it, and then press the Enter key. The install
  in now complete.

All other versions of UNIX - 11

GID

HPUX - 20
IRIX - 20
SUNOS4 - 20
SCO - 24

The above restrictions apply only to the Apache Web server, with the Microsoft
FrontPage patch compiled into it.
