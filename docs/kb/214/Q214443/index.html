SUMMARY
=======

This article describes what happens in the background when a client disk is
created and then run on a computer running Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows
Millennium Edition (Me), or Windows NT Workstation 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Creating the Client Disk
------------------------

The Setup Computer Wizard is used to create the client disk. During this process,
a script that will tell the client computer to get application and configuration
information from the server is created. The name of the script is Netparam.ini.
The script is based on a Response File. The Response File is a standardized
script that Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server uses to build the setup
disk.

Netparam.ini, along with the Setup program, is saved to a disk. This compiled
script cannot be saved on the server nor can it be run across the network.

Using the Client Disk
---------------------

After the client disk is created, the client disk is taken to the client computer
and the Setup program runs on the client computer. The Setup program does
several things, including checking to see if there is a network adapter
installed on the computer. If a network card is detected and TCP/IP is present,
the network settings are configured. These settings are the machine name, the
workgroup name, the sharing level, and the TCP/IP settings for obtaining an IP
address from a DHCP server.

The machine is restarted when the network settings are put into place. The Setup
program then installs each specified application. Shortcuts to the user's own
shared folder and to the Company Shared Folders directory are created on the
client desktop. Internet Explorer is set up to start with the Client Online
Guide as the home page.

The client installation process generates the user's logon script and stores it
on the SBS server in the Netlogon share. This script can be modified later, if
needed.
