-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe 6.0c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Show Differences option in the Visual SourceSafe 6.0c graphical
user interface (GUI), the command that checks differences does not ignore
end-of-line characters in each file. As a result, files are marked as different,
even if the only difference in each file is the end-of-line character.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.
