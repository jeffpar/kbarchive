SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article explains how to run a process under another identity
other than the SYSTEM account.

Default Installation
--------------------

By default, on a computer that is running Windows NT 4.0 Server, or on a Windows
NT 4.0 computer that has Internet Information Server 4.0 installed, Web sites
are set to run in-process or under the SYSTEM account. You can set a Web site or
virtual directory and its associated applications to run in separate memory
space and, therefore, run under the IWAM_machine account.

By default, on computers that run the following, Web sites are set to run in
medium pooled or under the IWAM_machine account:

- Windows 2000 Server
- Windows 2000 Professional with Internet Information Services 5.0
- Windows XP Professional with Internet Information Services 5.1

You can set a Web site or virtual directory and its associated applications to
run in either of the following ways:

- Medium pooled or high isolation and, therefore, run under the IWAM_machine
  account.

- Low (IIS Process) and, therefore, run under the SYSTEM account.

Security Context
----------------

Processes are always executed in the context of an account. For example,
Inetinfo.exe runs as a process that is launched by the SYSTEM account,
therefore, Inetinfo.exe runs in the context of the SYSTEM account.

The SYSTEM account is not a typical user account: it does not have network
access, therefore, applications that are running as SYSTEM cannot access network
resources. For additional information about security context, click the article
number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q248187 HOWTO: Impersonate a User from Active Server Pages

NOTE: It is possible to run the IIS services (Inetinfo.exe) to run as a specified
user account, however, that is an unsupported configuration.

For the application to access resources from a remote server, you can configure
your Web site or application to run out-of-process and configure that process to
run under a domain user account (by default, it is run under the IWAM_machine
account context). Therefore, you can assign the appropriate NTFS file system
permissions for that domain account to the remote server.

Configure and Run Out-of-Process
--------------------------------

To configure an application to run out-of-process and then set that process to
run under the identify of another account, follow the appropriate steps for your
system:

Internet Information Services 5.0 and 5.1:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, select Administrative Tools, and then click
  Internet Services Manager.

2. Expand the &lt;Server Name&gt;.

3. Select and right-click the Web site that you want, and then click Properties.

4. On the Home Directory tab, see the Application Protection drop-down list. By
  default, this is Medium (Pooled). Select Medium (Pooled), or select High if
  you want.
  NOTE: You can select Low(IIS Process) if you want to run it under the SYSTEM
  account.

5. Click Apply.

6. Close all the Properties dialog boxes, and then close Internet Services
  Manager.

7. Open the Component Services console:
  Click Start, point to Programs , point to Administrative Tools, and then click
  Component Services.

8. Expand the Component Service, expand Computers, expand My Computer, and then
  expand COM+ Applications folders.

9. Locate the corresponding COM+ application that you have set to run in Medium
  or High Application Protection earlier for the Web application (for example,
  IIS-default Web site//Root/AppName), right-click that COM+ application, and
  then click Properties.

10. On the Identity tab, click This user.

11. Locate or type the domain\user ID and password that has the appropriate
  domain access to your network resource, and then click OK.

Internet Information Services 4.0:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, select Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack, point to
  Microsoft Internet Information Services, and then click Internet Services
  Manager.
  NOTE: Do not click HTML.

2. Expand the &lt;Server Name&gt;.

3. Select and right-click the Web site that you want, and then click Properties.

4. On the Home Directory tab, see a check box for you to set Run in separate
  memory space (isolated process). By default, this is cleared (not checked).

5. Click Apply.

6. Close all the Properties dialog boxes, and then close Internet Services
  Manager.

7. Click Start, point to Programs, click Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack, point to
  Microsoft Transaction Server, and then click Transaction Server Explorer.

8. Expand the Microsoft Transaction Server, expand Computers, expand My
  Computer, and then expand Packages Installed folders.

9. Locate the corresponding MTS package for your Web application that you have
  set to Run in separate memory space earlier in these steps (for example,
  IIS-default Web site//Root/AppName), right-click the MTS package, and then
  click Properties.

10. On the Identity tab, click This user, locate or type the domain\user ID and
  password that has the appropriate domain access to your network resource,
  and then click OK.

11. Stop and start IIS Services.
