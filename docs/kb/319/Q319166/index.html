SUMMARY
=======

Standard Sender can create a maximum of five sender threads for communications
to all sites and a maximum of three sender threads for communications to the
same site by default. These default settings can lead to a backlog of scheduled
job files in certain environments.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To configure the sender thread count:

1. Start the SMS Administrator console.

2. Expand Site Settings, and then expand Senders.

3. Right-click the sender component you want to configure, and then click
  Properties.

4. Click the Advanced tab, and then configure the appropriate settings in the
  Maximum Concurrent Sendings section.

If you reset the sender thread count, consider the following issues:

- If the sites are connected by high speed links, the jobs are sent by the
  sender component quickly. If you increase the number of sender threads, you
  increase the network traffic that is generated by the site server.

- If you increase the number of sender threads, the load on the site server is
  also increased. You may need to try a particular setting over time to find
  the optimum setting for a particular site.

- A site that only communicates with its parent site does not need as many
  sender threads as a primary site that has many child sites. If you increase
  the number of threads, site server performance may not be affected.

If you enable logging at a site for the sender component, review Sender.log. If
you see that all available sender threads are being used, no additional sender
threads will be created. If there are a sufficient number of jobs that are to be
sent to other sites, a backlog may be created until the existing sender threads
can process the jobs. If all available sender threads are being used often, the
backlog may grow and may cause a negative impact to the site, for example, you
may have a backlog of files that are waiting to be processed.

The maximum number of sender threads that you can configure for a site is 999 for
all sites and 999 for each site. It is recommended that you increase the sender
threads a small number at a time until you achieve the optimum thread count.
Closely monitor site server performance when you increase the sender threads so
that you can adjust the thread count if the site is negatively impacted.
