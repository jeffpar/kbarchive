-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send mail to your Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 computer from an Active
Server Pages (ASP) page that uses Collaboration Data Objects for Windows NT
Server (CDONTS), you may receive the following error message:

  80070003 "Path not found error"

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, make sure that the Exchange Server Internet Mail Service
is installed and working correctly on your computer. Next, verify that the
registry settings for Exchange Server are correct. After you verify that the
registry settings are correct, you may want to reinstall Internet Explorer 4.01,
and then modify the Internet Information Service (IIS) metafile.

NOTE: Internet Explorer 4.01 is required for the Windows NT Option Pack that
installs IIS. It adds needed components to IIS. Reinstall Internet Explorer 4.01
to make sure that all required objects are available in IIS.

Verify that the Internet Mail Service Is Installed
--------------------------------------------------

To verify that the Internet Mail Service is installed and is working properly,
follow these steps:

1. Click Start, click Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. In Control Panel, double-click Services.

3. In the list of Services, locate Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Service, and
  then make sure that Status is listed as Started. If nothing appears in the
  Status column for the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Service, click Start
  to start Internet Mail Service.

4. Click Close.

Verify Exchange Server Registry Settings
----------------------------------------

To verify the correct Exchange Server registry settings, follow these steps:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "regedt32" (without the quotation marks), and then
  click OK.

3. In the Registry Editor, locate the following subkey:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Exchange\Active Messaging\Use Exchange

4. Make sure that this entry is set to a value of "1" (without the quotation
  marks).

5. In the Registry Editor, locate the following subkey:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Exchange\Active Messaging

6. On the Security menu, click Permissions.

7. Select Everyone in the Name list in the Registry Key Permissions dialog box,
  and then click Full Control in the "Type of Access" list.

8. Click OK.

9. In the Registry Editor, locate the following subkey:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters\RootDir

10. Double-click the RootDir value, note the path that appears in the String
  text box, and then append this value by typing "\pickup" (without the
  quotation marks) at the end of the path.

11. Click OK.

12. Open Windows Explorer, and then locate the path that you edited in step 10.

13. Make sure that a folder named "Pickup" is located in this path. If no Pickup
  folder exists, click File, click New, and then click Folder. Type "Pickup"
  (without the quotation marks) for the folder name, and then press ENTER.

14. Right-click the folder, and then select Properties.

15. In the Properties dialog box, click Security, and then click Permissions.

16. In the Directory Permissions dialog box, Everyone must be listed as having
  Full Control. If Everyone does not appear, click Add, and then click
  Everyone in the list of names. In the "Type of Access" drop-down list, click
  Full Control, and then click OK.

17. In the Directory Permissions dialog box, click to select the Replace
  Permissions on Subdirectories check box, click OK, and then click Yes in the
  confirmation dialog box.

18. Click OK.

19. Close Windows Explorer.

20. In the Registry Editor, locate the following subkey in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters

21. On the Security menu, click Permissions.

22. In the Registry Key Permissions dialog box, click Everyone in the Name list,
  and then in the "Type of Access" list, click Full Control.

23. Click OK.

Reinstall Internet Explorer 4.01 or Later
-----------------------------------------

1. Run Setup for Internet Explorer 4.01 or later.

2. Follow the on-screen instructions.

3. Restart your computer when Setup is complete.

Use Mdutil to Modify the MetaFile
---------------------------------

Optionally, you can modify the metafile when you use the Mdutil.exe utility that
is included in the Windows NT Option Pack.

To use Mdutil.exe, follow these steps:

1. Copy the Mdutil.exe file from either the Windows NT Option Pack CD-ROM or the
  Windows 2000 CD-ROM to your System32 folder.

2. Click Start, and then click Run.

3. In the Run dialog box, type "cmd" (without the quotation marks), and then
  press ENTER.

4. In the Command window, type the following command

  mdutil set SmtpSvc/1 -prop 36880 -dtype STRING -value
  "&lt;drive&gt;:\exchsrvr\imcdata\Pickup" -s gozer

where &lt;drive&gt;:\exchsrvr\imcdata\Pickup is the full path to the Pickup
directory for your Exchange Server. NOTE: If you need help using the Mdutil.exe
utility, type "mdutil" (without the quotation marks) in the Command window.
5. Close the Command window.
