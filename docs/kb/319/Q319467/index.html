-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 Professional Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article lists the known documentation errors in Flight Simulator 2002 Help.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Aircraft &amp; Engines Menu
-----------------------

The Engines dialog box Help topic incorrectly states that you can go to the
"Aircraft &amp; Engines" menu to start your engines.

You can start your engines, but the "Aircraft &amp; Engines" menu does not exist
in Flight Simulator 2002.

Crashes and Damage
------------------

The Changing Realism Settings Help topic incorrectly states that you can select
"Off-Runway crash realism", "Can collide with dynamic scenery" and "Manual
lights control" options.

These options do not exist in Flight Simulator 2002.

Flight Analysis Dialog Box
--------------------------

In the Flight Analysis feature, a Help topic incorrectly states the following:

  Using the Flight Analysis feature, you can get immediate feedback on your
  maneuvers, landings, or unsuccessful flights. Use the Flight Analysis dialog
  box to specify the type of analysis, and the options and settings that you
  want.

Flight Simulator 2002 does not provide the Flight Analysis dialog box. Flight
Simulator 2002 instead provides basic latitude, longitude, altitude, heading,
and airspeed indicators, a view similar to mapview, and an altitude graph of
your flight.

Modem Use
---------

The Multiplayer/Joining games topic in Help contains an incorrect section on
joining a session over a modem connection.

Flight Simulator 2002 does not support multiplayer games by means of direct modem
connection. As an alternative, play multiplayer sessions on the Internet through
the MSN Gaming Zone. To do this, follow these steps.

NOTE: Because there are several versions of Windows, the following steps may be
different on your computer. If they are, please consult your product
documentation to complete these steps.

1. Start your Web browser, and then visit the following MSN Web site:

  http://zone.msn.com/blog.asp?TAd=1

2. Insert your Flight Simulator 2002 CD-ROM.

3. Click Flight Simulator 2002.

4. Follow the onscreen instructions to join a game.

Printing Checklist Files
------------------------

The In Game Checklist incorrectly states the following:

  NOTE: This aircraft's real-world checklists have been modified for use with
  Flight Simulator 2002. To learn about using, printing, and customizing
  checklists, see Help.

Although "checklist" is listed in the glossary, Help does not provide information
about checklists or how to print them.

print navigation charts, click the article numbers below to view the articles in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q312605 Flight Simulator 2002: You Cannot Find the Navigation Charts

VPEDIT
------

The Help topic for Flight Dynamic Editor in the Aircraft Editor incorrectly
states the following:

  ...the advanced VPEDIT voice pack feature included with Flight Simulator 2002
  Professional Edition.

VPEDIT is not included with Flight Simulator 2002 Professional Edition.
