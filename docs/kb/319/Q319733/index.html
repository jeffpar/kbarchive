NOTE: These patches do not include fixes for vulnerabilities involving non-IIS
products, such as the Front Page Server Extensions and Index Server, even though
these products are closely associated with IIS and are typically installed on
IIS servers. There is, however, one exception. The fix for the vulnerability
that affects Index Server, which is discussed in Microsoft Security Bulletin
MS01-033 (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-033.asp), is
included in this patch because of the seriousness of the issue for IIS servers.
At the time that this article was written, the Microsoft Security Bulletins that
discuss these vulnerabilities are as follows:

  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS01-043
  (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-043.asp)

  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS01-025
  (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms01-025.asp)

  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-084
  (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms00-084.asp)

  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-018
  (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms00-018.asp) (which
  discusses the same issue as Microsoft Security Bulletin MS02-018)
  (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/security/bulletin/ms02-018.asp)

  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-006
  (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms00-006.asp)

All of the previously listed fixes and cumulative patches are included in Windows
2000 Service Pack 3. For additional information about the latest service pack
for Windows 2000, click the article number below to view the article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q260910 How to Obtain the Latest Windows 2000 Service Pack

NOTE: The fixes for the following vulnerabilities that affect IIS 4.0 are not
included in the patch because they require administrative action instead of a
software change. Administrators should make sure that in addition to applying
this patch, they also take the administrative action that is described in the
following bulletins:

  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-028
  (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms00-028.asp)

  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-025
  (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms00-025.asp)

  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-025
  (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms99-025.asp) (which
  discusses the same issue as Microsoft Security Bulletin MS98-004)
  (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms98-004.asp)

  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS99-013
  (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms99-013.asp)

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft scanned this file for viruses. Microsoft used the most current
virus-detection software that was available on the date that the file was
posted. The file is stored on secure servers that prevent any unauthorized
changes to the file.

You do not have to restart your computer after you apply this update. The
installer stops and restarts the IIS service automatically. If you are prompted
to restart your computer, ignore the prompt.

The Q319733 package supports the following switches:

  -x   Extract the files for later installation
  -u   Unattended mode
  -f   Force other programs to close when the computer shuts down   
  -n   Do not back up files for uninstall
  -o   Overwrite OEM files without prompting
  -z   Do not restart when installation is complete
  -q   Quiet mode (no user interaction)
  -l   List installed hotfixes

The English version of this fix has the file attributes (or later) that are
listed in the following table. The dates and times for these files are listed in
coordinated universal time (UTC). When you view the file information, it is
converted to local time. To find the difference between UTC and local time, use

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft scanned this file for viruses. Microsoft used the most current
virus-detection software that was available on the date that the file was
posted. The file is stored on secure servers that prevent any unauthorized
changes to the file.

After you apply this update, space characters such as white space, tabs, carriage
returns, and line feeds in the IIS log file are replaced with plus signs (+). If
you have a log analyzer that parses the IIS log file, you may have to update it
to accommodate this change. To work around this problem while you update your
log analyzer, extract the patch with the "-x" switch and do not install the
Iislog.dll file.

You do not have to restart your computer after you apply this update, because the
installer stops and restarts the IIS service automatically.

The Q319733 package supports the following switches:

  -x Extract the files for later installation
  -y Perform uninstall (only with /m or /q)
  -f Force apps closed at shutdown
  -n Do not create uninstall directory
  -z Do not reboot when update completes
  -q Quiet Mode -- no user interface
  -m Unattended mode
  -l List installed hotfixes

changes to the file.

Perform the following steps to avoid the need to restart your computer:

NOTE: Although you can avoid the need to restart your computer after applying
this patch, the computer will NOT be considered patched and protected until
after a restart. Unlike in Windows 2000 (IIS 5), in Windows NT 4.0 (IIS 4) the
older .dll files are not automatically updated. The steps to avoid a restart
should only be taken if you want to apply more than one patch before you restart
the computer, and should always be followed by a restart.

1. Stop all IIS services.

2. Install the patch with the hotfix with "/z" switch.

3. Restart the IIS services.

The Q319733 package supports the following switches:

  -x Extract the files for later installation
  -y Perform uninstall (only with /m or /q)
  -f Force apps closed at shutdown
  -n Do not create uninstall directory
  -z Do not reboot when update completes
  -q Quiet Mode -- no user interface
