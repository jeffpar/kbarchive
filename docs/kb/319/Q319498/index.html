The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server version 4.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to start the Small Business Server (SBS) console in Microsoft
BackOffice Small Business Server 4.5, you may receive the following error
message:

  Unable to register or start the Saminfo1 control pack. Please make sure all
  support packs are properly installed and registered.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may occur if some components of the SBS console are damaged.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, reinstall the SBS console. The console reinstall option
is designed to restore the functionality of Small Business Server by verifying
and updating the necessary components and default settings. To reinstall the SBS
console, follow these steps:

1. Perform a backup of all files in the &lt;drive&gt;:\SmallBusiness folder,
  where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive on which Windows is installed.

2. Start Windows Explorer, browse to the &lt;drive&gt;:\SmallBusiness folder,
  and then delete all files in the folder. Click Yes when you are prompted to
  confirm the file deletion.

3. Insert CD3 of the Small Business Server CD-ROM package into your computer's
  CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive.

4. Click Start, and then click Run.

5. In the Open box, type "cmd" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.

6. Type the following lines at the command prompt, pressing ENTER after each
  line, where &lt;CD-ROM drive&gt; is the drive of your computer's CD-ROM or
  DVD-ROM drive that contains Small Business Server CD3:

  &lt;CD-ROM drive&gt;:
  sbsadmin\i386\sbssetup.exe /reinstall

NOTE: After you reinstall the console and restart your computer, you must
re-create the Administrator profile. The Administrator profile must be present
for the Microsoft Fax Service to send fax notifications.
