-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++.NET (2002) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The COleVariant constructor, COleVariant(long lSrc, VARTYPE vtSrc = VT_I4), does
not correctly initialize its members. As a result, when you call the
CDaoTableDef::CreateField member function, you receive a CDaoException exception
with the following call stack:

  

  KERNEL32.DLL!RaiseException
  msvcr70.dll!_CxxThrowException
  DaoBug.exe!AfxThrowDaoException
  DaoBug.exe!AfxDaoCheck
  DaoBug.exe!CDaoTableDef::CreateField

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the constructor initializes members based on an
uninitialized member. As a result, the vt member of COleVariant may be
initialized to the VT_UI4 or the VT_HRESULT variant type instead of the VT_I4
variant type.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Visual Studio .NET service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services

support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.
