The two programs shown below demonstrate how a Microsoft C routine can
pass a char to BASIC.

This information about interlanguage calling applies to QuickBASIC
Versions 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50 for MS-DOS, to Microsoft BASIC Compiler
Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS and MS OS/2, and to Microsoft BASIC
Professional Development System (PDS) Version 7.00 for MS-DOS and MS
OS/2.

For more information about passing other types of parameters between
BASIC and C, and a list of which BASIC and C versions are compatible
with each other, query in the Software/Data Library for the following
word:

   BAS2C

Code Example
------------

The following BASIC program is BSUB.BAS, which invokes a C routine
that passes a char to a BASIC subroutine, which then prints out the
received character (and its length):

DECLARE SUB CSUB CDECL()
TYPE char                  ' must declare user-defined TYPE to hold
   character AS STRING *1  '  char, as there are no single-byte
END TYPE                   '  TYPEs in BASIC
CALL CSUB
END

SUB BASSUB(cchar AS char) ' subroutine called by C routine
   PRINT cchar.character
   PRINT LEN(cchar.character)
END SUB

The following program is CSUB.C, which passes a char to a BASIC
subroutine:

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
struct character         /* must declare as struct so type casting */
       {                 /* won't affect value */
          char thechar;
       };
extern void pascal bassub(struct character *baschar);
struct character *c_char;

void csub()
{
   c_char-&gt;thechar = 'A';
   bassub(c_char);

}

To demonstrate these programs from an .EXE program, compile and link
as follows:

   BC BSUB.BAS;
   CL /c /AM CSUB.C;
   LINK /NOE BSUB CSUB;

BSUB.EXE produces the following output:

   A
