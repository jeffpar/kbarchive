Question:

When I compile my program, the compiler gives me an error message that
says "Cannot edit binary files" or "Cannot load binary file." My
source file loads correctly, so why do I get this error message when I
compile it?

Response:

These error messages indicate that either one of the include files is
bad, or you have a bad file on the program list. To correct this
error, you must identify the bad file and replace it.

If You Are Using QuickC Version 1.00 or 1.01
--------------------------------------------

1. Locate the bad file. After you press ENTER at the error message,
   QuickC will do one of the following two things:

   a. Return you to the source window and report "no errors." This
      indicates that the bad file is one of the include files. To
      determine which include file is bad, remove them from your
      source file, one at a time, until the error goes away.

   b. Continue to compile and link the program, then return to the
      source window reporting "error L1101: invalid object module"
      This indicates that the bad file is one of the files in the
      program list. To determine which file is bad, remove the files
      from the program list, one at a time, until the error goes away.

2. If the file was originally from one of the distribution disks,
   replace it with a fresh copy from your backup copy of the
   distribution disk.

If You Are Using QuickC Version 2.00 or 2.01
--------------------------------------------

1. Locate the bad file. After you press ENTER at the error message,
   QuickC will do one of the following two things:

   a. Return you to the source window and display "error C2059: syntax
      error 'int constant'." This indicates that the bad file is one
      of the include files. The error message will report the name of
      the bad file.

   b. Return you to the source window and display "error C2018:
      unknown character '0x...'." This indicates that the bad file is
      one of the files on the program list. The error message will
      report the name of the bad file.

2. If the file is originally from one of the distribution disks,
   replace it with a fresh copy from your backup copy of the
   distribution disks.
