When given a filename that is more than eight characters, the file
system under MS-DOS truncates the filename to eight characters.
Because of this, the following include statement

   #include &lt;gefildefish.h&gt;

looks for the following header file to resolve the reference:

   gefildef.h

As long as the file gefildef.h is found on the disk, no error or
warning message is displayed.

Under OS/2 Version 1.10, however, the file system does not truncate
names, but filenames with more than eight characters are not used.
Therefore, the following fatal error message appears when specifying
an include file with more than characters:

   C1015: cannot open include file '&lt;filename&gt;'

This problem also occurs in QuickC Versions 1.01, 2.00, 2.01 and
QuickAssembler Version 2.01.
