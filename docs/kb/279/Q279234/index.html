The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure a Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) database with a
case-sensitive sort order on a Microsoft Windows 2000-based server, problems may
occur when you attempt to assign security rights. When a new security instance
is created in the SMS Administrator console, the user account that created this
instance is given the appropriate class right permissions. However, the account
is also added with an initial capital letter, and is set to "No Permissions."

Example
-------

Log on as domain\administrator, and then create a new collection. When you review
the security rights for the collection after you successfully create it, you see
the following information:

  Domain\administrator - Full Access (Read, Modify, Delete, Create, Administer,
  etc)
  Domain\Administrator - No Permissions

After you quit and then restart the SMS Administrator console, only the
collection that was previously created is displayed, while none of the SMS
default collections are listed.

In addition, when you add a new user through the Security Rights node of the SMS
Administrator console, regardless of which rights you copy, a new user receives
the following rights:

  Collections - No Permissions
  Packages - No Permissions
  Advertisements - No security context added

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q288239 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack




WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, perform the necessary SQL procedures to change the
sort order so that it is not case sensitive.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4.
