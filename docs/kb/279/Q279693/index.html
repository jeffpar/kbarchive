SUMMARY
=======

InstallShield provides a Visual Basic Setup Wizard that scans Visual Basic
applications for dependencies and creates a setup. Sometimes, a component may
call another component in such a way that the wizard cannot determine the
dependency. In addition, components that are added after the wizard is run may
not be included in the setup.

Some of the common errors that occur from applications that are installed with
missing components are:

  Error 429 ActiveX Component Can't Create Object

  -or-

  Unable to bind to field or data member "name of field"

  -or-

  Error loading DLL.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: Microsoft does not support the creation of Visual Basic setup programs
with InstallShield. For more information, refer to the following Microsoft
Knowledge Base article:

  Q167053 INFO: InstallShield Not Supported by Microsoft Tech Support

Use the following steps to troubleshoot your installation:

1. Create a Package and Deployment Wizard (Visual Basic 6.0) or Setup Wizard
  (Visual Basic 5.0) setup.

2. Install the setup that you create in step 1 on the target computer.

3. If the problem is resolved after you install the application, continue with
  step 4. If the problem is not resolved, check the Microsoft Knowledge Base
  for more information regarding the error.

4. If you create the setup with the Package and Deployment Wizard, you should
  have a Support Files folder that is located in the same folder as your
  package. The files in the folder are required in order for your Visual Basic
  application to run. Compare these files with the files in your InstallShield
  setup to determine what is missing.
