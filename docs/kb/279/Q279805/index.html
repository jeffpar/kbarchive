-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you request a read receipt for a message that you sent to a Novell GroupWise
recipient, the read receipt may indicate that the message was read seven hours
later than it was actually read. For example, if the message was read at 4:00
P.M., the read receipt may indicate that the message was read at 11:00 P.M. This
problem may occur even though all of the e-mail clients and servers that are
involved are located in the same time zone and are set to the same system time.

WORKAROUND
==========

Because the time that is displayed in the read receipt is seven hours later than
the correct time, rather than earlier than the correct time, the time that is
displayed is usually later than the current time when you receive the read
receipt. This makes it relatively easy to determine if the problem that this
article describes is occurring, because the time that is displayed in the read
receipt cannot possibly be correct. If you determine that you are experiencing
this problem, you can work around this problem and calculate the correct time by
subtracting seven hours from the time that is displayed in the read receipt.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
