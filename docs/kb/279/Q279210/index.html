2. In the Named box, type "Combatfs.cfg" (without the quotation marks).

3. In the "Look in" box, click My Computer, and then click Find Now.

4. In the list of found files, double-click the Combatfs.cfg file.

5. If you are prompted to select the program you want to use to open the file,
  click Notepad in the "Choose the program you want to use" box, and then click
  OK.

6. Scroll to the end of the file, press ENTER twice, and then type the following
  lines, pressing ENTER after you type each line:

  [SOUND]
  Channels=1
  SamplesPerSec=11025

7. On the File menu, click Exit.

  When you are prompted to save the changes, click Yes.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Obtain and Install Updated Device Drivers
-----------------------------------------

Contact the manufacturer of your game controller to inquire about how to obtain
and install the latest version of the driver for your game controller.

In addition, if your game controller is connected to the game port in your sound
card, contact the manufacturer of your sound card to inquire about how to obtain
and install the latest version of the sound driver for your sound card.

For information about how to contact the manufacturers of your game controller
and sound card, click the appropriate article number in the following list to
view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q65416 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, A-K

  Q60781 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, L-P

  Q60782 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, Q-Z

To determine the manufacturer and model of your sound card:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. Click the Device Manager tab.

4. Click the plus sign (+) next to "Sound, video and game controllers" to expand
  the branch.

5. Note the manufacturer and model of the sound card that is listed in the
  "Sound, video and game controllers" branch, and then click OK.

6. Close Control Panel.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Configure the Sound Card to Use Only One DMA Channel
----------------------------------------------------

Your game controller may perform better if you configure the sound card to use
only one DMA channel.

NOTE: Some programs are unable to run with only one DMA channel. If you
experience this issue, restore your original sound card settings.

To configure a legacy sound driver on a Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows
Me-based computer to use single-mode DMA, or to configure a native sound driver
on a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0-based computer to use single-mode DMA:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Multimedia.

3. On the Devices or Advanced tab, click the plus sign (+) next to Audio Devices
  to expand the branch.

4. Click the sound card, and then click Properties.

5. Click Settings.

6. To configure the sound card to use single-mode DMA, refer to your sound card
  documentation, or use one of the following procedures:

   - Click to select the Use Single-Mode DMA check box, click OK until you
     return to Control Panel, and then restart the computer.

   - In the DMA Channel (16-bit) box, click Disable, click OK until you return
     to Control Panel, and then restart the computer.

   - In the High DMA box, click Use DMA, click OK until you return to Control
     Panel, and then restart the computer.

  If you cannot use the sound card driver to configure single-mode DMA, click
  Cancel until you return to Control Panel, and then proceed to the "Disable
  Force-Feedback Effects" method in this article.

To configure a native sound driver on a Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows
Me-based computer to use single-mode DMA:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. Click the Device Manager tab.

4. Click the plus sign (+) next to "Sound, video and game controllers" to expand
  the branch.

5. Click the sound card, and then click Properties.

6. Click the Resources tab.

7. Under Resource Type, locate the Direct Memory Access (DMA) lines. If you see
  more than one Direct Memory Access (DMA) line, configure the sound card for
  single-mode DMA. To do this:

  a. Click to clear the Use Automatic Settings check box.

  b. In the Settings Based On box, click a Basic Configuration that uses only
     one DMA channel setting.

     If you see a conflict message in the Conflicting Device List box, repeat
     this step to select another basic configuration that uses only one DMA
     channel and does not conflict with any other devices.

     If you do not see a conflict message in the Conflicting Device List box,
     click OK, and then click Yes.

  c. Click Close, and then restart the computer.

  If you see only one Direct Memory Access (DMA) line, or if you cannot find a
  basic configuration that uses only one DMA channel, click Cancel, click
  Cancel again, and then proceed to the next method.

Disable Force-Feedback Effects
------------------------------

If you use a SideWinder Force Feedback Pro joystick or SideWinder Force Feedback
Wheel, disable the force-feedback effects. To do this:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Game Controllers.

3. Click to select Microsoft SideWinder Force Feedback Pro or Microsoft
  SideWinder Force Feedback Wheel.

4. Click Properties.

5. On the Settings tab, drag the Force Feedback slider to the Off position.

6. Click OK, and then click OK again.
