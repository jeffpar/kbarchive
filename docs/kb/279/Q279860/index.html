SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to configure the Microsoft Exchange Server Internet
Mail Service to stop relaying junk e-mail (spam). This procedure does not
prevent Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) clients and Internet Message
Access Protocol 4 (IMAP4) clients from sending SMTP messages.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To configure the Microsoft Exchange Server Internet Mail Service to stop
relaying unwanted mail, follow the instructions in the following Microsoft
Knowledge Base article:

  Q196626 XFOR: Restricting Routing in the Internet Mail Service

This article describes how to enable specific Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or
users to relay SMTP messages by using the Routing Restrictions tab. When you
follow the procedure in this article, you may inadvertently configure the
Internet Mail Service so that POP3 and IMAP4 users are prevented from sending
messages to the Internet.

If all POP3 and IMAP4 users connect from the same IP addresses or IP subnets,
click to select the "Hosts and clients with these IP addresses" check box on the
Routing Restrictions tab. If you add the respective IP addresses or subnets, the
clients are able to send Internet messages.

If you click to select the "Hosts and clients that authenticate" check box, you
must configure clients that connect to this service to send Internet messages.
Each client profile must be set up to log on to the outgoing mail server.

To enable outgoing server authentication in Microsoft Outlook Express, follow
these steps:

1. Open the properties of the default Internet account, and then click the
  Servers tab.

2. In the Incoming Mail Server box, verify that the user account information is
  in this format: &lt;domain&gt;\&lt;accountname&gt;. This information should
  be followed by the domain account password.

3. In the Outgoing Mail Server box, click to select the "My server requires
  authentication" check box, and then click the Settings button.

4. Click either the "Use same settings as my incoming mail server" check box, or
  specify an additional account and password to use that is different from the
  incoming mail server's account and password.

5. Click OK to save the settings.

POP3 and IMAP4 users are now able to send Internet messages, and the security
settings to prevent junk e-mail remain intact.
