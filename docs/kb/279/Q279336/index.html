SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a security vulnerability in
Windows NT 4.0. This vulnerability could allow a malicious user to run a special
program to disable an affected computer's network functionality.

Like all other objects under Windows NT 4.0, mutexes (synchronization objects
that govern access to resources) have permissions associated with them that
govern how they can be accessed. However, a particular mutex that is used to
govern access to a networking resource has inappropriately loose permissions.
This could enable an attacker who has the ability to run code on a local
computer to monopolize the mutex, thereby preventing any other processes from
using the resource that it controls. This would have the effect of preventing
the computer from participating on the network.

The attacker would require interactive logon access to the affected computer.
This significantly limits the scope of the vulnerability because, if normal
security recommendations have been followed, unprivileged users are not granted
interactive logon rights to critical computers such as servers. Unprivileged
users typically are granted interactive logon rights to workstations and
Terminal Servers. However, a workstation would not be a tempting target for an
attacker, because the attacker could use this vulnerability to deny service only
to himself or herself. The computers most likely to be affected would be
Terminal Servers.
