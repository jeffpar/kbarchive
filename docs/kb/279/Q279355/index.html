IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Host Integration Server (HIS) 2000, the User Credential
Database, which is located under the Security Integration option, may not be
displayed as an installable feature.

CAUSE
=====

If HIS 2000 and Microsoft Database Engine (MSDE) (which is required for Host
Security) were previously installed, but later both products were removed, the
next time you re-install HIS 2000, the User Credential Database is not listed as
a feature to install. Because this feature is not listed, the Setup program
assumes that MSDE was already installed on this system, when in fact, it was
not.

During the process of removing MSDE, the MS_HI_Server_DB registry key was not
deleted.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this problem:

1. Delete the MS_HI_Server_DB registry key, which is located as follows:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MicrosoftSQLServer\MS_HI_Server_DB

2. Re-run the HIS 2000 installation.

The User Credential Database now should be listed as an installable feature.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
