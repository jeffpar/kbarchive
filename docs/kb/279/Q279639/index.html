-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows 2000 Server Resource Kit documentation for APPSEC.EXE states that to
allow users to run 16-bit applications, you will need to add NTVDM.EXE to the
authorized lists of applications. However, attempting to add NTVDM.EXE to the
Authorized Application list, using the Add Authorized Application dialog box,
will not add NTVDM.EXE to the list.

CAUSE
=====

It is not possible to add NTVDM.EXE to the list using the Add Authorized
Application dialog box.

WORKAROUND
==========

To allow users to run a 16-bit applications, add the 16-bit application to
AppSec. This will automatically add NTVDM.EXE as well as other files that are
required to run a 16-bit application (e.g. WOW).

To verify that NTVDM.EXE has been added, exit the AppSec utility and then
re-launch it.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following information in the Resource Kit documentation for APPSEC.EXE is
incorrect.

"The Application Security tool can only be used to restrict 32-bit applications.
By default when AppSec is enabled users are restricted from running any 16-bit
applications. To allow users to run all 16-bit applications, the administrator
can add ntvdm.exe to the authorized list of applications."

Note: This documentation is included in both the Windows 2000 Server Resource Kit
and the Windows 2000 Professional Resource Kit. However, the AppSec tool is
included in the Windows 2000 Server Resource Kit only, and is not included in
the Windows 2000 Professional Resource Kit.
