SYMPTOMS
========

When an administrator adds additional Systems Network Architecture (SNA) host
print sessions to an SNA Server or Host Integration Server (HIS) 2000
configuration, users who are connected to 3270 sessions may get disconnected
when the SNA/HIS 2000 configuration is saved. Additionally, users may not be
able to reconnect to their 3270 sessions after the configuration change is
made.

This behavior only occurs if the 3270 printer Logical Units (LUs) that are used
by the SNA/HIS 2000 Print Server and host print sessions are also assigned to
specific users or groups in the SNA Manager.

CAUSE
=====

When a user starts a 3270 emulator, a request is sent to a SNA/HIS 2000 Server
prompting for a list of the 3270 LUs/Pools assigned to the user. If the response
to this request contains more 3270 LUs/Pools then the 3270 emulator supports,
the emulator may not connect to the SNA/HIS 2000 server. It has been observed
that users may be disconnected from active 3270 sessions when this behavior
occurs also.


RESOLUTION
==========

If the 3270 printer LUs that is being used by the SNA/HIS 2000 host print
sessions is assigned to users or groups in the SNA Manager, remove the LU
assignments and save the SNA configuration.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Do not assign 3270 print LUs that are being used by the SNA/HIS 2000 Print
Server host print sessions to users or groups as they operate under the context
of the SNA/HIS 2000 print service (Snaprint.exe).

A behavior with similar symptoms can occur if large numbers of 3270 LUs/Pools are
assigned to specific users or groups in the SNA Manager even if the SNA/HIS 2000
print service is not being used. The SNA Manager allows a maximum of 4000 3270
LUs/Pools to be assigned to each configured user or group. If a 3270 emulator or
other SNA application that uses 3270 LUs has a limit to the number of LUs/Pools
that it can accept from the SNA/HIS 2000 Server, then this behavior can occur if
the application limit is exceeded.
