-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to send e-mail messages through Exchange Server 5.5, your
messages may not be delivered. Additionally, you may not receive mail as
expected. In the list of services under Computer Management (click Start, point
to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click Computer Management),
it appears that Internet Mail Service is not running. When you attempt to
manually start Internet Mail Service, the service does not start and the
following events are displayed in the Event Viewer:

  Event ID: 4018
  Type: Error
  Source: MSExchangeIMC
  Description: Unable to start the Internet Mail Connector service because MAPI
  could not be initialized.

-and-

  Event ID: 4116
  Type: Error
  Source: MSExchangeIMC
  Description: An error was returned from the messaging software, the Internet
  Mail Service uses, to process messages on the Microsoft Exchange Server. It
  is possible that the piece of mail being processed at the time will not be
  delivered. The message that was being processed has been moved to the "BAD"
  folder. Use the appropriate utilities found in the SUPPORT directory of your
  Exchange CD to view and manipulate these messages.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the version of the Mapi32.dll file that is installed
on your computer is not compatible with the installed Exchange Server service
pack.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, verify that the Mapi32.dll file on your system is the
correct version for the currently installed Exchange Server service pack. If the
version installed on your system is incorrect, replace Mapi32.dll with the
correct version.

To determine the version of the Mapi32.dll file on your computer, follow these
steps:

1. Navigate to the &lt;drive&gt;:\winnt\system32 folder.

2. Right-click Mapi32.dll, and then click Properties.

3. In the Properties dialog box, click the Version tab. Note the version number
  that is displayed at the top of this window.

4. Ensure that the version number matches the service pack that is installed on
  your computer. To do this, consult the following table.

  Service pack version         Mapi32.dll version number
  ------------------------------------------------------
  No service pack installed        5.5.1960
  Service Pack 1                   5.5.2232
  Service Pack 2                   5.5.2448
  Service Pack 3                   5.5.2650

To replace the Mapi32.dll file on your computer, follow these steps:

1. In Windows Explorer, right-click the Mapi32.dll file that you located in step
  2 in the first set of steps in the "Resolution" section of this article, and
  then click Rename.

2. Type "Mapi32.dll.old" (without the quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

3. Insert the Exchange Server 5.5 CD-ROM into your computer's CD-ROM or DVD-ROM
  drive, and then navigate to the
  &lt;drive&gt;:\server\enterprise\setup\i386\exchange folder.

4. Right-click the Mapi32.dll file, and then click Copy.

5. In Windows Explorer, navigate to the &lt;drive&gt;:\winnt\system32 folder.

6. On the Edit menu, click Paste.

7. Restart your computer.

NOTE: You must reinstall any Exchange Server service packs that were previously
installed on your computer.
