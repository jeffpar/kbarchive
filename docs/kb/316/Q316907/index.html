SUMMARY
=======

Use this step-by-step guide to run a post-setup executable for setup programs
you create with InstallShield Express - Visual FoxPro Limited Edition. This
program ships with Visual FoxPro 7.0.

Items to Check in InstallShield
-------------------------------

The InstallShield process has six steps. In three of these steps, you will need
to include items:

- Step 2: Specifying the files to include in the installation. In this step,
  include the executable that you want to run at the end of the installation.

- Step 4: Selecting the dialog boxes that will be displayed in the setup.
  Include the Setup Complete Success dialog box. The following table lists the
  options you need to set:

  Option                        Setting
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Show Launch Program           Yes
  Program File                  Executable you want to run
  Command Line Parameters       Any parameters that you need.

- Step 6: Preparing the setup for release. If you are building a SingleImage
  setup, set the Include Setup.exe option to No.

Build your setup.

Use Orca to Edit the .msi File
------------------------------

Every time you build the setup in InstallShield, follow these steps:

1. Use the Orca tool to open the Default.msi file. For information about how to
  obtain Orca, see the "References" section later in this article.

2. In the Tables column, locate ControlCondition.

3. In the Dialog column, locate SetupCompleteSuccess. In the Control_ column,
  locate CheckLaunchProgram. In the Action column, change Show to Hide.

4. In the Dialog column, locate SetupCompleteSuccess. In the Control_ column,
  locate LaunchProgramText. In the Action column, change Show to Hide.

5. In the Tables column, locate ControlEvent.

6. In the Dialog_ column, locate SetupCompleteSuccess. In the Argument column,
  locate LaunchProgramFileFromSetupCompleteSuccess. Replace all of the text in
  the Condition column with a 1.

7. Save the .msi file and quit Orca.
