-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Host Account Cache (HAC) database may contain Windows NT or Windows 2000
machine accounts in addition to user accounts when multiple Windows NT or
Windows 2000 domains participate in an SNA Server 4.0 Host Security Integration
environment.

The HAC database contains only machine accounts from Windows NT or Windows 2000
domains that are not running the SNA Host Account Cache service.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Host Account Cache service fails to obtain detailed account information
for accounts that exist in Windows NT or Windows 2000 domains other than the
domain in which the service is running. Without this detailed account
information, the SNA Host Account service cannot determine if the account is a
machine account. The result is that machine accounts from the nonlocal domains
are added to the HAC database.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server versions
4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The following Knowledge Base article describes an update to the SNA Host Account
Cache service that is included in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 3:

  Q235977 Windows NT Machine Accounts Added to Host Account Cache

This change prevents the addition of machine accounts to the HAC database in host
security environments that consist of a single Windows NT or Windows 2000
domain. However, environments that include multiple domains that participate in
a host security configuration for Single Sign-On (SSO) or Password
Synchronization may continue to experience this problem.

Many customers implement Master Domain or Multiple Master Domain models in their
Windows NT or Windows 2000 environments. Please refer to the following Knowledge
Base article for more information about how to configure host security in a
multiple domain environment:

  Q194695 How to Configure Host Security for a Multi-Domain Environment

The following is an example of a Master Domain model that implements the SNA
Server 4.0 Host Security Integration feature.

The sample Master Domain model consists of a domain called ACCOUNTS, where all of
the user accounts exist, and a resource domain called RESOURCE. The SNA Server
systems are in the RESOURCE domain. The Primary Domain Controller (PDC) for the
RESOURCE domain is running the following host security integration features:

- SNA Host Account Cache service
- SNA WinNT Account Synchonization service

The PDC for the ACCOUNTS domain is running the following host security
integration feature:

- SNA WinNT Account Synchonization service

In this configuration, machine accounts in the RESOURCE domain are not added to
the HAC database. However, machine accounts from the ACCOUNTS domain are added
to the HAC database whenever a new computer joins the ACCOUNTS domain or
whenever the password for an existing machine account changes.

When you use Snacfg.exe (the SNA Server command line configuration utility) to
view the accounts contained in the HAC database, your results may be similar to
the following:

  

  HSMAPPING ACCOUNTS\NTWRKSTN-3$ /ADD /HSDOMAIN:HOSTDOM /HSUSER:?UNINITIALIZED?
  HSMAPPING ACCOUNTS\hostsec1 /ADD /HSDOMAIN:HOSTDOM /HSUSER:?UNINITIALIZED?
  HSMAPPING ACCOUNTS\hostsec2 /ADD /HSDOMAIN:HOSTDOM /HSUSER:?UNINITIALIZED?
  HSMAPPING RESOURCE\testuser /ADD /HSDOMAIN:HOSTDOM /HSUSER:?UNINITIALIZED?
  HSMAPPING ACCOUNTS\NTWRKSTN-4$ /ADD /HSDOMAIN:HOSTDOM /HSUSER:?UNINITIALIZED? 

The entries that end with a dollar sign ($) are Windows NT or Windows 2000
machine accounts.
