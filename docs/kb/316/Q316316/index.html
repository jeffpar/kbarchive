SYMPTOMS
========

When you compress a package to send to subsites, the Distribution Manager
component in the Systems Management Server (SMS) executive may log the following
error message and the package may not be compressed:

  Cannot write to output file, Win32 Error = 998

RESOLUTION
==========

There is a hotfix for this problem. However, Microsoft recommends that you apply
the hotfix that is described in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q319207 SMS: Retrying a Package Update May Create Many Jobs

This is a closely related problem, and the hotfix that is described in Q319207
also contains the fix for the problem that is described in this article.

WORKAROUND
==========

This error occurs only with multistreamed source files. To work around the
problem, remove the alternate data streams from the source files. To do this,
copy the source files to a non-NTFS partition, and then copy them back to the
source folder on the NTFS partition.

For more information about data streams, please see the following Microsoft
Developer Network (MSDN) Web site:

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnfiles/html/ntfs5.asp

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
