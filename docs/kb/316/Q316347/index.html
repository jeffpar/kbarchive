SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the uses and risks of the HiSecWeb security template.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  Hisecweb.exe

The HiSecWeb security template is a Microsoft Windows 2000 and Microsoft Windows
XP security template that is designed to help secure Internet Information
Services (IIS) at the operating system level. HiSecWeb is a baseline security
template that is not intended to work with every configuration and has not been
tested with all applications. You should not apply this template before you
install applications on your computer, because some settings may prevent
software installation and proper configuration.

The possible effects and ramifications of security templates are vast and
wide-ranging. It is vital that you understand security templates before you
apply a security template to a server, especially if the server is in
production. The templates are very successful at securing a server, but may
cause unwanted results and render the server inoperable.

NOTE: Microsoft does not recommend that you install HiSecWeb on a domain
controller. HiSecWeb is not designed to operate seamlessly on a domain
controller, and is known to cause serious domain problems if IIS is installed on
a domain controller.

Before you apply the HiSecWeb security template, you should complete the
following actions:

- Open the security template in the Security Templates Microsoft Management
  Console (MMC) and review the changes that the template is designed to make to
  the server. Compare the settings of the HiSecWeb security template to the
  current settings of your computer to determine the changes that will be made
  and to make sure that the potential changes are acceptable. For more
  information about how to do this, see the following Microsoft Web site:

  From Blueprint to Fortress: A Guide to Securing IIS 5.0
  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/TechNet/prodtechnol/iis/deploy/depovg/securiis.asp

- Test all portions of your application to ensure proper behavior and
  configuration.

To apply the HiSecWeb template, follow these steps:

1. Download and install Hisecweb.exe.

2. Copy the Hisecweb.inf file to the %SystemRoot%\Security\Templates folder.

For detailed instructions on how to install the HiSecWeb security template, see
the following Microsoft Web site:

  From Blueprint to Fortress: A Guide to Securing IIS 5.0
  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/TechNet/prodtechnol/iis/deploy/depovg/securiis.asp

article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q309689 HOW TO: Apply Predefined Security Templates

If you are only securing IIS without using operating system-level modifications,
the recommended method is to apply the IIS Lockdown tool. The Lockdown tool
makes IIS-specific changes (such as changes to the metabase and URLScan); it
does not make underlying operating system changes as does the security
template.


The IIS Lockdown tool is available for download from the following Microsoft Web
site:
