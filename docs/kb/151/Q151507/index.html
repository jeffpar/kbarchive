SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses how to play the games included with Magic School Bus
Explores the Ocean (MSB Ocean).

Each ocean area has a game associated with it. The games can be found by
exploring each of the areas. By clicking on the particular animal or plant that
triggers the game you are taken to an offshoot of the current screen, where the
game is played. The games can also be accessed from the back of the bus.
Although the games' primary goal is to entertain, each game also reinforces a
key concept for the area in which it is presented.

GAME DESCRIPTIONS
-----------------

Crab Race - The Sandy Beach:

The crab race game is a hand and eye coordination game, featuring Clarence the
Crab. The game starts with a closeup view of the beach. Your crab is near the
water. Clams are scattered around on the beach. In the sky, flying overhead, are
sea gulls. The object of the game is to race the crab to its food (the clams)
while preventing the sea gulls from eating the crab, by hiding in the sand. You
control the running and burrowing of the crab by clicking with the mouse. For
each "beach" completed, you are awarded a Fish Card.

Ride the Tide - The Tide Pools:

This game shows how fish are affected by the tides. On the bottom half of the
screen you control a fish, making it swim along the intertidal zone to find
food. You control the fish and decide whether to advance it, stop it, or make it
jump. The fish's movement in the water occurs while the tide is changing from
high to low and back again. The game ends if the fish gets trapped in a dry
tidepool, or gets its food and leaves the screen. Win Fish Cards along the way.

Kelp Diving - The Kelp Forest:

Keesha is in the Kelp forest with a trash bag on her back. The goal in this game
is to help Keesha collect as much trash as possible. To pick up the trash, move
Keesha to the object and click. If the trash hits a sea creature, the creature
disappears.

Maze of Coral - The Coral Reef:

The object of this game is to guide Shannon Shark through a complex maze of
coral. During the race you collect objects. To win, you must find your way out
of the maze.

Food Chain Puzzle - The Open Ocean:

This game presents the concept of which animals eat which animals by putting
together puzzle pieces of a particular open ocean animal. The next puzzle to be
solved is the animal that eats the one you just created.

The Luminous Game - The Deep Ocean:

In this game, you control a hatchetfish in the dark of the deep ocean. The screen
is filled with lights made by other creatures found in the deep sea. Some of
these fish are the enemies of the hatchet. You have to click on the
configuration of lights to find friendly fish. If you click on a friendly fish,
the hatchet continues its journey to collect food. If you click on the wrong
fish, the hatchetfish is eaten and you have to start again. The goal of the game
is for the hatchetfish to finish its journey alive.

Viper Feeder - The Deep Sea Vents:

In this game, you guide a viperfish, Stealth, in his quest for food (lantern
fish). But Stealth doesn't have a lot of energy to spare, you must therefore
develop a strategy for catching the most fish by moving the least.
