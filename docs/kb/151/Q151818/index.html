SUMMARY
=======

By default, the Visual Basic 4.0 Setup Wizard creates one program group using
the project name, and one icon within the program group for the executable file
generated by the project. This article shows how to create additional program
groups and more than one icon within a group for any additional executable files
you want to ship by customizing the Visual Basic Setup Toolkit's SETUP1.VBP
project.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SETUP1.VBP project in the Visual Basic 4.0 Setup Toolkit has two functions
defined in the SETUP1.BAS file, CreateOSProgramGroup() and CreateOSLink(), that
allow you to add program groups and icons. By default, the Form_Load event of
SETUP1.FRM calls these two functions to create only one program group and one
program icon. More program groups and icons can be added by calling these two
functions multiple times and specifying new group names and additional
executable file names. After you rebuild the SETUP1.EXE file, the modified
version will be used in subsequent Setup programs created by the Visual Basic
Setup Wizard. The SETUP1.VBP project is located in \SETUPKIT\SETUP1 subdirectory
of the main Visual Basic directory.

NOTE: Customizing SETUP1.EXE will make it unusable for other projects.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Backup all files in \SETUPKIT\SETUP1 subdirectory of the main Visual Basic
  directory. This directory is also mirrored on the product CD-ROM in the
  VB\SETUPKIT\SETUP1 directory.

2. Load SETUP1.VBP, and locate the Form_Load event of the SETUP1.FRM.

3. In Form_Load event, look for the section with the following comments:

        '
        'Create program groups and icons (or links, i.e. shortcuts)
        '

4. Find the lines where CreateOSProgramGroup() and CreateOSLink() are called:

        CreateOSProgramGroup frmSetup1, strGroupName, strGrpPath
        CreateOSLink frmSetup1, gsDest.strAppDir &amp; gstrAppExe, "", _
        gstrAppName

5. Comment out those lines.

6. Before the line:

        If fCreateGroup Then

        set fCreateGroup and fAdditionalIcons to TRUE:

        fCreateGroup = TRUE
        fAdditionalIcons = TRUE

7. Suppose this setup program will create one program group called MyGroup1 that
  contains MyExe1.Exe and MyExe2.Exe, and another group called MyGroup2 that
  contains MyExe3.Exe and MyExe4.Exe. Suppose that the destination directory
  for each of the EXE files is $(APPPATH) [ASCII 150] the default. In the
  places where CreateOSProgramGroup and CreateOSLink are originally called
  (step 4), type in the following code:

        CreateOSProgramGroup frmSetup1, "MyGroup1", "MyGroup1.GRP"
        CreateOSLink frmSetup1, gsDest.strAppDir &amp; "MyExe1.EXE", "",_
        "MyExe1", TRUE
        CreateOSLink frmSetup1, gsDest.strAppDir &amp; "MyExe2.EXE", "",_
        "MyExe2", TRUE

        CreateOSProgramGroup frmSetup1, "MyGroup2", "MyGroup2.GRP"
        CreateOSLink frmSetup1, gsDest.strAppDir &amp; "MyExe3.EXE", "",_
        "MyExe3", TRUE
        CreateOSLink frmSetup1, gsDest.strAppDir &amp; "MyExe4.EXE", "",_
        "MyExe4", TRUE

NOTE: Under Windows NT, a program remover icon is created at the last program
group. For this example, the icon will be at MyGroup2.

1. Build SETUP1.EXE.

2. Use Setup Wizard to build the setup program. This setup program will create
  two program groups, and each program group will contain two EXE files.

3. Restore the original SETUP1.VBP files to the \SETUPKIT\SETUP1 subdirectory of
  your main Visual Basic directory.
