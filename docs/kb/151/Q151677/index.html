SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain conditions, computers that connect to a process on a Windows NT
computer may fail. For example, the computer may time-out, applications may stop
responding, or the computer may disconnect. On the network you may also see
increased retransmissions.

This has been observed with SQL Server where clients access the database using
ODBC over SPX but it may happen with any SPX-based communication.

CAUSE
=====

The SQL server numbers the frames (for example, 23) when it sends data to the
client. The client indicates that it has received the frame and specifies with
an Allocation Number if it can receive another frame (for example, 24).

If the client-side SPX protocol cannot receive another frame because the process
did not copy the data and gave it another buffer, it does not increment its
Allocation Number (for example, send 23). This is especially true for database
applications as they may perform a considerable amount of work locally.

The sending station should refrain from sending frames until it receives another
frame with an updated Allocation Number. The problem introduced in Service Pack
2 is that Windows NT NWLink SPX ignores the Allocation Number field and
continues to send frames. After this happens, one of the stations eventually
decides that the session is out of synch and disconnects.

When the connection starts over the two stations are likely to run into the same
problem again.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
