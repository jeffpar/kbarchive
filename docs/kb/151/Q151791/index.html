The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Mail Connector interchange (MSMI) appears to stop processing
inbound mail; thread activity as viewed in Performance Monitor declines on all
but thread 5 (single CPU). After a period of time the MSMI service may
completely stop. On active mail systems, P1 files may back up in the P1
directory of the shadow postoffice. Additionally, maximum MSMI logging level
will repeatedly log the following sequence:


  Event ID: 2384
  Source: MSExchangeMSMI
  Description: MS Mail Connector Interchange has established an MTA
  session for uploading messages to the Exchange server.

  Event ID: 10000
  Source: MSExchangeMSMI
  Description: ...value=:      &lt;&lt;&lt; note, this could vary

  Event ID: 2342
  Source: MSExchangeMSMI
  Description: MS Mail Connector Interchange failed to put into XOM
  stream.
  Return code is 0x15.

  Event ID: 2553           &lt;&lt;&lt; logged at level 0
  Source: MSExchangeMSMI
  Description: The thread in MS Mail Connector that delivers to Exchange
  has failed writing out data to the MTA.

CAUSE
=====

A message containing an invalid address is being submitted to the message
transfer agent (MTA) by the MSMI. The MTA returns an error, so the MSMI
refreshes the submitting thread (possibly submitting the same message again).
This cycle can block the inbound processing thread.


WORKAROUND
==========

No workaround exists. However, stopping and restarting the MSExchangeMTA and
MSExchangeMSMI services typically allows some inbound processing to continue
until the bad message is submitted once again (event log will start logging the
above listed sequence).

On multiprocessor computers, there can be additional inbound processing threads,
therefore until all inbound threads become blocked, some inbound processing can
continue.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
