SUMMARY
=======

In Mastering Access Programming, Chapter 9: Database Replication, the answer to
question #6 in the Self-Check is wrong.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Chapter 9: Database Replication, question #6 in the Self-Check states:

  What is the term for when Microsoft Jet detects that the same record was
  changed at both members of the replica set?

giving the following as answer choices:

- Design Error.

- Design Conflict.

- Synchronization Error &lt;I: Synchronization errors occur when a data change
  at one replica set member cannot be applied to another member because it
  violates a constraint such as a referential integrity rule or uniqueness
  assertion.

- Synchronization Conflict &lt;C: Synchronization Conflict is the term for when
  Microsoft Jet detects that the same record was changed at both members of the
  replica set.

The program gives the correct answer as Synchronization Error.

The right answer is actually Synchronization Conflict.

This answer can be validated by going to the "Replication Issues" topic, and then
choosing "Synchronization Conflict" where the first paragraph states:

Synchronization conflicts occur when Microsoft Jet detects that the same record
was changed at both members of the replica set. Even if the changes made at one
replica set member were in different fields than the changes made at the other
member, Microsoft Jet treats it as a synchronization conflict.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed above. We
are researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
