MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Q. What exactly is the New MSN?

  A. The New MSN is an entirely new product with new content and a new user
  interface. The new user interface will allow MSN Members to use MSN as a
  program viewer for viewing the MSN content and as a browser for viewing sites
  on the Internet.

2. Q. Is it possible to use the Old MSN and the New MSN at the same time?

  A. Yes, it is possible to access both the Old MSN and the New MSN
  simultaneously, because the New MSN acts exactly like any other Web site and
  is a separate software product.

  To find the Old MSN:
  1. Click Essentials in the Program Viewer.

  2. Click MSN Classic and Custom Page.

  3. Click Classic Categories.

  In the near future, we will be discontinuing the old MSN in order to make room
  for other interesting programs.

3. Q. Which of the old MSN files can I delete from my hard drive now that I have
  installed the new MSN?

  A. We do not recommend that you delete any of the old MSN files at this time.
  The removal of these files may interfere with the functionality of the new
  MSN.

4. Q. What are MSN Premier Memberships?

  A. These are subscription plans that include access to communications services
  and additional exclusive content. Premier Memberships are available both with
  or without Internet access from Microsoft.

  The pricing plans are as follows:
  1. MSN Premier Plan $6.95/month 5 hours/month included $2.50 each additional
     hour

  2. MSN Premier Unlimited Plan $19.95/month Unlimited usage

  3. MSN Premier ISDN Unlimited Plan $49.95/month Unlimited usage

  4. MSN Premier Destinations Plan (for people who already have Internet
     access) $6.95/month Unlimited access to MSN content
