SUMMARY
=======

This article contains a copy of the information in the Readme.txt file included
with the Windows 95 Support Assistant.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 95 Support Assistant
----------------------------

The Windows 95 Support Assistant version 1.0a was originally released to some
Windows 95 Beta testers as the Windows 95 Care Package. The Support Assistant
boasts a new look and much more content.

When you install the Support Assistant in Windows 95, it uses the online Help
search engine in Windows 95 to let you navigate among topics easily.

The Support Assistant Files
---------------------------

Assist.cnt - The Support Assistant Help contents file. This file allows the use
of the Windows 95 Contents page.
Assist.hlp - The main Support Assistant Help file. This is the only file required
for use in Windows 3.x and Windows for Workgroups 3.1x.
Assist.ico - Icon for the Support Assistant.
Hcl.hlp - Windows 95 Hardware Compatibility List. This file is produced by the
Windows 95 Development Team.
Readme.txt - This file.
Win95app.hlp - Windows 95 Application Compatibility List. This file is produced
by the Windows 95 Development Team.

Installation Notes
------------------

Windows 95:

When you install the Support Assistant in the Windows\HELP folder, you can easily
jump or switch to other online Help files. If you specify a different folder you
may receive the following error message when you jump to a different Help file
topic:

Cannot find the Windows.hlp file

If a program or driver replaces a Windows 95 Help file you may encounter problems
when you jump to another Help file topic. For example the text of the topic may
be incorrect or the topic may not exist. Both the Microsoft IntelliPoint
software version 2.0 and the Microsoft IntelliType software version 1.1 replace
Windows 95 Help files.

Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups:

The Support Assistant installs files in a folder called Assist. If you try to
jump to a Windows 95 Help topic you may receive one of the following error
messages:

- Topic not found

  -or-

- Cannot open Help file
