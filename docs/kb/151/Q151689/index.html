-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When starting the Microsoft Exchange Key Management Server (KM Server) the
following error is received.

  The Microsoft Exchange Key Manager service returned service specific error 1

The Windows NT Event Log might have the following error message.

  The Exchange KM service failed to start. Ensure that the KMSMSG.DLL and
  KMSERVER.EXE files have the same version and are in the same location and
  that you have provided the KM server password in the startup parameters in
  the services panel.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two main reasons why the above error message can be generated:

- The service account for KM Server is wrong or the password for the system
  account is wrong.

- The password for the KM service startup parameters was not specified and the
  KM Server floppy is not accessible. The floppy disk might not be present
  because the option to create a KM Server floppy disk might not have been
  selected during installation of the KM Server

To correct this problem, verify that the system account for the Microsoft
Exchange Key Manager service is the same account being used by the Microsoft
Exchange Directory service.

This problem can also occur if, during the installation of the Microsoft Exchange
KM Server, an error was encountered writing the data to the floppy drive.

The password for the Key Manager startup parameters must be entered every time
the KM service is started . This is the password that was received during
installation of the KM server. This password can be stored on a floppy which is
in the drive every time the KM server is started. This floppy should have a file
called Kmspwd.ini with the following information:

  [config]
  pwd=&lt;14 character password&gt;

For example:

  [config]
  pwd=ABCDEFGHIJKLMN
