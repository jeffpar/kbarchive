-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Mail Connector interchange (MSMI) stops processing outbound mail.
This can be evidenced by the following symptoms:

- A backlog builds in the message transfer agent's (MTA's) MSMI queue.

- In Performance Monitor, observe thread object "% processor time" counter for
  all MT.EXE threads. One or more threads above number 3 will show no processor
  utilization (threads 0 through 3 typically show no processor utilization
  except during startup, shutdown, or thread and data refresh).

- With MSMI logging set to maximum the application event log will cease logging
  "Sent" events (ID 2448) (although other MSMI events may still be logged).

- The service stops with no event log warning or DrWtsn32.LOG.

- The service may not respond to control functions nor appear stopped. In the
  severe, Kill.exe fails to free the service and the computer has to be
  restarted.

CAUSE
=====

During thread restart, an exception occurs while accessing a [null] pointer in
the thread environment block (TEB) that is supposed to hold a pointer to the
thread's thread local storage (TLS) area.
