-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Clients scan hardware or software at every logon even though Every 1 Days is
specified in the Inventory section of the Site Properties. If the interval every
two days is specified, the scan occurs daily. If the interval specified is every
three days, the scan occurs as expected.

CAUSE
=====

The Sms.ini SoftwareScanInterval or HardwareScanInterval is set at a value one
greater than it should be.

The SoftwareScanInterval or HardwareScanInterval, when set at every one (1) day,
will be set to one (that is, always) in the Sms.ini, although it should be set
at two.

When set at two days, the SoftwareScanInterval or HardwareScanInterval will be
set at two (that is, daily) in the SMS.INI, although it should be set at three.

When set at three days, the SoftwareScanInterval or HardwareScanInterval will be
set at three (interval), and scans every 3 days.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

- To specify daily scans, type "Every 2 Days."

- To specify scans every three days or less frequently, type the interval as
  you normally would.

NOTE: this problem precludes specifying an interval of two days.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
