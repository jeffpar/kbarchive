SYMPTOMS
========

After you use Microsoft Backup to restore files, you may receive the following
error message:

  Errors occurred during this operation. Do you want to view them now?

Clicking Yes displays the error.log file, which contains the following errors:

  Microsoft Backup has encountered an unexpected error number. Quit and restart
  Backup, and then try again.

  Microsoft Backup cannot find this file. If this is a network file, the
  network may not be available. Or, the file Backup is looking for may have
  been deleted or moved.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the files are being restored to a path that includes
a logical drive letter that does not exist on the computer.

For example, this behavior can occur if files are backed up from drive E on one
computer and then restored on a different computer that does not have a logical
drive E. By default, Backup attempts to restore files to the original location.
Because the drive is not present, Backup is unable to restore the files.

RESOLUTION
==========

To enable Backup to restore files to an alternate location, follow these steps:

1. In Backup, click Options on the Settings menu.

2. Click the Restore tab.

3. Click Alternate Location.

4. Click OK.

5. Try to restore the files again.
