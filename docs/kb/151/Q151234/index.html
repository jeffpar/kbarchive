- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a Windows NT Remote Access client to make multiple simultaneous
outbound connections to different remote TCP/IP networks, some packets may not
be sent or may be sent via the wrong modem.

This problem only occurs if two or more modems are attempting to send packets to
their respective remote networks at the same time.

CAUSE
=====

The cause is currently under investigation.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is currently no resolution or workaround to this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To illustrate, suppose your RAS client has three modems, A, B, and C. Modem A
dials RAS server A, modem B dials RAS server B, and modem C dials RAS server C.
The IP addresses for both ends of the RAS connection are as follows:

  Modem A (192.1.1.2) -/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/-&gt; Server A (192.1.1.1)

  Modem B (193.1.1.2) -/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/-&gt; Server B (193.1.1.1)

  Modem C (194.1.1.2) -/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/-&gt; Server C (194.1.1.1)

If modem A is in the process of sending a ping to the address of RAS server A,
modem B and modem C would be unable to successfully ping RAS server B and RAS
server C (respectively).

If modem B attempts to ping RAS server B while modem A is in the process of
pinging RAS server A, the ping would be unsuccessful and either four instances
of "HARDWARE ERROR" or four instances of "DESTINATION HOST UNREACHABLE" are
returned for the results of the ping to server B.

"DESTINATION HOST UNREACHABLE" is returned because the ping that should have been
sent to RAS server B is instead sent to the IP address of server A, which modem
B has no connection to.

For example, the ping command would be "PING 193.1.1.1", but the result would
look like the following:

Reply from 192.1.1.1: DESTINATION HOST UNREACHABLE Reply from 192.1.1.1:
DESTINATION HOST UNREACHABLE Reply from 192.1.1.1: DESTINATION HOST UNREACHABLE
Reply from 192.1.1.1: DESTINATION HOST UNREACHABLE
