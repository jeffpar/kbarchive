SUMMARY
=======

The Cisco Internet Junction provides direct access for Novell clients to the
resources of the Internet (World Wide Web, FTP, News, Telnet).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The software enables you to run Winsock 1.1-compliant TCP/IP applications over
IPX without having to install a TCP/IP stack at every workstation. Only one IP
address is required to connect an entire Novell network.

The Cisco Internet Junction also acts as a firewall. Since IP addresses are not
located anywhere on the LAN, the network is effectively isolated from the
Internet.

Internet Junction software is independent of your connection to the Internet.
Internet Junction software works with any type of connection you may have to the
Internet.

As of April 1996, the latest version is 1.2.2.
