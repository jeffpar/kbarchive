-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1, 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use version 2.1, 3.0, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, when you
attempt to create or modify a local user by using the MS Mail Administrator
program (Admin.exe), clicking Local-Admin, and then clicking either Create or
Modify, the following error message may be displayed:

  Notice 93 Template file does not match data file. Press Enter to continue.

CAUSE
=====

This error message is displayed if the Admin.tpl file has been modified and no
longer corresponds to the records in the existing Admin.inf file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, rename or delete the existing Admin.inf file and use
the MS Mail Administrator program to re-enter the template information by
modifying each of the local addresses.

You can also resolve this problem by using the Template utility (Template.exe)
that is located in the Mailexe folder. This utility allows you to transfer the
contents of the Admin.inf file into the Admin.txt text file, where you can
modify the information to match the information in the existing Admin.tpl file.
You can then convert this manually modified Admin.txt file to a new Admin.inf
file by using the Template utility. To use this utility, you must do the
following:

1. Using a text editor, remove the template field prompts that were added to the
  Admin.inf file that resulted in the error message in the "Symptoms" section
  of this article.

2. At a DOS prompt, change to the Inf subfolder of the Mail database.

3. Type the following command:

  "type nul &gt; admin.txt" (without the quotation marks)

  This command creates a 0 byte file, the Admin.txt file, in the Inf subfolder.

4. Go to the root of the MS Mail database.

5. Change to the drive and subfolder that contain the MS Mail executable files.
  This is usually the Mailexe subfolder.

6. Type the following (this example assumes that the Maildata subfolder is in
  the root of drive M):

  template m:\tpl\admin.tpl m:\inf\admin.inf m:\inf\admin.txt -dm

7. Change to the Inf subfolder.

8. Use a text editor to modify the Admin.txt file so that it matches the new
  Admin.tpl format (refer to step 11 for more details). For more information
  about the Admin.tpl file and MS Mail templates, see Chapter 8 of the
  Microsoft Mail Administrator's Guide.

  NOTE: Add the template field prompts in a new line right before the end of
  each record in the Admin.txt file. The end of the record marker is a pair of
  tildes "~~" (without the quotation marks) in a separate line. If you use the
  sample field prompts of "Given Name" and "Surname," the field prompts appear
  right before the end of record marker as follows:

  Given Name:~
  Surname:~
  ~~

  Also note that the tilde at the end of the line is a data field placeholder.
  This tilde can also be replaced with the actual data that is entered for the
  user data.

9. At the DOS prompt, rename the Admin.inf file to Admin.old. From the DOS
  prompt, type the following command:

  ren admin.inf *.old

10. Change to the TPL subdirectory.

11. Use a text editor to modify the Admin.tpl file so that it contains the
  template field prompts that you removed in step 1. If you use the sample
  template field prompts that are supplied in step 8, the template field
  prompts are displayed as follows:

  Surname:~15~10~ULP~Lastname~
  Given Name:~15~10~ULP~Firstname~

12. Go to the root of the MS Mail database.

13. Change to the drive and subfolder that contain the MS Mail executable files.
  This is usually the Mailexe subfolder.

14. Type the following (this example assumes that the Maildata subfolder is in
  the root of drive M):

  template m:\tpl\admin.tpl m:\inf\admin.txt m:\inf\admin.inf -dm

These steps create a new Admin.inf file that matches the current Admin.tpl file.
