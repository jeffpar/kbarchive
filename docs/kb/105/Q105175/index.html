The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, when a user tries
to move the Mail message file (MMF) from the postoffice to the local computer
(or vice versa), the following error message may be displayed:

  Mail failed to relocate your message file

This error message may occur if there is insufficient free disk space on the
target drive or if the MSMAIL.INI file is marked as Read Only.

RESOLUTION
==========

If there is insufficient disk space, you can resolve the problem by freeing disk
space on the target drive.

If the MSMAIL.INI file is marked as Read Only, simply changing the properties of
the MSMAIL.INI file will not resolve the problem. After changing the properties
of the MSMAIL.INI file, another error message will be displayed the next time
the user logs into the Windows client:

  Your message file could not be found

The user is then prompted for the location of an .MMF file.

Mail for Windows uses the MSMAIL.INI file to write intermediate information while
the .MMF file is being transferred. Because the MSMAIL.INI file is marked Read
Only, this information cannot be written and hence the error occurs. Even though
the .MMF file was not relocated, the ACCESS3.GLB file was changed to reflect the
intended new location.

If the .MMF file is on the postoffice, perform the following steps:

1. Determine the user's 8-digit ID number. You can determine this number in one
  of two ways:

   - Use USRDUMP.EXE or LISTUSER.EXE.

   - Log in to the MS-DOS client and move the user's folders to
     Private-Storage. This creates an .IDX file with the same filename as the
     user's 8-digit ID. After the user's ID has been determined, the user's
     private folders should be moved back to the server.

2. Copy the user's .MMF file (&lt;user's 8 digit ID&gt;.MMF) from the MMF
  directory on the postoffice to the user's local computer.

  The exact location of the .MMF file is now known.

3. Start Microsoft Mail. After the user signs in, the following error message is
  displayed:

  Your Message file could not be found

  The Open Message File dialog box will then be displayed.

4. Select the correct .MMF file.

The user should now be able to move the .MMF file to or from local storage.
