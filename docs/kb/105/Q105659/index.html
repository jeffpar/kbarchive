The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Access versions 1.0, 1.1, 2.0 
- Microsoft Access Distribution Kit, version 1.1

SUMMARY
=======

You can run multiple instances of the same application under Microsoft Windows.
When you communicate with an application using DDE, it may be important to be
able to identify which instance of an application should respond to your DDE
commands.

You can initiate a DDE conversation with a specific instance of an application by
appending the application's Task ID number to the application name argument in
the DDE initiate command.

This article assumes that you are familiar with Access Basic and with creating
Microsoft Access applications using the programming tools provided with
Microsoft Access. For more information about Access Basic, please refer to the
"Introduction to Programming" manual in Microsoft Access version 1.x, or the
"Building Applications" manual, Chapter 3, "Introducing Access Basic" in version
2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Each instance of each application started in Windows is assigned a unique number
called a Task ID. This number can be used to distinguish among multiple
instances of an application.

To initiate a DDE conversation using the System topic with an instance of
Microsoft Excel that has a Task ID of 34567, you could use the following sample
command:

  Chan = DDEInitiate("excel34567", "System")

If you do not specify a Task ID number, you will initiate a conversation with the
first instance of the application that Windows finds. Note that the order in
which Windows finds instances of an application does not always correspond to
the order in which the applications were started.

How to Get the Task ID of an Application
----------------------------------------

You can get the Task ID of an application by doing one of the following:

- Use the Access Basic shell command to launch the application. The shell
  command will return the application's Task ID if the application is launched
  successfully.

-or-

- Use an Access Basic function to find the Task ID. The following sample
  function can be used to find an application's Task ID:

Notes
-----

- In the following sample code, an underscore (_) is used as a line-
  continuation character. Remove the underscore from the end of the line when
  re-creating this code in Access Basic.

- You may have some Microsoft Windows API functions defined in an existing
  Microsoft Access library; therefore, your declarations may be duplicates. If
  you receive a duplicate procedure name error message, remove or comment out
  the declarations statement in your code.

        Option Explicit

        Declare Function GetActiveWindow Lib "User" () As Integer
        Declare Function GetWindowWORD Lib "User" (ByVal hWnd As Integer, _
           ByVal nIndex As Integer) As Integer
        Const GWW_HINSTANCE = (-6)

        Function GetActiveTaskID ()
           GetActiveTaskID = GetWindowWORD(GetActiveWindow(), _
              GWW_HINSTANCE)
        End Function

The following Access Basic code demonstrates the use of both of these techniques
in getting the Task ID:

     Function TestTaskID()
        Dim TaskID
        TaskID = Shell("excel", 1)
        MsgBox TaskID &amp; " and " &amp; GetActiveTaskID()
     End Function

How to Use an Application's Task ID in a DDE Conversation
---------------------------------------------------------

The following example demonstrates how to use Task IDs to indicate which instance
of an application should be used in a DDE conversation. This sample code will
launch two instances of Microsoft Excel, start a DDE conversation with each
instance, and poke data to Sheet1 of each instance:

     Function DDEWithTwoInstances ()
        Dim TaskID1, TaskID2
        Dim Chan1, Chan2

        ' Start 2 instances of Microsoft Excel and record Task ID numbers.
        TaskID1 = Shell("excel.exe", 1)
        TaskID2 = Shell("excel.exe", 1)

        ' Initiate DDE conversations with both instances using
        ' the Task ID numbers. Trap an error that may happen
        ' if we try to initiate a conversation and the copy of
        ' Microsoft Excel is still trying to start from the shell command.

        On Error GoTo ExcelNotYetReady
        Chan1 = DDEInitiate("excel" &amp; TaskID1, "Sheet1")
        On Error GoTo 0

        On Error GoTo ExcelNotYetReady
        Chan2 = DDEInitiate("excel" &amp; TaskID2, "Sheet1")
        On Error GoTo 0

        ' Poke information into each instance of Microsoft Excel.

        DDEPoke Chan1, "R1C1", "This is Task1!"
        DDEPoke Chan2, "R1C1", "This is Task2!"

        DDETerminateAll

        Exit Function

     ExcelNotYetReady:
        DoEvents
        Resume

     End Function
