The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

With versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the size of a
Mail message file (MMF) may increase by more than twice the size of a message
received.

Additionally, if the sender of the message selected the Save Copy Of Outgoing
Message In Sent Mail Folder option, the sender's .MMF file may also increase by
more than twice the size of the message sent.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The receiver's .MMF file may increase by more than twice the size of the
received message because as soon as the message is opened for reading, a
temporary (duplicate) copy is created. This duplicate is the size of the
original message. This temporary copy is created to allow the user to modify the
message received and then be given the Save Changes To Message? option. This
process allows the user to discard any changes and restore the original
message.

On the sender's side, a message is created for sending. When the message is sent,
a copy is made and is put into the Sent Mail folder. The original message then
is deleted. Thus, two copies of the message were created, and space had to be
allocated for both these copies. Even though the first copy of the message was
deleted, the space is only logically freed. Until the .MMF compression runs, the
space occupied by the first message will not be physically freed. This is done
so that if another large message (or a set of messages) is sent or received, the
program will be able to work faster, because it already has the disk space
allocated.
