-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following information was taken from the MS-DOS 6.2 README.TXT file.

NOTE: The MS-DOS 6.2 Upgrade and MS-DOS 6.2 Step-Up (both downloadable and disk
versions) include the same README.TXT file.

NOTES ON MS-DOS 6.2
-------------------

3. WINDOWS
----------

3.1 Your computer uses a Windows 3.0 permanent swap file.
---------------------------------------------------------

If your computer uses a Windows 3.0 permanent swap file, run the SPATCH.BAT
program to make the swap file compatible with MS-DOS 6. To do so, carry out the
following procedure:

1. Copy the SPATCH.BAT file to your hard disk. To determine the location of the
  file on the Setup disks, view the PACKING.LST file on Setup Disk 1.

2. Type the following at the command prompt:

  " SPATCH [DRIVE]:[PATH]SWAPFILE.EXE " (without the quotation marks)

  For the DRIVE and PATH parameters, specify the location of your SWAPFILE.EXE
  file.

3. Follow the instructions on your screen.

  The program modifies the SWAPFILE.EXE for use with MS-DOS 6 and saves a backup
  copy as SWAPFILE.SAV. After you have confirmed the file works correctly, you
  can delete the SWAPFILE.SAV file.

3.2 Using compressed floppy disks with Windows File Manager
-----------------------------------------------------------

If you are using compressed floppy disks with automounting enabled, you might
encounter error messages or other problems while using File Manager. To work
around these problems, press the F5 key twice.

For example, if you change from a compressed to an uncompressed floppy disk, the
drive button for the compressed floppy disk's host drive remains until you press
the F5 key twice.

4. HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY WITH MS-DOS
-------------------------------------

4.1 Compaq EXTDISK.SYS Driver
-----------------------------

The Compaq EXTDISK.SYS driver version 3.00 or later is compatible with MS-DOS 6.
If you have a version earlier than 3.00, contact your vendor for an upgrade.

4.2 Hardcard
------------

To use DoubleSpace on a system that uses its Hardcard drive as its startup drive,
see section 7.18. For additional Hardcard information, see the following:

a. Hardcard II

  If you can't use Plus Development Hardcard II or Hardcard II XL when running
  EMM386.EXE, specify the exclude (x=) switch to prevent EMM386 from
  conflicting with the card's BIOS address.

  To configure EMM386, run MemMaker.

b. Hardcard 40 or Passport

  If you are using Hardcard 40 or a Passport removable disk, and you have a
  DEVICE command in your CONFIG.SYS file for PLUSDRV.SYS, disable or remove the
  DEVICE command. Then run MS-DOS 6.2 Setup. After Setup is complete, reenable
  or restore the DEVICE command for PLUSDRV.SYS. Make it the last line in the
  file.

c. If you are unable to access your compressed drive after installing
  DoubleSpace on your Hardcard, try the following:

  1. Add a DBLSPACE /MOUNT command to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to mount the
     compressed volume file on the Hardcard every time you start your computer.

  2. Or, ensure that there is at least one device driver (for example,
     ANSI.SYS) loaded in your CONFIG.SYS file AFTER the ATDOSXL.SYS driver but
     BEFORE the DBLSPACE.SYS driver.

4.3 Toshiba
-----------

If you used the MS-DOS 5.0 version of EMM386 before you ran Setup, and you use
the Power Management function, use the VRESUME program or device driver to avoid
problems with the Resume feature. Carry out the following procedure:

1. Make sure the VRESUME.COM or VRESUME.SYS file is on your hard disk. To load
  the TSR, add a command for VRESUME.COM to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. To load the
  device driver, add a command for the VRESUME.SYS file to your CONFIG.SYS
  file.

2. Save the file, and restart your computer.

  NOTE For information about using VRESUME with Windows 3.0, see the WRESUME.TXT
  file on your Toshiba MS-DOS 5.0 disks.

5. MICROSOFT PROGRAMS
---------------------

5.1 Microsoft Anti-Virus
------------------------

Before cleaning a program file, make sure you have a backup copy of it. If you
clean a program file, and the program is corrupted, reinstall the program. If
Anti-Virus again detects a virus, there is a chance the detection is in error;
contact your software vendor to determine if an updated version of the program
is available.

5.2 Running Microsoft Backup for MS-DOS under Windows
-----------------------------------------------------

You should not run Backup for MS-DOS while Windows is running. However, if you
do, and if your system is not configured correctly, Backup might display the
following symptoms:

- Backup appears to stop running--for example, the clock runs, but there is no
  disk activity.

- Backup reports problems while testing the second floppy disk during the
  compatibility test. For example, it might display a "Diskette not properly
  seated" message or ask for Disk 1 repeatedly.

- Windows displays a message that the DMA buffer size needs to be increased.

- Backup quits unexpectedly.

You can correctly configure your system by carrying out the following procedure.

1. Open your SYSTEM.INI file, and add a DMABufferSize=32 line to the [386Enh]
  section.

2. When you run Backup, make sure that you specify with the Settings command
  from the Control menu that Backup run with the Exclusive and Full Screen
  options.

5.3  Backup for Windows stops running at the end of the compatibility
   test
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If Backup for Windows stops running at the end of the Compatibility Test, you
might be loading an incompatible third-party backup driver in your SYSTEM.INI
file. Carry out the following procedure.

NOTE This procedure disables your third-party backup program.

1. Open your SYSTEM.INI file, and locate the [386Enh] section.

2. Determine whether any of the following lines are included in this section:

  DEVICE=FASTBACK.386
  DEVICE=VFD.386
  DEVICE=CPBVXD.386
  DEVICE=VIRWT.386

3. If you find any of these lines, add a semicolon (;) to the front of the line.

4. Save the file, restart Windows, and run Backup for Windows again.

5.4  Running Microsoft Backup with TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD computers
---------------------------------------------------------------------

To avoid a conflict between the Turbo feature and Microsoft Backup for Windows or
MS-DOS, add a "/L0" (without the quotation marks) switch to the DEVICE command
in your CONFIG.SYS that loads the BATTERY.PRO file. Or, before you run Microsoft
Backup, type "SETPOWER /L0" (without the quotation marks) at the command
prompt.


5.5 Microsoft Defragmenter
--------------------------

If you received the "Insufficient Memory" message from Microsoft Defragmenter,
use the MEM command to determine how much conventional, upper, and extended
(XMS) memory is available. In addition to using all available conventional
memory, Defragmenter can make use of up to 384K of extended memory and 12K of
upper memory.

To increase available memory, carry out the procedures in "An MS-DOS program
displays an out-of-memory message" in the chapter "Diagnosing and Solving
Problems" in the MICROSOFT MS-DOS 6 USER'S GUIDE.

If less than 384K of extended memory is available, carry out the procedures in
"Freeing Extended Memory" in the "Making More Memory Available" chapter in the
MICROSOFT MS-DOS 6 USER'S GUIDE.

6. THIRD-PARTY PROGRAMS
-----------------------

6.1 4DOS and NDOS
-----------------

4DOS and NDOS are compatible with MS-DOS 6. However, to use some of the new
features in MS-DOS 6.2 (such as MemMaker, the LOADHIGH /L switch, DIR
compression switches, and the ability to bypass startup commands), contact JP
Software to obtain 4DOS 4.02 or later, or Symantec to obtain Norton Utilities
7.0 or later.

If you use multiple configurations, 4DOS or NDOS will not automatically run your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file unless you include a /P on the SHELL line in your CONFIG.SYS
file.

To use MS-DOS 6.2 Help instead of 4DOS or NDOS Help, start it by using COMMAND /C
HELP, or define a 4DOS or NDOS alias to run HELP.COM from your MS-DOS 6.2
directory.

6.2 Above Board 286 and Above Board Plus Installation
   Programs
------------------------------------------------------------------

Do not use an Above Board installation program dated May 1989 or earlier until
you disable programs that use extended memory, such as SMARTDrive or RAMDrive.
You might lose data if you leave these programs enabled. After you have
installed Above Board, you can reenable these programs.

6.3 CodeView
------------

CAUTION Using versions 3.0 to 3.13 of the CodeView CV.EXE file may cause data
loss if your system has an 80386 memory manager (such as EMM386.EXE) and device
drivers or programs that use extended memory. To determine which version you
have, type "CV.EXE" (without the quotation marks) at the command prompt.

6.4 Colorado Tape Backup
------------------------

If you receive a message that you have two versions of the VFINTD.386 file
loaded, you probably need to edit your SYSTEM.INI file. To do so, carry out the
following procedure:

1. Open your SYSTEM.INI file and locate the [386Enh] section. You should see two
  lines similar to the following:

  DEVICE=C:\TAPE\CMSDTAPE.386
  DEVICE=C:\DOS\VFINTD.386

2. If you plan to use your Colorado Tape Backup program, add a semi- colon (;)
  before the DEVICE command for the VFINTD.386 file. If you plan to use
  Microsoft Backup, add a semi-colon before the DEVICE command for the
  CMSDTAPE.386 file.

3. Save the file, and restart Windows.

6.5 Fastback Plus
-----------------

If you have a version of Fifth Generation Systems Fastback Plus earlier than 3.0,
use the LOADFIX command before running Fastback Plus or the Fastback Plus
installation program to ensure that you don't lose data. To do so, type the
following at the command prompt:

  " LOADFIX FB.EXE " (without the quotation marks)

or

  " LOADFIX FBINSTAL.EXE " (without the quotation marks)

6.6 Norton Desktop for Windows 2.0
----------------------------------

Setup adds a second Tools menu which contains Microsoft Backup and Antivirus
commands (if you installed these Windows programs), as well as a DoubleSpace
Info command (if DoubleSpace is installed).

If you use DoubleSpace to compress the drive that contains SmartCan, you might
experience system problems afterward. To correct this, reinstall Norton Desktop
for Windows.

For information about Norton AntiVirus and DoubleSpace, see the following
section.

6.7 Norton Utilities
--------------------

The "Clear Space" option of Norton Speed Disk (prior to version 7.0) is
incompatible with DoubleSpace drives. For an updated version of Norton Speed
Disk, contact your software vendor.

Do not use the WipeInfo utility on DoubleSpace drives. It can cause lost
clusters. If you have already used this option, use the SCANDISK command to fix
the lost clusters.

If Norton AntiVirus is running when you use DoubleSpace to compress the drive
that contains the NAV_.SYS file, DoubleSpace leaves a copy of the NAV_.SYS file
on the host drive. This prevents Norton AntiVirus from reporting a virus
infection during the compression process. After the compression process is
complete, you can safely delete the copy of NAV_.SYS on the host drive.

If you use the Norton Cache or Speedrive utilities, load the utility after the
DEVICE command that loads DBLSPACE.SYS. For more information, see section 7.24.

6.8 PC Tools
------------

If PC Shell does not show all of the files or directories on your drive, quit PC
Shell immediately and contact Central Point Software for an update.

  CAUTION: Do not attempt to use PC Shell on that drive; severe data loss might
  occur. This problem affects both compressed and non-compressed drives.

The DISKFIX /SCAN option in PC Tools can cause lost clusters on DoubleSpace
drives. Avoid using this option. (If you have already used this option, use
ScanDisk to fix the lost clusters.)

The FORMAT command of PC Tools version 7.1 conflicts with MS-DOS 6.2. Use the
FORMAT command that comes with MS-DOS 6.2.

The COMPRESS command of PC Tools versions 6.0 and 5.5 is incompatible with
DoubleSpace.

6.9  QEMM's Stealth DoubleSpace Feature
---------------------------------------

The Stealth DoubleSpace feature of QEMM 7.01 is incompatible with MS-DOS 6.2.
Version 7.02 is compatible with MS-DOS 6.2, but not with DEFRAG.EXE or
DoubleSpace's Automount feature. Version 7.03 is fully compatible with MS-DOS
6.2 and DoubleSpace; it is available to all QEMM 7 users through bulletin board
systems such as BIX, CompuServe, and QuarterDeck BBS, as well as directly from
QuarterDeck Office Systems.

If you use the Stealth DoubleSpace feature of QEMM version 7.01 or 7.02, see the
appropriate section below.

QEMM version 7.01
-----------------

The Stealth DoubleSpace feature of QEMM 7.01 is incompatible with MS-DOS 6.2. If
you use QEMM version 7.01 and the Stealth DoubleSpace feature, your computer
will not start properly.

To work around this problem, press F8 when your computer starts. Answer Y to all
prompts except the following:

   DEVICE=C:\QEMM\ST-DBL.SYS [Y/N]?

When MS-DOS displays this prompt, answer N. (The pathname for ST-DBL.SYS may be
different on your computer.) After your computer starts, edit your CONFIG.SYS
file and make the following changes:

- Disable the DEVICE command for ST-DBL.SYS by using the REM command.

- Add a DEVICE command for DBLSPACE.SYS. For example:

   DEVICE=C:\DOS\DBLSPACE.SYS /MOVE

QEMM version 7.02
-----------------

The Stealth DoubleSpace feature of QEMM version 7.02 is compatible with MS-DOS
6.2, with the following exceptions:

- You cannot use QEMM version 7.02's Stealth DoubleSpace feature while
  DoubleSpace's Automount feature is enabled. To turn Automounting off, type
  "DBLSPACE /AUTOMOUNT=O" (without the quotation marks) at the command prompt,
  and then restart your computer.

- You cannot run the Microsoft Defragmenter (DEFRAG.EXE) while QEMM version
  7.02's Stealth DoubleSpace driver is installed. To run DEFRAG.EXE, disable
  the Stealth DoubleSpace driver, and then restart your computer. After you
  finish running DEFRAG.EXE, you can reenable the Stealth DoubleSpace driver
  and restart your computer.

6.10  Johnson Computer Systems PC-Vault and PC-Vault Plus
---------------------------------------------------------

If you use version 4.6 or earlier of the PC-Vault or PC-Vault Plus hard disk
protection system, do not use the Maximum Floppy Boot Protection option if you
use DoubleSpace.

In these versions of PC-Vault and PC-Vault plus, the Maximum Floppy Boot
Protection option is incompatible with DoubleSpace and may cause data loss. If
your version of PC-Vault or PC-Vault Plus is earlier than 4.6, contact Johnson
Computer Systems for an upgrade.

6.11 AddStor Double Tools
-------------------------

AddStor's Double Tools version 1.0 includes a version of DBLSPACE.BIN that is
incompatible with MS-DOS 6.2. When you install Double Tools, do not check the
"Install enhanced DoubleSpace drivers" box. If you do, Double Tools will replace
the MS-DOS 6.2 DBLSPACE.BIN file with the Double Tools version of DBLSPACE.BIN.
The next time you start your computer, it will display the message "Wrong
DBLSPACE.BIN version" and none of your compressed drives will be mounted.
