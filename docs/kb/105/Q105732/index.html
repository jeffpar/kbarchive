The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 differs from previous versions of
Windows (including Windows for Workgroups 3.1) with respect to the requirements
for, and the limitations of, network server-based shared installations (that is,
SETUP /A and SETUP /N installations).

This article is intended to provide system administrators with some guidelines
for performing such installations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you set up a server-based shared installation of Windows for Workgroups
3.11, be aware of the following:

- In the Microsoft LAN Manager and Windows NT environment (or any network
  requiring the installation of the real-mode Windows for Workgroups 3.11
  redirector prior to accessing the server with the shared, SETUP /A,
  directory), Windows for Workgroups 3.11 nodes have client functionality
  only.

  NOTE: Because Novell NetWare requires its own real-mode redirector (giving the
  node access to the shared directory before loading Windows for Workgroups and
  its peer-to-peer network components), this limitation may not exist in
  integrated Windows for Workgroups 3.11/NetWare environments.

- When running SETUP /N to a workstation from a Novell server, the Windows for
  Workgroups Setup program requires that Novell's Windows support files exist
  in the shared directory on the server (that is, the directory created with
  SETUP /A). The following files need to be copied to the shared Windows
  directory prior to running SETUP /N:

  NETWARE.DRV
  NETWARE.HLP
  NWPOPUP.EXE
  VNETWARE.386
  VIPX.386

  NOTE: Other third-party networks may present the same restrictions; refer to
  your network product documentation or vendor for more information.

Novell NetWare is manufactured by Novell, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
