-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1e, 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With versions 2.1e, 3.0, 3.0a, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, when a
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS workstation user is removed from a global
group, the MS-DOS workstation user may still have access to any group folders
associated with that global group.

A global group is defined as a group created from the Mail Administrator program
(ADMIN.EXE) and is available in the postoffice address list (POL).

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the Administrator program does not modify the record
for the MS-DOS workstation user in the GRPMEM.GLB file to reflect that the user
is no longer part of the group(s).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 2.1e, 3.0, 3.0a, and
3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. This problem was corrected in version
3.2a (which includes ADMIN.EXE version 3.2.9).
