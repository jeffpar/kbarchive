SYMPTOMS
========

When you play a .WAV file on a Sound Blaster 2.0 sound card (or a compatible
card, such as Media Concepts), repeating sounds may occur.

CAUSE
=====

If the driver settings for the sound card are known to be correct but .WAV
sounds still repeat, the problem may be caused by a defective parallel port
card.

If the repeating sound occurs after the sound card has been used several times, a
defective parallel port card is a likely cause. With a defective parallel card,
the IRQ conflict arises because the interrupt lines are locked by the defective
card so that the controller cannot correctly receive interrupt signals from the
sound card. Other peripherals (such as serial ports) may be affected as well.
The defect shows as an inability to properly use devices that require interrupt
control (for example, modems) under Windows 3.1.

NOTE: The interrupt settings on the parallel port card do not have to be the same
as the Sound Blaster settings for this problem to occur. The defective parallel
port card may or may not affect Sound Blaster from an MS-DOS-based program.

The same repeating sound problem occurs when the sound card interrupt setting and
the interrupt chosen when setting up the sound card driver in Windows 3.1 are
not the same.
