SUMMARY
=======

The Clipboard is the main data-exchange feature of Microsoft Windows. It is a
common area for storing data handles through which applications can exchange
formatted data. The Clipboard can hold a number of different data formats and
corresponding data handles, all representing the same data, but in many
different formats.

For example, a pie chart might be held in the Clipboard as both a metafile
picture and a bitmap. An application receiving the pie chart from the Clipboard
would have to choose which representation matched its requirements. In general,
the format that provides the most information is the most desirable, as long as
the application understands that format.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows provides several predefined data formats for use in data interchange.
The following list describes the common formats:

  Format          Description
  ------          -----------

  BITMAP          Specifies a device-dependent bitmap

  DIB             Specifies a device-independent bitmap

  DIF             Specifies that the data is in the Software Arts'
                  data-interchange format (DIF)

  METAFILEPICT    Specifies a metafile-picture structure

  OEMTEXT         Specifies null-terminated text in the OEM
                  character set

  RIFF            Specifies that the data is in any resource
                  interchange file (RIFF) format.

  SYLK            Specifies that the data is in the Microsoft
                  symbolic link (SYLK) format.

  TEXT            Specifies null-terminated text

                  Windows supports two formats for text: TEXT and
                  OEMTEXT. TEXT is the default Windows Clipboard text
                  format. OEMTEXT is used by Windows for text within
                  non-Windows-based applications.

  TIFF            Specifies that the data is in the tag image file
                  format (TIFF).

  WAVE            Specifies that the data is a RIFF waveform file with
                  form type WAVE.

NOTE: Clipboard data objects can be any size. The size of memory allocated for
Clipboard usage is determined by the application copying to the Clipboard and
the application receiving data from the Clipboard. You may receive an
application error message if your application does not allocate sufficient
memory.
