SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the preferred method for installing the IBM Personal
Pageprinter Model 4216-020 with Microsoft Windows. Using this method
dramatically reduces the number of unrecoverable application errors (UAEs) and
general protection (GP) faults associated with the standard installation of the
adapter software required to run this printer.

IBM manufactures three different models of the IBM Personal Pageprinter: the
4216-020, 4216-030, and 4216-031. This information applies only to the model
4216-020 with version 1.3.1 of the Personal Pageprinter adapter software.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Pageprinter includes an adapter card installed in the computer and a
printing engine in the printer; these are connected by a cable. The card in the
computer provides a port called EPT. You must use this hardware to print with
the Pageprinter 4216-020.

When you start your computer, a line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file runs the Personal
Pageprinter Adapter Program (PPAP). The PPAP loads a PostScript interpreter into
the computer's adapter card. The most current version of the PPAP is 1.3.1. You
must use this version. The PPAP will not be revised again. IBM discontinued the
Pageprinter 4216-020 and no longer supports it.

When IBM discontinued the Pageprinter and stopped revising the PPAP, Windows
version 3.0 had not been released. Because the PPAP is designed for use with
Windows 2.x, using it with later versions of Windows can cause problems. The
steps below detail how to use the Pageprinter correctly with Windows versions
3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, and 3.11.

With Windows version 2.x, the PPAP software must be installed after Windows is
installed in order for certain files to be updated correctly. Using the
instructions below, the installation sequence is no longer as important;
however, it is recommended that you follow the installation order below. To
install PPAP correctly with Windows 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, and 3.11, do the following:

1. Remove old copies of Windows and the PPAP. If the PPAP was installed to use a
  working directory (for example, C:\PUBLISH), this directory also needs to be
  removed. Be sure to back up any publications that may be stored in the
  working directory.

2. Install Windows, then install the Windows PostScript printer driver through
  the Control Panel. Set up this printer choice as the "IBM Personal
  Pageprinter" (not "IBM Personal Pageprinter II-30" or "IBM Personal Page
  Printer II-31"). Configure this printer for the EPT port.

  NOTE: You must disable the Print Manager in Control Panel.

3. Follow the IBM instructions for installing the PPAP from the Pageprinter
  disks. The IBM installation program offers the following choices:

   - PPAP only

   - PPAP with Microsoft Windows and Windows applications

   - PPAP for Local Area Network print server

   - PPAP for Local Area Network workstation with Microsoft Windows

  Choose to install the PPAP only. Windows 2.x required the second choice;
  however, this choice corrupts the Windows 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, or 3.11 WIN.INI
  file.

  Follow the instructions as you are prompted to enter disks. You should be
  prompted for only disks that are labeled PPDISKx. With the 3.5-inch disk
  version of the PPAP, which is the most common format, you are prompted for
  PPDISK1 through PPDISK6.

  When the PPAP installation is finished, you should be able to reboot your
  system and print to the Pageprinter on the EPT port from Windows.

This sequence does not install the additional Windows screen fonts that are
provided with the Pageprinter. You can install these manually through the
Windows Control Panel. To do this, run Control Panel, choose the Fonts icon,
then choose the Add button. When prompted for a font filename, insert one of the
disks labeled "PPWSFXx" in the A drive and type A:\PSFONTS, then choose the OK
button. A list of fonts should appear. Choose the fonts you want to install. You
can do this for all the PPWSFx disks to add the screen fonts you need.
