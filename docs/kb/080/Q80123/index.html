The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft LINK for MS-DOS, versions 3.x, 4.x, 5.0x, 5.1x, 5.2, 5.3x, 5.5, 5.6 
- Microsoft LINK for OS/2, versions 5.0x, 5.1, 5.11, 5.13, 5.15

SUMMARY
=======

When the Microsoft LINK command line does not include the /NOE option and the
object modules contain more than one definition of a symbol, LINK generates the
following message:

  L2044 : 'symbol' : symbol multiply defined, use /NOE

The following additional information about this error appears in the
documentation:

  LINK found what it interprets as a public-symbol redefinition, probably
  because a symbol defined in a library was redefined.

  Relink with the /NOE option. If error L2025 results for the same symbol, then
  this is a genuine symbol-redefinition error.

LINK generates the L2044 error because it cannot determine if the redefinition
occurred through the use of the extended dictionary or if the symbol was
actually redefined. When the command line includes the /NOE option switch and
the symbol is redefined, a genuine redefinition error occurred and an L2025
error results.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Library utility (LIB) creates an extended dictionary when it
builds a library, unless the LIB command line includes the /NOE option switch.
The extended dictionary contains cross-references between the modules. For
example, if Mod1 and Mod2 are modules in a library and function A() in Mod1
calls function B() in Mod2. In this relationship, Mod1 is termed the "primary"
module and Mod2 is termed the "secondary" module.

  Mod1: Primary Module    Mod2: Secondary Module

    ______________          ______________
   |              |        |              |
   |   A( )       |        |   B( )       |
   |   {          |        |   {          |
   |      B( )    |        |              |
   |   }          |        |   }          |
   |______________|        |______________|

When an application required Mod1, most likely it will also require Mod2, because
a function in Mod1 relies on a function in Mod2.

LINK can use this information to speed the linking process. First, LINK finds all
symbols in the specified object modules and uses them to resolve any external
references. If any symbols remain unresolved, LINK searches the specified
libraries for these symbols and loads the modules that resolve the symbols.

For example, consider the process of linking a program that calls function A()
but does not include the code for A() with a library that contains Mod1 and Mod2
above. After searching in the object module, A() remains unresolved. When it
searches the library, LINK finds A() defined in Mod1 and loads that module. If
it uses the extended dictionary, LINK also loads Mod2, to automatically resolve
the call to B(). If LINK does not use the extended dictionary, LINK finds that
B() is an unresolved symbol and it must search the libraries once again.

In general, if an application requires many libraries, the process of resolving
the symbols in primary modules proceeds much faster when the secondary modules
are loaded with their corresponding primary modules.

The following example demonstrates how using the extended dictionary can cause a
symbol redefinition.

               Primary Modules       Secondary Modules
                ______________         ______________
               |              |       |              |
               |   X( )       |       |   Z( )       |
   Library1:   |   {          |       |   {          |
               |      Z( )    |       |              |
               |   }          |       |   }          |
               |______________|       |______________|

                ______________         ______________
               |              |       |              |
               |   Y( )       |       |   Z( )       |
   Library2:   |   {          |       |   {          |
               |      Z( )    |       |              |
               |   }          |       |   }          |
               |______________|       |______________|

Consider the process of linking an application that calls X() and Y() but does
not define Z() with Library1 and Library2. If LINK uses the extended dictionary,
LINK loads both secondary modules and causes a redefinition for Z(). However, if
LINK does not use the extended dictionary, LINK resolves Z() from the first
definition of Z() in its library search (LINK searches libraries in the order in
which they are specified on the command line). Therefore, specifying the /NOE
option eliminates this error.

Also, consider the process of linking an application that both calls and defines
Z() with Library1. If LINK uses the extended dictionary, it loads the secondary
module, which causes a redefinition of Z(). If LINK does not use the extended
dictionary, the Z() call in function X() is resolved with the version of Z()
defined in the application. Therefore, specifying the /NOE option eliminates
this error.
