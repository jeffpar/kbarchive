SUMMARY
=======

Application Compatibility Document for Windows 3.1
--------------------------------------------------

Due to the amount of information in this document, it has been broken into seven
pieces. To find all seven pieces of this document and the Windows 3.1
Compatibility Test checklist, query this knowledge base on the words:

  " prod(winsdk) and 31compattest " (without the quotation marks)

PARAMETER VALIDATION
--------------------

Windows strictly checks parameters passed to its functions before using them. In
a Windows version 3.0 application, Windows works around many validation errors
and lets the function or application continue to function. In a Windows version
3.1 application, many of these errors cause the functions to fail, and the
developer must ensure that structures and parameters are passed correctly.

For example, in Windows version 3.0, if an application passes NULL as the
hInstance parameter to CreateWindowEx, Windows maps the handle to the stack
segment. In Windows version 3.1, the function returns an error value.

The SDK release notes describe this in more detail. In some cases, the system may
reject valid parameters incorrectly and cause applications to misbehave.
Microsoft plans to correct any such occurrences.

UNDELETED OBJECT NOTIFICATIONS
------------------------------

In Windows version 3.1, any GDI or USER object left allocated when an application
terminates results in a warning to the debug terminal. Windows version 3.1 does
not automatically free these objects; the application must free them. These
warnings usually imply a memory leakage; running and terminating an offending
application eventually uses up all available memory.

In some cases applications (and DLLs) allocate objects that are intended to stay
around longer than the application that created them. This occurs frequently in
shared DLLs that share GDI objects such as bitmaps and brushes among their many
clients. In such cases, ignore the warnings at the debug terminal.

Potential Problem
-----------------

Applications can eventually use up available memory, which seriously degrades
system performance.

Test
----

Use the Program Manager to check memory usage before and after running your
application. Follow these steps:

1. Choose the About command in Program Manager's Help menu. Record the amount of
  available memory and resources.

2. Run your application and carry out enough tasks to ensure that one or more
  objects are created. Terminate your application.

3. Choose the About command again and compare available memory and resources. Be
  sure these values have not dropped.

4. Repeat this procedure several times, and check available memory and resources
  each time.

MENU IMPLEMENTATION
-------------------

Windows version 3.1 has enhanced menu management. In particular, the
TrackPopupMenu function allows additional parameters, and Windows stores
application menu data in a separate heap, expanding the number of windows that
may exist.

In Windows version 3.0 applications, Windows sends a WM_COMMAND message using the
SendMessage function. In Windows version 3.1 applications, Windows sends the
message using the PostMessage function, preventing the potential for overflowing
a stack when dealing with pop-up menus.

REGISTERCLASS
-------------

In Windows version 3.0, Windows fails to free the window-class background brush
properly when deleting the class. In Windows version 3.1, Windows frees the
brush when either a Windows version 3.0 or 3.1 application terminates.

Potential Problem
-----------------

A multiple-instance application that deletes the background brush may
unintentionally delete a brush when other instances of the application are
running.

TOPMOST WINDOW
--------------

A new window attribute allows a window to be placed on top of all other windows,
even when the owning application is not active. If multiple applications have
topmost windows, the topmost window is ordered the same as owning applications.

Also, a topmost window, its owners, and all windows it owns stay together as
windows are moved around. Thus, if you bring an owned dialog window to the top,
its owner is also brought forward so that it stays immediately below the dialog
box.

Potential Problem
-----------------

Applications that depend on being able to have windows of other applications
between their main window and a dialog box may encounter problems. For example,
a Setup program that starts Notepad and then brings up a dialog box causes
Notepad to be positioned behind the dialog box owner. The solution is to create
the dialog box without an owner (a window may not be owned by a window of
another application).

Potential Problem
-----------------

Any application that relies on having an unobstructed client area when active may
encounter problems because the active window cannot be guaranteed to be on top.
Thus, the active window may not have a rectangular clipping region because a
topmost window may be on top of it. Calling BitBlt with a window or screen DC as
the source (which is not recommended in any case) may copy bits belonging to the
topmost window.

Tests
-----

1. Examine your application code, and be sure there are no dependencies on
  client area visibility when your application is active.

2. Start the clock, and set it to be the topmost window. Run your application
  and several others. Use ALT+TAB to switch between applications, and be sure
  your application repaints correctly.
