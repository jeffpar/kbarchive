-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An application is unable to load some of its resources, while other resources
load properly.

CAUSE
=====

Several small compiled resource (RES) files have been combined using the MS-DOS
command "COPY /b".

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the #include directive to combine the files at the source level.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Resource Compiler that was shipped with the Microsoft Windows Software
Development Kit (SDK) versions 2.x ca not handle large resource files because of
inherent memory limitations. To work around these limitations, it is recommended
that programmers compile the resources into small RES files, and combine these
files using the MS-DOS COPY /b command.

The Resource Compiler shipped with version 3.x of the Windows SDK has been
enhanced to handle resource files much larger than its Windows 2.x counterpart.
The format of the compiled resource files in Windows 3.x does not support
concatenation of RES files.

If an application has a large number of resources, even the version 3.x Resource
Compiler can run out of memory. If this occurs, modify the design of the
application to use a resource-only dynamic-link library (DLL). The following
three steps outline the required process to perform this type of functionality:

1. Use the Resource Compiler to create a resource-only DLL that contains some of
  the application's resources. See the note below regarding resource-only DLLs
  under Windows 3.x.

2. In the application, load the resource library using the LoadLibrary function.

3. Use the LoadBitmap, LoadMenu, and so forth, functions to load resources from
  the DLL as required.

Under Windows 3.x, resource-only DLLs require a Windows exit procedure (WEP). The
WEP must be exported in the DEF file and the export must have the RESIDENTNAME
attribute. Place the code for the WEP into a FIXED code segment. The source code
for a WEP follows:

     int far pascal WEP(int NotUsed)
        {
        return 1;
        }

The "far" and "pascal" declarators are in lowercase to avoid having to include
the WINDOWS.H header file.
