SUMMARY
=======

In some cases, it is useful to change the accelerator keys that are assigned to
menu items in an application. Chgaccl.exe is a sample in the Microsoft Download
Center that demonstrates how to change the accelerators by loading a different
accelerator table from the RC file and modifying the text of menu items.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following files are available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  Chgaccl.exe

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

Chgaccl.exe has two accelerator tables defined in the .RC file and a menu item
that allows the user to "swap" accelerator tables. When the user chooses to swap
the accelerators, the application loads the second accelerator table and
modifies the menu to reflect the changes in the accelerators. The user can swap
back to the original accelerator table by choosing swap accelerators from the
menu a second time.

Dynaccel.exe is a second sample in the Microsoft Download Center that
demonstrates how to build an accelerator table as part of an application. For
additional information about Dynaccel.exe, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q75738 SAMPLE: Dynaccel.exe Creates Accelerator Tables Dynamically

NOTE: Two (or more) instances of the application can be running, using different
accelerators for each instance.

Chgaccl.exe also uses specific GDI functions to properly draw shapes in the
client area of the window. Each time the user chooses a new shape from the menu,
the client area device context is reset to properly define the window's
background color, pen color, mapping mode, and compression factors.
