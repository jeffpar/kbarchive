SUMMARY
=======

In an application designed with the Microsoft Windows Multiple Document
Interface (MDI), there are situations in which it is desirable to destroy an MDI
child window during the processing of its WM_CREATE message. For example, the
design of the application may require terminating window creation if a memory
allocation needed to hold data for an MDI child fails.

Unfortunately, returning -1 to end processing of the WM_CREATE message will not
cleanly destroy the child window. Similarly, posting a WM_CLOSE message will
cause the display to flash as the child is drawn, made active, and destroyed.
This article describes a technique to avoid this unacceptable visual effect.

To avoid the flash, the application can clear the redraw flag for the MDI client
window. This prevents the MDI client window and its children from painting. The
remainder of this article contains code to implement this technique.

Before the application processes the MDI child window's WM_CREATE message, it
does not change its display to reflect the new child window. If the application
determines that it must abort creating the MDI child window at this time, it
should clear the MDI client window's redraw flag and post a WM_CLOSE message to
the child window. When the application processes the WM_DESTROY message, turn
the redraw flag back on. The following code demonstrates these steps:

     case WM_CREATE:

      ...

         if (DestroyMePolitely)
             {
             SendMessage(hWndMDIClient, WM_SETREDRAW, FALSE, 0L);
             PostMessage(hWnd, WM_CLOSE, 0, 0L);
             }
         break;

     ...

     case WM_DESTROY:
         SendMessage(hWndMDIClient, WM_SETREDRAW, TRUE, 0L);
