-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.1, 3.2, 3.21, 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
- Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========


When you start your computer, you may receive one of the following error
messages:

- Missing Operating System

- Non-system disk or disk error

- Boot error Press F1 to retry

- NO ROM BASIC

- Invalid Media Type

- Hard Drive Controller Failure

CAUSE
=====

Missing Operating System
------------------------

This error occurs when the boot record signature of the master boot record does
not match a certain value at a certain location. In this case, the boot sector
is invalid and the computer cannot boot. This error can also occur if there is
no active partition defined in the partition table.

Non-System Disk or Disk Error
-----------------------------

This error is generated by the computer's BIOS when the boot sector or master
boot record of the boot drive is damaged or missing. This error can also occur
if the boot device has been improperly configured in the BIOS. In this case,
data in the partition may be valid and undamaged, but there is no bootable
partition.

NOTE: This message also occurs when a non-bootable disk is left in drive A during
startup. If you receive this error, make sure that there is no disk in drive A
and restart your computer.

Boot Error Press F1 to Retry
----------------------------

This error is generated by the computer's BIOS when the hard disk is missing a
master boot record or boot sector, or when there is a problem accessing the boot
drive.

NO ROM BASIC
------------

If there is no active partition defined, the master boot record returns an error
to the BIOS. In some cases, the master boot code attempts to go to ROM Basic
when no bootable disk is found. Since some computers do not have ROM Basic, they
display a NO ROM BASIC or other error message. The message displayed is
dependent upon the computer's BIOS.

Invalid Media Type
------------------

This error message is displayed when the boot sector of a defined partition is
damaged. The error message is normally received using a new partition that has
not been formatted. However, if the boot sector is damaged, the partition may
appear unformatted to the operating system, and this error message is
generated.

Hard Disk Controller Failure
----------------------------

This error message indicates either the hard disk controller has failed, the hard
disk controller is not set up properly in the BIOS, or the controller cannot
communicate with the attached drive(s). In this case, do not perform the
troubleshooting steps below. Instead, consult the documentation included with
your computer or contact the computer's manufacturer for more information.

RESOLUTION
==========

Each of the error messages listed above may indicate problems ranging from
improper hardware configuration to damaged hard disk partition information. The
following steps can be used to help resolve the problem. However, if these steps
do not resolve the problem, please contact your hardware manufacturer or have
the drive serviced by a qualified service professional.

1. Start the computer using the Windows 95 emergency boot disk (EBD) or using a
  bootable MS-DOS disk that contains Fdisk.exe, Format.com, Sys.com, and
  Scandisk.exe (MS-DOS versions 6.2x only).

  If your computer does not start from drive A, or if you receive an error
  message similar to one listed above when you start from drive A, please
  contact the computer's manufacturer.

2. Use Fdisk.exe to view the partitions on the hard disk by performing the
  following steps:

  a. Run Fdisk.exe from the EBD or bootable MS-DOS disk.

     NOTE: If the hard disk was not partitioned using Fdisk.exe, use the
     appropriate third-party partitioning software to view the hard disk
     partition(s). For instructions on using the third-party partitioning
     software, please consult the software's documentation.

  b. Select option 4 (Display partition information).

  c. If the partitions are listed, make sure that the bootable partition is
     defined as active (look for an uppercase A in the Status column.)

  d. If there are no partitions listed, use Fdisk.exe to establish new
     partitions and then use Format.com to format the partition you want to
     boot from.

     WARNING: When you use Fdisk.exe or Format.com to create new partitions or
     format the drive, you lose any data on that drive or partition.

  e. If all the partitions appear in Fdisk.exe, and one is defined as active,
     proceed to the next step.

3. Run the SYS command on the hard disk from the EBD or bootable MS-DOS disk.
  For example, type the following command:

  " a:\sys c:" (without the quotation marks)

  If you receive the message "System Transferred," remove the disk from drive A
  and restart the computer. If you receive the same error message after you
  restart your computer, your hard disk may be configured improperly or
  damaged.

  If you do not receive the "System Transferred" message, or if you receive an
  error message, run ScanDisk from the EBD or bootable MS-DOS disk (MS-DOS
  version 6.20 or later) to check for physical damage on the hard disk by
  typing the following command:

  " a:\scandisk c:" (without the quotation marks)

  If you are prompted to perform a surface scan, choose Yes. If ScanDisk reports
  physical damage on the hard disk, have the hard disk checked by a qualified
  service professional.
