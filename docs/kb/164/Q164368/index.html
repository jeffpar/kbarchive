SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Windows after removing Protect It!, you may continue to receive a
login screen where you had previously gone directly to the Windows desktop.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do the following to disable the login screen:

1. Restart the computer and at the Windows login screen click Cancel.

2. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

3. Double-click Passwords.

4. On the User Profiles tab, click "All users of this PC use the same
  preferences and desktop", and then click OK.

5. Restart the computer when you are prompted to.

If the login screen still appears, do the following:

Warning: If you are on a network, performing the following steps will disable
your ability to log on to the network through Windows. Check with your Network
Administrator prior to performing these steps.

1. Restart the computer and at the Windows login screen click Cancel.

2. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

3. Double-click Network.

4. Remove any client network components, such as Client for Microsoft Networks
  or Client for NetWare Networks, and then click OK.

5. Restart the computer when you are prompted to.

NOTE: For more information about performing these tasks in Windows, please refer
to your Windows printed documentation or online Help.

You should no longer receive the login screen when you start Windows.

For more information about removing User Profiles, please see the following
article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q156826 How to Disable and Delete User Profiles


NOTE: If your computer is not set up for multiple user profiles, when you run
Protect It! for the first time you will receive the following message:

  In order for your computer to recognize multiple family members, Protect It!
  has changed the login process for your system. Protect It! needs to restart
  Windows so that these changes take effect before you can set any Protect It!
  options.

  Restart Windows Now?

This message means that the ability for Windows to keep separate profiles for
each user that logs on to your computer has been added. This setting is
available on the User Profiles tab in Password Properties located in the Windows
Control Panel as the "Users can customize their preferences and desktop
settings. Windows switches to your personal settings whenever you log in"
option.
