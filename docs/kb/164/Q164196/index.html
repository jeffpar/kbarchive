The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Plus! for Kids, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use desktop themes in Microsoft Plus! For Kids, the system icons (My
Computer, Network Neighborhood, and Recycle Bin) will not change when a new user
logs on. The default custom icons for the selected desktop theme will not change
to the new user's preferred icons.

WORKAROUND
==========

The following is a workaround for the problem:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Passwords icon.

3. Click the User Profiles tab, verify that the "Include Start menu and program
  groups in user settings" check box is selected. If the check box is not
  selected, click to select it.

4. Click OK or Close until you return to the Control Panel.

5. Click the Start button, and then click Windows Explorer.

6. From the View menu, click Options.

7. On the File Types tab, select Desktop Theme File from the Registered File
  Types list box, and then click Edit.

8. In the Actions list box, select Apply Settings, and then click the Set
  Default button.

9. Click Close two times to return to Windows Explorer.

10. Create a personal theme:
  a. Click the Start button, point to Programs, Microsoft Kids, and then click
     Desktop Themes.

  b. Apply the theme that you want.

  c. Click the Save As button, type a name for your Theme in the File Name box,
     and then click Save.

  NOTE: You may need to click OK to close the dialog box, and then restart the
  Desktop Themes applet to access the Save As button. The Theme selection
  should read, "Current Windows settings".

11. Return to Windows Explorer and open the Microsoft Plus! For Kids folder. The
  default themes folder is: \Program Files\Microsoft Kids\Plus! For
  Kids\Themes

12. Click once to select your newly created theme (.theme) file, and then from
  the Edit menu click Copy.

13. Open the \Windows\Profiles\&lt;user name&gt;\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
  folder.

14. Click once to select the Startup folder, and then from the Edit menu click
  Paste Shortcut.

For more information about performing these tasks in Windows, please see your
Windows printed documentation or online Help.

NOTE: This workaround may not work in conjunction with Protect It!, if Protect
It! restrictions disable the Startup group.

Each time you log on, your personal theme will be applied. Any changes you make
during your Windows session will be saved, and they will be in effect the next
time you log on to your computer.

NOTE: If you choose to use a default Windows theme, or create a new personal
theme, the changes you make will not be in effect the next time you log on.
Windows will use the theme you placed in the Startup folder until you remove or
replace it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Desktop icon registry entries are located in the Windows System.dat file, and
the current user's icons are maintained by entries in the Windows User.dat file,
located in the \Windows\Profiles\&lt;user name&gt; folder. Because the desktop
icons are not stored as user-specific icons in the User.dat file, they are not
changed when a new user logs on.
