SUMMARY
=======

Users who are migrated to Exchange from Microsoft Mail postoffices may not
receive messages in their Exchange Inbox. This occurs when Microsoft Mail users
are addressing from any address list that is not updated by directory
synchronization (dirsync). This also occurs if Exchange users are addressing the
migrated user from a personal address book that has not been updated from the
Exchange global address list since the Microsoft Mail user was migrated.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If Microsoft Mail users have been participating in dirsync and then are migrated
into Exchange, the users will receive two Microsoft Mail-type addresses on their
e-mail address tab. One Microsoft Mail address is their new Exchange
Network/Postoffice/Alias address, and the other is their former
Network/Postoffice/Alias address. The former address is to allow other Microsoft
Mail users to continue sending to the migrated users using their old
Network/Postoffice/Alias name. If the Exchange Microsoft Mail Connector contains
a definition for the migrated Network/Postoffice name, the connector will
reroute the message to the former postoffice. The Microsoft Mail Connector will
not forward the message into Exchange to determine whether the address is in
Exchange. If the Microsoft Mail Connector no longer has the former postoffice's
Network/Postoffice definitions, then the Microsoft Mail Connector will forward
the messages into Exchange. Microsoft Mail users can continue to address from
any address list without being updated.

This problem is similar to moving one user to another postoffice. If the global
address lists and personal address books from the sending postoffices still have
that user listed as existing on the old postoffice, the messages will be routed
to that postoffice and then NDRed (non-delivery reported).

Microsoft recommends that migrations of entire postoffices be performed rather
than migrations of individual users.

This behavior is by product design.
