SYMPTOMS
========

On an IIS 3.0 server with the Server Gated Cryptography (SGC) Schannel.dll
update and a valid SGC certificate installed, SGC-enabled clients either cannot
connect at 128-bit strength or they cannot connect at all.

Specifically, Internet Explorer 3.02 with the SGC update installed only connects
using a 40-bit key strength, while Internet Explorer 4.0 clients cannot connect
at all, and get the following error:

  Internet Explorer cannot open the Internet site http://www.xxxxxxx.yyy.
  The supplied certificate is invalid.

Netscape Communicator 4.0x always makes the encryption with a 40-bit key instead
of a 128-bit key.

CAUSE
=====

The name on the SGC certificate does not match the name of the server on which
the certificate is installed. SGC certificates have the name of the machine on
which they should be installed embedded in the certificate. If the name in the
SGC certificate does not match the name of the server, the SGC clients are not
able to negotiate 128-bit encryption and may completely fail any connect
attempt.

RESOLUTION
==========

Obtain an SGC certificate for your server that was generated for your machine
name. Or you can rename your server to match the name on the certificate.

MORE INFORMATION
================
