SYMPTOMS
========

During setup of Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 (enterprise or standard), the
process may terminate unexpectedly with an access violation (Dr. Watson). The
Drwtsn32.log will look similar to the following:

  Application exception occurred:
     App: srvrmax.dbg (pid=161)
     When: 3/7/1997 @ 13:21:20.829
     Exception number: c0000005 (access violation)

  function: &lt;nosymbols&gt;

  *----&gt; Stack Back Trace &lt;----*

  FramePtr ReturnAd Param#1  Param#2  Param#3  Param#4  Function Name
  0012de3c 00000000 004c004e 00000059 00000000 0012de5c &lt;nosymbols&gt;
  0012ffc0 77f1b26b 00000208 00000000 7ffdf000 c0000005
srvrmax!&lt;nosymbols&gt;
  0012fff0 00000000 00460af0 00000000 00000000 77fa5aa0
  kernel32!BaseProcessStart (FPO: Non-FPO [1,8,3])
  00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
srvrmax!&lt;nosymbols&gt;

NOTE: The &lt;no symbols&gt; appears because the RTL build does not have symbols
for Srvrmax.exe. This is how Drwtsn32.log will look even with Windows NT and
Microsoft Exchange symbols installed. Srvrmax.exe is really Setup.exe on an
enterprise installation; Srvrmin.exe is Setup.exe on a standard installation.

CAUSE
=====

The allocated buffer to hold the length of the domain's PDC name is too small. A
primary domain controller (PDC) computer name with a length of 14 characters or
more will overrun the buffer and corrupt the stack, causing heap corruption and
the access violation.




RESOLUTION
==========

The buffer to hold the domain's PDC name was increased by two characters.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server
5.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

  S E R V P A C K


MORE INFORMATION
================

Build 1457.10 was the original release-to-manufacturing version of Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.0. As soon as this issue was detected, the product was
recalled and Microsoft issued Build 1457.11 as the current release to
manufacturing revision of the product.

Customers impacted by this issue include only those that have obtained Build
1457.10 through "non-channel" means. This build was only briefly available as a
download from the http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/ site and could have been
obtained through Microsoft's own internal servers.
