INSTRUCTIONS FOR DECOMPRESSING FILES
------------------------------------

All of the above files are compressed in self-extracting archive format,
containing SNA Server 2.11 SP2. To extract each file, copy the file to a
separate empty directory on your hard drive and run the file using the "-d"
option. For example:

211sp2is.exe -d &lt;PATH&gt;

where &lt;PATH&gt; is the destination directory for the service pack. If you wish
to extract the service pack to the current directory, leave &lt;PATH&gt; blank.

After the service pack file has been decompressed, run the Update.exe program to
install the updated SNA Server 2.11 server or client files, as appropriate.

NOTE: The Update program will automatically stop any SNA Server services that may
be running.

INSTALLING SNA 2.11 SERVICE PACK 2
----------------------------------

** TO BE APPLIED TO SNA SERVER 2.11 or 2.11 SP1 ONLY!! **

Both the SNA Server and SNA client files have been updated in 2.11 SP2. Updates
may be applied in any order---to the server and/or to the clients. It is
recommended that all systems running SNA Server 2.11 (that is, SNA Servers and
client computers) are updated to SP2. It may not be necessary to update the
client computers to SP2 unless you are experiencing a client problem that has
been fixed in SP2.
