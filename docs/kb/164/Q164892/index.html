IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

A computer running Microsoft SNA Server that is configured to use only TCP/IP as
the protocol for Server Broadcasts may not resume sending these broadcasts after
a network outage. If the SNA Server computer stops sending/receiving broadcasts,
the SNA Server Manager will not display an accurate status for SNA resources in
the subdomain.


CAUSE
=====

When using TCP/IP, SNA Server 3.0 systems keep track of the other SNA Servers in
the subdomain by adding them to the following registry entry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
     \SYSTEM
        \CurrentControlSet
           \Services
              \SnaBase
                 \Parameters
                    \SnaTcp
                       \LocalHosts:
                          &lt;snaserver1&gt;:REG_MULTI_SZ: &lt;ip address&gt;
                             &lt;snaserver2&gt;:REG_MULTI_SZ: &lt;ip address&gt;

LocalHosts will contain a list of all the SNA servers in the subdomain.

This problem occurs because SnaBase was removing the names in the LocalHosts
registry entry during a network outage that lasted longer than SnaBase's timeout
of five minutes. SnaBase did not resume the server broadcasts because there were
no server names in the list for it to send the broadcasts to.

A computer running SNA Server that is listed in the LocalHosts registry entry
should be removed only if that SNA Server is stopped. They should not be removed
because of a timeout condition such as a network outage.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

A workaround exists by adding the following registry entry

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
     \SYSTEM
        \CurrentControlSet
           \Services
              \SnaBase
                 \Parameters
                    \PermanentServers: REG_MULTI_SZ: &lt;list&gt;

where the entries in the &lt;list&gt; are the SNA Server Names and/or IP
addresses listed on separate lines in the registry editor Multi-String Editor
Data field. SnaBase will always send service table updates to the SNA Servers
listed under this registry entry even if they are not in the SNA Server
configuration file.

The SnaBase service has been updated to prevent servers from being removed from
the LocalHosts list due to a timeout condition.

The following module has been updated:

  \&lt;snaroot&gt;\System\Snabase.exe

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
