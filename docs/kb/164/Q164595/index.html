-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a computer running Windows NT 4.0 is connected through a router to another
device on a remote network, and that router exchanges multiple ICMP REDIRECT
messages with another router (which provides a new path for the computer running
Windows NT to get the remote device), the route table on the computer running
Windows 4.0 may grow unnecessarily.


CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by a problem with TCP/IP in Windows NT 4.0: TCP/IP would
add the information about the new path to the route table, but did not delete
the previous route, causing the route table to grow unnecessarily.

RESOLUTION
==========

A new version of Tcpip.sys is available that corrects this problem and deletes
unnecessary routes that are updated by redirect messages received from the
router.

To resolve this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in
