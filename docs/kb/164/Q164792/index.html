-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
- the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT, versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using SNA Server 3.0 on Windows NT Server 3.51 or 4.0, the CPU use may
reach 100 percent and stay at this value indefinitely. This problem has only
been observed by using SNA Server 3.0's print server, where the local print
processor is not spooling data in a RAW format to a destination print server.
You can observe this CPU use by going into Performance Monitor and looking at
the following counters:

  Object: Processor
  Instance: 0
  Counter: % Processor Time

  Object: Process
  Instance: snaprint
  Counter: % Processor Time

You will see the first counter at 100 percent and the second counter between 97
to 100 percent indefinitely.

CAUSE
=====

The cause of this problem is currently being investigated.


WORKAROUND
==========

You can use a workaround until a fix can be made to the Windows NT Server print
subsystem. The workaround is to make sure that the print job from SNA Server is
spooled as a RAW datatype to the destination print server. You can accomplish
this by doing either of the following:

- On a Windows NT Server 4.0 client (where SNA Server is running), go into the
  Properties for the defined printer. Click the Print Processor button and
  check the "Always spool RAW datatype" check box. By default, this option is
  not checked.

- On a Windows NT Server 3.51 client (where SNA Server is running), select the
  printer in Print Manager, click Properties on the Printer menu, and click
  Details. The default datatype needs to be RAW. By default under Windows NT
  Server 3.51, the default datatype is RAW.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server 3.51 and 4.0
and SNA Server 3.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA
Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack,
