SUMMARY
=======

The ability to separate a reply address from an e-mail address is an enhancement
to Microsoft Exchange. As originally released, changes to the reply address
would also change the e-mail address. With this enhancement, the reply address
can be set independently from the e-mail address.

STATUS
======

This enhancement is included in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a custom recipient is created in Microsoft Exchange, the recipient is
considered to have one e-mail address that Microsoft Exchange will pass mail to.
This is also referred to as the target address for the recipient. This e-mail
address appears on the General property sheet when looking at the properties of
the custom recipient.

Microsoft Exchange supports creating additional addresses for recipients. This is
done through the E-mail Addresses tab when you view the details of a recipient.
This functionality gives Microsoft Exchange the ability to deliver mail to a
user who has multiple addresses.

The Microsoft Exchange Administrator program also allows a user to send mail with
a reply address that differs from the e-mail address that Microsoft Exchange
uses to deliver mail to this recipient. This address is selectable when there is
more than one e-mail address of a single type. The "Set as Reply Address" button
is used for this purpose.

For additional information about fixes related to the use of multiple e-mail
addresses and the target e-mail address, please see the following articles in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152501 XADM: Problem When Creating Multiple SMTP Proxy Addresses

  Q157007 XADM: Secondary Proxy Address Replaces Target Address of CR

NOTE: When this update has been used to modify a custom recipient, it is not
advisable to use an older version of Microsoft Exchange Administrator to make
changes to the same recipient addresses. The following message box may result:

  Microsoft Exchange Administrator
  An internal processing error has occurred:
  The attribute or value exists.
  Try restarting the Administrator program or
  the Microsoft Exchange Server computer, or both.

  Microsoft Exchange Directory
  ID no: DS_E_ATTRIBUTE_OR_VALUE_EXISTS
