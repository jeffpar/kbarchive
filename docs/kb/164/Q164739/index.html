-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The "Invalid coordinates" error message is received when sending @..SAYs to a
text file when the coordinates for the @..SAY reach a certain number. The
certain number is dependent on the FontSize property of _SCREEN. The smaller the
_SCREEN.FontSize, the larger the coordinate values can be.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following code can be used as a workaround to this problem, depending on the
circumstances:

  SET ALTERNATE TO test.txt
  SET ALTERNATE ON
  SET CONSOLE OFF

  FOR i=1 TO 35000
  ? "Row "+STR(i)
  ENDFOR

  SET ALTERNATE OFF
  SET ALTERNATE TO
  SET CONSOLE ON 

The code above uses the ? command instead of @...SAY's to output. The ? command
is placed inside a FOR...ENDFOR loop for illustration purposes. In an actual
application, the FOR...ENDFOR loop would likely be replaced with what actually
needs to be output to the text file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The "Invalid coordinates" error message is error number 1959. The Help file
states that the coordinate values must be between -32768 and 32767. Visual
FoxPro 3.x for Windows and Macintosh, and FoxPro for Windows can use coordinates
within the range specified by the Help file without error.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Enter the following commands in the Visual FoxPro Command window:

        SET DEVICE TO PRINTER
        SET PRINTER TO test.txt
        @ 32700,1 SAY "Hello"     &amp;&amp; This line will cause the error
        SET PRINTER TO
        SET DEVICE TO SCREEN

Although these few lines of code are all that is needed to reproduce the error,
it may be useful to find out what the maximum coordinate can be in a particular
situation. Continue with the next few steps to determine the maximum coordinate
that can be used.
2. Place the following code in a new program file and save it:

     IF FILE("test.txt")
          DELETE FILE "test.txt"
     ENDIF

     _SCREEN.FONTNAME="Arial"
     _SCREEN.FONTSIZE=10

     SET DEVICE TO PRINTER
     SET PRINTER TO test.txt
     FOR i=1 TO 32770
     @ i, 1 SAY "Hello "+ STR(i)
     ENDFOR

     SET PRINTER TO
     SET DEVICE TO SCREEN
     MODIFY FILE test.txt

3. Run the program. Because you should get the "Invalid coordinates" error,
  cancel the program when the error dialog box comes up.

4. Finish out the program by entering the following commands in the Visual
  FoxPro Command window:

  SET PRINTER TO SET DEVICE TO SCREEN MODIFY FILE test.txt

5. If the text file is not at the bottom, scroll down until the end is reached.
  The maximum coordinate should be listed. With _SCREEN.FontSize set to 10, the
  maximum coordinate should be about 2,047. If the _SCREEN.FontSize is set to
  4, the maximum coordinate should be about 5,461. _SCREEN.FontSize won't
  accept sizes less than 4 point. The program code in step 2 above has a
  command for changing the FontSize property of _SCREEN.
