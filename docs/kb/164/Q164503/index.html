The Microsoft Office 97 Resource Kit
------------------------------------

If you're an administrator or an IS professional, this book was written for you.
Here you'll find the hands-on, in-depth information you need to roll out,
support, and troubleshoot Microsoft Office 97. For systems running Microsoft
Windows 95 and Microsoft Windows NT (3.51 and 4.0), this is the professional's
guide to Microsoft Office 97. Here's hands-on information about updating from
earlier versions of Microsoft Office, about switching from other applications
such as Lotus 1-2-3 and WordPerfect, and about coexistence among different
versions of Microsoft Office. Of course, you get full information on network
installation, plus the timesaving Network Installation Wizard on the enclosed
CD-ROM. And like all the tools and utilities on the CD-ROM, this wizard is a
tested, supported application designed to make your job easier.
