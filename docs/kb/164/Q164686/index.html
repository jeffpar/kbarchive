The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Microsoft Word 97 for Windows on a system that had Xerox
Textbridge Pro96 and an earlier version of Word installed on it, OCR text
scanning and Word proofreading functionality will no longer be available in
Word.

Note: Instant Access OCR (OCR Textbridge) and Microsoft Word Proofreader menu
commands are not available in Word 97.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use Xerox Textbridge software to scan your files, and then save your files in a
Microsoft Word 6.0 or Word 7.0 format. Open these files in Word 97.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Xerox has released a Technical Information Bulletin (TIB#245) relating to the
compatibility of TextBridge Pro96 with Microsoft Word 97 for Windows. The
following is an excerpt from their Web site:

  TextBridge Pro96 can create files that are FULLY COMPATIBLE with this
  new version of Microsoft Word 97. You simply must run TextBridge Pro96
  by itself (outside of MS Word) and save your files in a MS Word 6.0
  or 7.0 format.

  Two features of TextBridge Pro96, Instant Access OCR and the Microsoft
  Word Proofreader, are NOT compatible with this new version of Microsoft
  Word.

  Ensuring product compatibility and customer satisfaction are important
  to Xerox. To support our customers we will release a free solution for
  the Instant Access OCR problem. This will be downloadable from our web
  site within the next two months. In place of the Proofreader we suggest
  you use the TextBridge Training tool and/or the MS Word spellchecker to
  proofread your scanned documents.

  If you would like to be automatically notified via email requesting
  notification of the availability of the MS Office 97/Instant Access OCR
  solution, send an email with the subject "TIB245 Request for
  Notification" to tib245@xis.xerox.com. This specific email address is
  for MSOffice97 compatibility notification only. If you need to send an
  email that needs a response, please visit either the Customer Support
  or Sales specific sections of www.textbridge.com.

Internet location:
