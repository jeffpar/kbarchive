-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you running the Microsoft Exchange Server Setup program on a Windows NT
Workstation computer or Windows NT Server computer, the following error message
may appear:

  The application failed to initialize properly (0xc0000005). Click OK
  to terminate the application.

This error message occurs at the beginning of Setup and causes Setup to
terminate.

CAUSE
=====

This error will occur if you have installed QuarterDeck CleanSweep v3.0 or v3.01
on your computer.

WORKAROUND
==========

In order to install Microsoft Exchange Server onto a computer that has
CleanSweep installed, you must do one of the following:

- Uninstall CleanSweep

  You can install Exchange Server successfully after you remove the CleanSweep
  software from your computer. Use the CleanSweep Setup Program to remove the
  software and then restart the computer. After Exchange Server is installed,
  CleanSweep can be reinstalled.

  NOTE: When you remove CleanSweep from the computer, you will also remove all
  of the installation logs from other software programs.

- Temporarily Disable CleanSweep

  To temporarily disable the QuarterDeck CleanSweep program:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe or Regedit.exe, as appropriate for your
  version of Windows NT).

2. Go to the following key in the registry:

     HKEY_LOCAL_\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\Current Version\Windows

3. Double-click on the AppInit_DLLS value and delete the data value of APITRAP,
  leaving the data field blank.

4. Exit Registry Editor and restart the computer.

5. After installing Microsoft Exchange Server, you can re-enable CleanSweep by
  changing the data value of the Registry entry above back to "APITRAP"
  (without quotes) and restarting the server.
