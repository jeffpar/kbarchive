SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the permissions to set on directories and files for an
FTP GET and an FTP PUT commands. The following has been tested on Microsoft
Windows NT Server version 4.0 and Internet Information Server (IIS) version 2.0
and works only on NTFS partitions. The following uses the anonymous user with
the default IUSER_hostname account created by IIS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For an anonymous user to GET any files from your FTP server the minimum
permission required is READ on the directory and all the subdirectories and
files below the directory. Without this permission the anonymous user will not
be able to GET a file even if he or she knows the name of the file. The user has
to be able to browse through the directories to GET the file he or she would
need.

The following steps lists how to set these permissions:

1. Click the NTFS drive.

2. Select the folder you want to set the permissions on.

3. Right click the folder, and click Properties.

4. Click the Security tab and in the Permissions box, click Permissions.

5. Select Special Directory Access and Special File Access from the drop down
  box Type of Access, and select the type of access you want to set by
  selecting Other and checking all options that apply.

6. Select Read as one of your options. This is required.

  For users to PUT files into directories or subdirectories they do not need
  Read permission on them. In other words they do not have to browse the
  directory to PUT files into it. The permission they would need is Write and
  if they know the name of the directory to PUT files into they can do it
  successfully without the READ permission.
