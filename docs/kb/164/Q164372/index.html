-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When assigning hot keys to the command button, check box, or option button
objects, some keys trigger that hot key besides the letter key that was assigned
to it. When assigning the letters G, O, R, or S as hot keys, pressing the
Insert, Delete, Home, or End keys also triggers the objects that these letters
are assigned to. Also, using the hot key letters A, B, and C can be triggered by
the F7, F8, and F9 keys.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use the ON KEY LABEL command to turn off these
keys. Be careful using this method since it might cause problems in some
instances because the Insert, Delete, Home, or End keys may not be available for
things like editing data. The syntax for this command is ON KEY LABEL &lt;key
name&gt; *. Note that the asterisk is what disables the key. To turn the key
back on, issue ON KEY LABEL &lt;key name&gt; without the asterisk. Look in the
"Steps to Reproduce Behavior" section for examples of using this command in a
form.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro
5.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To allow an object to have hot key capability, place the "\&lt;" symbols in
front of the letter that is to be used as the hot key. For example, placing
"\&lt;Quit" in the Caption property of the object allows the pressing of the Q
key to give focus to that object. Any letter in the caption can be assigned as
the hot key. Another example would be "E\&lt;xit", which allows the X key to
become the hot key. No two objects on the form can have the same hot key letter.
Whichever object was assigned the hot key letter first is the one that will
receive focus.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form and add seven command buttons to it.

2. In the Caption property of each command button add the following:

  Button 1: "\&lt;GO TOP" (without the quotation marks)
  Button 2: "\&lt;OFF" (without the quotation marks)
  Button 3: "\&lt;RUN" (without the quotation marks)
  Button 4: "\&lt;SAVE" (without the quotation marks)
  Button 5: "\&lt;APPEND" (without the quotation marks)
  Button 6: "\&lt;BROWSE" (without the quotation marks)
  Button 7: "\&lt;CANCEL" (without the quotation marks)

3. Run the form and press the Insert, Delete, Home, End, F7, F8, and F9 keys.
  Note that after pressing each key, the focus is set to the corresponding
  button.

4. To fix the problem, close the form and add the following code to the Init
  event of the form:

        ON KEY LABEL INS *
        ON KEY LABEL DEL *
        ON KEY LABEL HOME *
        ON KEY LABEL END *
        ON KEY LABEL F7 *
        ON KEY LABEL F8 *
        ON KEY LABEL F9 *

5. If you want to return the keys to their default functionality, add the
  following code to the Destroy event of the form:

        ON KEY LABEL INS
        ON KEY LABEL DEL
        ON KEY LABEL HOME
        ON KEY LABEL END
        ON KEY LABEL F7
        ON KEY LABEL F8
        ON KEY LABEL F9
