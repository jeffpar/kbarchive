SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 added new security settings to SNMP. The security
settings can be found by opening Control Panel, and double-clicking Network.
Click the Services tab, select SNMP, click Properties, and then click Security.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Service Pack 4 has added extended community security to the SNMP service. Now,
both the community name is checked for authentication and the host can define a
level of access. These levels of access are closely aligned with the MIB access
variable. The community security levels are as follows:

- NONE - Cannot read or write any variables.

- NOTIFY - An unsolicited message issent to an SNMP management system.

- READ-ONLY - Cannot set any values.

- READ-WRITE - Can read or write any variables that the MIB definition allows.

- READ-CREATE - Allows the creation of a new row.

The interaction of the MIB access variable and the community security level can
be seen in the following example:

If your community access level is set to READ-ONLY and the MIB access variable is
set at READ-WRITE, the following operations would be valid: get-request,
get-next-request, get-response, and trap. Note that the set-request is blocked
by the more restrictive community access level. So, the combination of these two
security parameters determines the level of functionality the user has with
SNMP.
