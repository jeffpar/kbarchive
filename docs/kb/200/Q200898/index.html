-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

One way of using Systems Management Server through a firewall is to configure
the firewalling or proxy server to allow standard and (MS) RPC port traffic to
pass.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Systems Management Server UDP Information
-----------------------------------------

When NetBIOS over TCP/IP is selected for Systems Management Server Remote
Control, the system uses the following ports:

  Port 137 - name resolution
  Port 138 - messaging (sending the screen image)
  Port 139 - client sessions

When NetBIOS over NWLink is used, the router must forward Type 20 packets (the
packets that provide NetBIOS support).

Microsoft Windows NT UDP Information
------------------------------------

The following list contains the core UDP ports that Windows NT uses and their
function:

  DNS                 udp         53
  DHCP                udp         67
  RPC                 TCP        135
  WINS                udp        137
  NetBIOS datagrams   udp        138
  NetBIOS datagrams   tcp        139

NetBIOS sessions  TCP  139
--------------------------

To list established connections, type "netstat -a" (without the quotation marks)
from a command prompt. This returns additional UDP ports that a computer running
Windows NT Server or Windows NT Workstation is using beyond the core, due to
additional services or applications installed on the Windows NT system.

Microsoft SQL Server UDP Information
------------------------------------

If you are using TCP/IP Net-Library, enable port 1433 on the firewall. Use the
HOSTS file or an advanced connection string for host name resolution.

If you are using Named Pipes over TCP/IP, enable port 139 for NetBIOS functions.
UDP ports 137 and 138 can be enabled for NetBIOS name resolution using b-node
broadcast, but this is not recommended. Instead, a WINS server or LMHOSTS file
should be used.

When SQL Server 6.x is configured to listen on TCP/IP, it uses TCP (not UDP) port
1433 by default. This port can be configured by running SQL Server Setup on the
server and clicking the Change Network Support option. If the default port 1433
is used, the client Net-Library works by default. If a custom port number is
used, the client needs to specify that port in the DSN.

Security Notes
--------------

For added security, using IP filters with your firewall server can be configured
to allow only "registered" addresses use of the ports. There are certain
security concerns created by enabling specific ports on a proxying or
firewalling server. For additional information about these concerns, visit
http://www.microsoft.com/security.

Another method of providing Systems Management Server site, client, and
administrative communication through a firewall could be to use the Systems
Management Server RAS Sender with a Point to Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP; TCP
port 1723) client and server to configure which port is used for initializing
the session, then allow that specific port to be open on the firewall server.
