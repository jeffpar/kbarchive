   - Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition

SUMMARY
=======

When installing Visual C++ on Windows NT Terminal Server for multi-user use, you
must put the system in install mode either by using the Add/Remove Programs tool
in Control Panel or by using the "Change User /install" command at the command
prompt. ("Change user /execute" returns the server to its default running
state.)

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use the following steps to install Visual C++ on Windows NT Terminal Server:

1. Log on to the Terminal Server computer as an Administrator.

2. Open a command shell (Cmd.exe) and run:

  "change user /install" (without the quotation marks)

  This sets the machine to install mode ("change user /query" can be used to
  display the current mode selected).

3. Run the setup program from the Visual Studio CD and install it according to
  its instructions. If you are prompted to type your name during the
  installation process, you may want to give a generic name, because the name
  will be the default for all users. Configure any default program settings you
  want all users to have.

4. The Visual Studio setup program may need multiple reboots depending on the
  components you have chosen to install. When Windows restarts, it always
  starts in execute mode. You need to set the server back to install mode
  before continuing the setup. Before rebooting the machine, add "change user
  /install" to the UsrLogon.cmd file in the system32 directory. The
  UsrLogon.cmd script is always executed when you log in to the Terminal Server
  machine. This ensures that the machine is in install mode after rebooting.

5. After installation is completed, remove the "change user /install" command
  from the UsrLogon.cmd file, log off, and log on to the machine. This
  procedure ensures that the machine is returned to execute mode. Applications
  should always be run in execute mode.
