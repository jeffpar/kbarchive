-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 1.2 SP1, 1.2 SP2, 1.2 SP3, 1.2 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Novell NetWare uses IPX as the default network protocol. NetWare does not use
NetBIOS machine names for client identification purposes; NetWare uses the ID of
the user who is logged on and the computer (MAC) address of the Network
Information Center instead. Consequently, it is possible to have duplicate
machine names on the network in a NetWare environment. Therefore, when a NetWare
client computer becomes a Systems Management Server client, the ID data that is
used is indeed the MAC address.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server version 1.2
service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date         Time         Size     File name    Platform
  ---------------------------------------------------------
  06/07/2001   03:45 P.M.   8,1012   Invdos.exe   Intel

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix or feature that contains
the above files may also contain additional files.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem and have the computers report their NetBIOS machine
names to the Systems Management Server administrator console, use one of the
following methods:

- Have the clients log on to Microsoft Windows NT, or LAN Manager Domain
  controller by using a NetBIOS-compatible transport such as TCP/IP or NetBEUI.

- For Microsoft Windows 3.1, Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 3.11, Microsoft
  Windows 95, or Microsoft Windows 98 clients, use the /M switch for Invdos.exe
  to specify the client's machine identifier (machine name). If the fix that
  this article describes is not applied, the user must manually enter the
  machine name at the time that Invdos.exe is run (during logon) to use the /M
  switch. The fix that this article describes updates the /M switch
  functionality to optionally allow a user to specify a machine identifier on
  the command line for Invdos.exe. To specify a machine name on the command
  line, append the machine name that you want to use to the /M switch when you
  call Invdos.exe. This allows you to use an environment variable that contains
  a machine-specific identifier to override the default SMS identifier
  convention (MAC address).

  NOTE: When you use this method to override the default naming convention, make
  sure that each computer receives a unique identifier to prevent duplication
  in the SMS database.

  The following command line is the correct usage:

  INVDOS /M&lt;machine_name&gt;

  NOTE: Do not include a space between the /M switch and the machine name that
  you want to use.

  The following code is sample usage in SMSLS script that identifies the client
  with the value in the environment variable "MACHINENAME" on that client:

  setls%SMS_OS% -m:E -i -p:%SMS_BIN%\INVDOS.EXE -pa:/m%MACHINENAME% -pa:/l:%%SMS_UNC%%\ -pa:/i -pa:%SMS_VERBOSE%

  NOTE: The use of the /pa: switch is required for the Setls.exe command line to
  indicate to Setls that the data that follows is an argument for Invdos.exe,
  and not for Setls itself. For additional information about the Setls.exe or
  Invdos.exe command-line options, see chapter 2 of the SMS Resource Guide.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.
