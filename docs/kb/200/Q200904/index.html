The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Outlook 97, versions 8.0, 8.01, 8.02, 8.03 
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Outlook 97, messages may have a Received time of None, instead of
the usual date and time values.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may occur if the message was sent while working with a Personal
Folder (PST) file as the primary information store or while working offline with
an Offline Folder (OST) file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Outlook 97.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the message is moved into the Sent Items folder, it will be properly
archived. Messages with None as Received Date that are moved to any folder other
than the Sent Items folder will not be archived.
For more information on messages displayed with a received time of "none", please
see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:
