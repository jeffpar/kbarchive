-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You have a form with code in the KeyPress event and the KeyPreview property is
set to true (.T.). When an ActiveX control has focus, the KeyPress event of the
form does not fire.

CAUSE
=====

The KeyPress event for many ActiveX controls happens to have the same name as
the Visual FoxPro native KeyPress event. ActiveX controls on Visual FoxPro forms
also have their own window. As a result, they handle the KeyPress event
independently of Visual FoxPro.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the KeyPress of the ActiveX control, add the following code as the first line
of the event:

  ThisForm.KeyPress

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form with a command button and an ActiveX control. Use an
  ActiveX control with a KeyPress event, such as the Calendar control. Set the
  KeyPreview property of the form to .T. (true).

2. Add the following code to the following events (assumes default object names
  are used). When finished, save and run the form.

   - Form1.KeyPress:

  WAIT WINDOW "Form" TIMEOUT 1

   - Command1.KeyPress:

  WAIT WINDOW "Button" TIMEOUT 1

   - Olecontrol1.KeyPress:

  WAIT WINDOW "control" TIMEOUT 1

3. With the form running, set focus to the command button and press any key.
  Watch the Wait windows in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. Note
  that the KeyPress event of the form fires before that of the command button.

4. Set focus to the ActiveX control and press any key. The form's KeyPress event
  does not fire, but the control's KeyPress event does.
