SYMPTOMS
========

Internet Information Server 1.0 (IIS) creates a separate thread for Common
Gateway Interface (CGI) application processing. This was not configurable in
Internet Information Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some IIS installations may benefit from using server pool threads to perform CGI
application processing. This reduces the overhead of creating a new thread for
each CGI application running; however, if the CGI requests take an extended
period of time, it can consume a server pool thread.

RESOLUTION
==========

Obtain the fix referenced below (under STATUS), and then modify the registry as
described here. W3svc.dll was modified to accept a registry entry that disables
thread creation for managing CGI application I/O. The new registry entry is
UsePoolThreadForCGI.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run "Net Stop w3svc"

2. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

3. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

     \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\W3svc\Parameters

  The parameters described below are located under this Registry subkey.

  The following describes a new value for the W3SVC service parameters key that
  can only be set by adding an entry in Registry Editor. This value entry does
  not appear by default in the Registry, so you must add an entry if you want
  to change its default value. The W3SVC service must be restarted for changes
  to take effect.

  UsePoolThreadForCGI
     Data Type = REG_DWORD
     Value:
              0 - Use a server pool thread to do CGI processing.
    (Default) 1 - Create a new thread to do CGI processing.

4. Run "Net Start w3svc"

STATUS
======


Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server
version 1.00. A fix to this problem is in development, but has not been
regression-tested and may be destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft
does not recommend implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product
Support Services for more information on the availability of this fix.
