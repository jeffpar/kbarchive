The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 3.51 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

If there are more than 255 connections to the NetWare and File and Print
Services for NetWare (FPNW) server, SETPASS attempts to change the password of
the user whose connection is approximately 255 less than the connection the user
actually has.

For example: If the connection is number 498 and SETPASS is run, the SETPASS
utility will attempt to change the password of the user whose connection number
is approximately 498 - 255.

CAUSE
=====

Libraries for MS-DOS utilities were incorrectly limited to a maximum of 255 user
connections.

RESOLUTION
==========
