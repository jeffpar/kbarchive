-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may not be able to run a server-based setup of Windows 95 from a Novell
NetWare 3.1x or 4.x server if you are using locally administered addresses (LAA)
on your Token Ring network adapter.

CAUSE
=====

Net.exe contains the real-mode Microsoft NetWare redirector (Nwredir.exe).
Nwredir.exe attempts to use the burned-in Token Ring address instead of the LAA,
causing the server not to recognize the workstation's attempt to connect.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix for Windows 95 and OEM Service Release 2 that corrects this
problem is now available from Microsoft, but has not been fully regression
tested and should be applied only to computers experiencing this specific
problem. To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Technical upport
to obtain the fix.

For a complete list of Microsoft Technical Support phone numbers and information
on support costs, please go to the following address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

This fix for Windows 95 and OEM Service Release 2 should have the following file
attributes (or later):

  File name     Version    Date      Time     Size
  ---------------------------------------------------------
  Net.exe       n/a        6/3/96    2:38pm   375,930 bytes


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95 and
Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2).

This issue is not resolved in Microsoft Windows 98. Microsoft does not support
running Windows 98 from a network server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For workstations that have already been set up to run Windows 95 from a NetWare
3.1x or 4.x server, replace the existing Net.exe file in the Windows folder with
this updated file.

For workstations that have not already been set up, replace all copies of the
Net.exe file on the server-based setup server so that Windows 95 Setup uses the
updated Net.exe file during Setup.

please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
