The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
- Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

It is possible that @...SAYs prints with a gray or dark-shaded background when
printed from Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0 using either Microsoft Visual FoxPro
for Windows or FoxPro for Windows 2.6. This problem can be encountered with all
versions of Windows. However, it appears more often under Windows 95 and Windows
NT 4.0.

CAUSE
=====

There are several reasons why @...SAYS may print a shaded background. It could
be because the window color is set to a color other than white in the Windows 95
or Windows NT 4.0 Display Properties. In Microsoft Visual FoxPro and FoxPro for
Windows 2.6, the background color of the desktop will affect the @...SAYs used
in programs. Also, if the @...SAY code is executed from a form in Microsoft
Visual FoxPro or a screen in Microsoft FoxPro for Windows 2.6, the background
color of these objects will affect printout

WORKAROUND
==========

To change the background color of all windows under Windows 95 or Windows NT
4.0, the Window color must be changed in the Appearance tab of the Display
Properties. To change this property, alternate-click on the Windows 95 or
Windows NT 4.0 desktop and select Properties from the Shortcut menu. This will
bring up the Display Properties window. Click on the Appearance tab, and then
select Window in the drop-down list under Item. From the color picker, choose
white.

This option may not be desirable because users will have to keep the window color
white anytime they print in @..SAYs from FoxPro under Windows 95 or Windows NT
4.0. A better way to implement this is to check the background color of the
window or desktop from the code, the form, or the screen prior to issuing the
@...SAY. Below are the steps to implement this with Microsoft Visual FoxPro 3.0
and Microsoft FoxPro for Windows 2.6.

If the @...SAY code is executed from a program in Visual FoxPro for Windows, the
window color can be changed with the following code:

     IF _Screen.BackColor != 16777215    &amp;&amp;Is color value white?
        _Screen.LockScreen = .T.         &amp;&amp;Keep screen from flashing
        cOldbackcolor = _Screen.BackColor      &amp;&amp;Save background color
        _Screen.BackColor = RGB(255,255,255)   &amp;&amp;Set BackColor to RGB white,
                             &amp;&amp;Same as color value 16777215
        SET DEVICE TO PRINTER
        @1,1 say 'This is a test.'
        SET DEVICE TO SCREEN
        SET PRINTER TO
        _Screen.BackColor = cOldbackcolor
        _Screen.LockScreen = .F.
     ENDIF

If the @...SAY code is executed from a form in Visual FoxPro for Windows, the
form's background color can be modified with the following code:

     IF ThisForm.BackColor != 16777215
        ThisForm.LockScreen = .T.
        SET DEVICE TO PRINTER
        cOldbackcolor = ThisForm.BackColor
        ThisForm.BackColor = RGB(255,255,255)
        @1,1 SAY 'This is a test'
        SET DEVICE TO SCREEN
        SET PRINTER TO
        ThisForm.BackColor = cOldbackcolor
        ThisForm.LockScreen = .F.
     ENDIF

NOTE: This code may be placed in the Click event of a Command button.

In FoxPro for Windows 2.6, use the following code to change the window color:

     cOldscheme = SET('Color of Scheme 1')        &amp;&amp;Obtain old color
     MODIFY WINDOW SCREEN COLOR RGB(0,0,0,255,255,255)  &amp;&amp;Set color white
     SET DEVICE TO PRINTER
     @1,1 say ' This is a test.'
     SET DEVICE TO SCREEN
     SET PRINTER TO
     MODIFY WINDOW SCREEN COLOR &amp;cOldscheme

NOTE: In FoxPro 2.6a for Windows, issuing the following command after the SET
DEVICE TO PRINTER command eliminates the gray background:

     SET PRINT FONT "some font name", 10

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the @...SAY code is executed from Visual FoxPro for Windows with Windows 95
or Windows NT 4.0 as the operating system, all printed pages will be shaded.

Using FoxPro for Windows 2.6 and Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0, only the first
page is shaded. All others print normally.


Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In Windows 95 or Windows NT 4.0, right-click the desktop. From the Shortcut
  menu, select Properties.

2. In the Display Properties dialog box, click the Appearance tab. In the Item
  drop-down list, select Window.

3. Click the Color drop-down list, and change the color to gray or any color
  other than white.

4. Open Visual FoxPro for Windows or FoxPro for Windows 2.6, and create a
  program with the following code:

     SET DEVICE TO PRINTER
     FOR i = 1 TO 2       &amp;&amp;Loop shows different output from VFP &amp;FPW26
        @1,1 SAY 'This is a printing test' FONT 'Arial',14
        @3,1 SAY 'From '+VERSION() + ' under ' + OS(1) FONT 'Courier New'
     ENDFOR
     SET DEVICE TO SCREEN
     SET PRINTER TO

  NOTE: The above code can be executed in a FoxPro for Windows 2.6 screen, as
  well as in a Visual FoxPro for Windows 3.0 form.
