The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Close Combat for Windows 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses playing Close Combat over a modem connected to a network
(LAN or WAN).

CONFIGURATION OF THE NETWORK COMPUTER
-------------------------------------

The network computer running Close Combat should be configured as follows:

1. Check to make sure TCP/IP is loaded as a protocol for the Network adapter
  card, as follows:

  a. Click Start, point to Settings, and click Control Panel.

  b. Click Network.

  c. Click the Configuration tab. If TCP/IP is not listed, click Add and follow
     the dialog boxes.

2. Disable the TCP/IP - Dial-Up Adapter protocol, as follows:

  a. Click Start, point to Settings, then click Control Panel.

  b. Double click System, and choose the Device Manager tab.

  c. Click Network Adapters.

  d. Click Dial-Up Adapter, and click Properties.

  e. Under Device Usage, clear the Original Configuration box.

     (Dial-Up Networking is dynamic, so re-starting Windows is not necessary.)

CONFIGURATION FOR THE MODEM USER
--------------------------------

The computer that is connecting to the network with a modem should be configured
as follows:

1. Disable any network cards in the configuration.

2. Connect to the LAN or WAN network using Dial-Up Adapter.

3. Obtain your IP Address.(See the "OBTAINING YOUR IP ADDRESS" section of this
  article.)

OBTAINING YOUR IP ADDRESS
-------------------------

Player 1 must make a list of his/her IP Address and his/her opponent's address.
To determine your IP address, start the game and press the 2 Player option. Your
IP address should be listed. You can also determine your IP Address by starting
MS-DOS. (Press the Start button, point to Programs, and click MS-DOS Prompt.
Type "winipcfg", without the quotation marks.)

STARTING THE GAME
-----------------

1. Both players start Close Combat, and press the 2 Player option button on the
  Command screen.

2. Player 1 (the player who has a list of both IP Addresses), clicks Initiate
  Connection, enters the opponent's IP Address in the space provided, and
  presses OK.

3. Player 2 clicks Wait For Connection and presses OK.

Once both players hear the Artificial Entity announce "Connection Established,"
both can click Begin to start the game.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Dial-Up Networking binds to the TCP/IP protocol last and therefore is the
default. For the player who chooses Wait For Connection, Close Combat looks to
the Dial-Up Networking protocol, if present, regardless of the chosen IP
Address.
