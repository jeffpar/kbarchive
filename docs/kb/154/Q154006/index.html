SUMMARY
=======

A window can be moved by clicking the Title bar and then dragging the window to
the required position. This technique will not work if the window doesn't have a
Title bar. Using the SendMessage API, you can achieve this effect by dragging a
control on the form and the form will move with the control. Below is a code
sample showing how to accomplish this.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Place a Command button on the form.

3. Add the following code to the Form1 code window:

     Option Explicit
     Private Declare Sub ReleaseCapture Lib "User" ()
     Private Declare Function SendMessage Lib "User" (ByVal hWnd As _
        Integer, ByVal wMsg As Integer, ByVal wParam As Integer, _
        lParam As Any) As Long

     Private Const WM_SYSCOMMAND = &amp;H112
     Private Const MOUSE_MOVE = &amp;HF012

     ' Enter the line below as one line of code
     Private Sub Command1_MouseDown(Button As Integer, Shift As Integer,  _
     X As Single, Y As Single)
         Dim lReturn As Long
         Call ReleaseCapture
         lReturn = SendMessage(Form1.hWnd, WM_SYSCOMMAND, MOUSE_MOVE, 0)
     End Sub

4. Press the F5 key to run the project. Note that if you drag the Command button
  on the screen, the whole form will move with it.

You could remove the Title bar by adjusting the Control box, Caption, and
Borderstyle properties of the form and the form can still be dragged by the
control.
