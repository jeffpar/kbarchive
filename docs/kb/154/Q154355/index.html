-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You may be unable to establish a trust relationship to a remote domain where the
domain controller (DC) is across a dialup router due to timeout reasons. This
timeout will cause an additional connection attempt to the remote domain
controller to be made every 15 minutes until a connection is achieved. This can
become expensive if the dialup line is an ISDN line you are paying for a router
dialing every 15 minutes.

CAUSE
=====

The Netlogon service in Microsoft Windows NT is hard-coded to wait 15 seconds to
establish the trust. If the router line is busy or very slow, the response from
the remote domain controller may timeout.

A dialup router can take longer to make a connection to the remote DC than
Netlogon will wait. Even if the line is not busy, it can take as long as 30 to
90 seconds to make a connection to the remote network. Netlogon by default will
send out three broadcast/multicast &lt;1C&gt; frames looking for the domain
controller at +/- five-second intervals.

If the DC isn't found with these three broadcasts, the Netlogon service will
repeat this sequence every 15 minutes until it succeeds.


RESOLUTION
==========

Apply the hotfix mentioned below. The hotfix consists of a new Netlogon registry
entry that adds an additional delay to each of the Netlogon broadcast/multicast
&lt;1C&gt; frames sent, thus causing Netlogon to wait longer for
NlDcDiscoveryMachine to succeed. The formula for the wait time is as follows:

  5 seconds + ( ExpectedDialupDelay / 3 ).

If the ExpectedDialupDelay is set to 90 seconds, the wait time would be:

  5 + ( 90 / 3 ) = 35,

thus, a 35-second interval between frames.

The registry information for the new parameter is:

  Location: HKLM\System\CCS\Services\Netlogon\Parameters
  Value Name: ExpectedDialupDelay
  Data Type:  Reg_Dword
  Data Value is in seconds (default = 0)
  Range between 0 and 600 seconds (10 minutes)

ExpectedDialupDelay (in seconds)

This parameter specifies the time it takes for a dialup router to dial when
sending a message from this client computer to a domain trusted by this client
computer. Typically, Netlogon assumes a domain controller is reachable in a
short time period (about 15 seconds). Setting ExpectedDialupDelay informs
Netlogon to expect an ADDITIONAL delay of the time specified.


If for some reason this does not work, you should add a second entry to the
registry. This entry will force the Scavenge Timer to increase the interval to
retry the connection to the remote DC. This will decrease markedly the amount of
dialups for trust verification.

The registry information for the new parameter is:

  Location: HKLM\System\CCS\Services\Netlogon\Parameters
  Value Name: ScavengeInterval
  Data Type:  Reg_Dword
  Data Value is in seconds (default = 900 (15 minutes))
  Range between 60 seconds (1 minute) and 172800 seconds (2 days)


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
