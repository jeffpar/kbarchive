SUMMARY
=======

In Chapter 6 of the Microsoft Exchange Administrator's Guide there are
documented procedures to move the Key Management Server to another server in the
same site. The directions in this section are misleading and could lead to
difficulties in moving the Key Management server. In particular, the
"Administrator's Guide" makes no mention of needing the ORGINAL Key Management
server disk that was created on installation for this process to succeed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Here are the revised instructions for moving an existing Key Management server
to another server in the same site:

It is recommended that you DO NOT move the Key Management server from one
Microsoft Exchange Server computer to another because of the critical
information kept in the Key Management database. There is, however, a mechanism
for moving the Key Management server if the need arises.

1. Back up the advanced security data on the Microsoft Exchange Server computer
  that hosts the Key Management server. See "Backing Up and Restoring Advanced
  Security Data" in the Microsoft "Administrator's Guide," Chapter 6.

2. Use the Services option in Control Panel to stop the Microsoft Key Management
  Service.

3. Run the Key Management server Setup program and select the REMOVE ALL option.
  This will rename your Security directory to Security.bak and remove the Key
  Management server components.

4. Go to the Microsoft Exchange Server that will now host the Key Management
  server.

5. Run the Key Management server Setup program, which is on the Microsoft
  Exchange Server compact disc in the EXCHKey Management directory.

6. Use the Services option in Control Panel to stop the Microsoft Key Management
  Service.

7. Restore the advanced security data on the server where you ran the Key
  Management server. See "Backing Up and Restoring Advanced Security Data" in
  the Microsoft "Administrator's Guide," Chapter 6.

8. Place the ORIGINAL Key Management server disk (from the original install of
  the Key Management server) into drive A and start the Key Management server
  service.

9. After allowing for replication to occur within your organization (this could
  take several hours depending on your topology), run the Key Management server
  setup program on each of the other sites in your organization.

The original Key Management disk is needed because it contains the 64-bit
encryption key for the database. Because the data that is being moved was
created with this key, it needs to be present to issue and revoke certificates
on the new location. If this disk is not used, new tokens will need to be issued
for all users in the organization.

STATUS
======

This process is by design; future versions of the Microsoft Exchange
Administrator's Guide will be updated to reflect the above instructions. It is
highly recommended that the disk that is created during the Key Management
server Setup be backed up and kept in a secure place in the event that the
original is lost or damaged.
