SYMPTOMS
========

Hewlett-Packard (HP) scanners may not be detected properly by the Deskscan
program when you are using a BusLogic BT-542b SCSI host adapter.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when you are connecting a HP scanner to a BusLogic SCSI
host adapter with a BIOS firmware revision of 3.35/4.70. The HP scanner is
properly detected with earlier versions of the BIOS.

RESOLUTION
==========

Contact either BusLogic for a possible BIOS upgrade or Hewlett-Packard for an
updated version of Deskscan.


MORE INFORMATION
================

After you start Deskscan, your computer may slow for 3-4 minutes before Deskscan
finally appears and misreports the scanner as absent. If you attempt to test for
the presence of the scanner, the computer slows again for 3-4 minutes. If you
opt to view the SCSI address settings within Deskscan, a scanner is reported at
all eight IDs, even when it and the adapter are the only devices on the bus.
Regedt32 reports the situation properly.

This behavior has been reported with the HP ScanJet IIp and IIc using the
BusLogic BT-646s h/a (MCA card) adapter and also on a PowerPC using the BT-542B
and BT-545S SCSI controllers.

NOTE: The scanners on the Windows NT 4.0 Hardware Compatibility List were not
tested on BusLogic controllers. These scanners are only supported if connected
to one of the following SCSI controllers: AHA-1542CP, AHA-2742, and AHA-2940,
NCR 8100S, and 8250S.
