SUMMARY
=======

The AVIDD95 sample demonstrates streaming of video data from an Audio- Video
Interleaved (.AVI) file onto a full screen DirectDraw surface (Mode X). It plays
the video as fast as possible. The maximum video size supported by the sample is
320x240 and the bit depth is dithered down to 8-bit regardless of the current
video mode. This sample includes all source code and supporting files (.mak,
.mdp, etc.) as the sample was developed using Microsoft's Visual C++ 4.x
Developer Studio. In order to build the sample, the development environment must
include the DirectX 2 SDK.

AVIDD95 uses the following steps to stream the video onto the DirectDraw
surface:

1. Opens the video stream from an .AVI file by means of the
  AVIStreamOpenFromFile.

2. Reads the source video stream format by means of the AVIStreamReadFormat.

3. Reads a frame from the video stream by means of the AVIStreamRead.

4. Converts the frame from the source format to the target format.

5. Draws the decompressed frame by means of the standard DirectDraw calls.

6. Repeat steps 3-5 for every frame (found by AVIStreamLength).

In AVIDD95, Mode X is utilized exclusively, requiring the video stream to be
decompressed and dithered down from the native format, such as 16-bit or 24-bit,
to 8-bit RGB. Decompression and dithering is accomplished by calling
ICDecompress before passing the frame on to the drawing routine.
