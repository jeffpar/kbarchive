-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT client workstations may open large numbers of \pipe\spoolss
connections to a print server. This usually occurs when you start an application
(such as Microsoft Word) that queries printers. The spoolss process on both the
client and the server will open a large number of handles related to these
connections.

CAUSE
=====

When the application opens the printer, the spooler detects that some of the
printer attributes on the server have changed and the local cache is invalid.
The client then refreshes the cache, including form information. For each form,
a WM_DEVMODECHANGE is issued, which causes the problem. When winword.exe sees
this message, it thinks the printer configuration has changed and reopens it. A
lot of these messages are sent, causing Word to go into a tight loop opening
printers.


A Remote Procedure Call (RPC) requires one named pipe instance for every active
RPC call. Because there are all these OpenPrinter calls (which are hanging), RPC
needs many named pipes. RPC won't destroy these instances until all context
handles (that is, all OpenPrinters) have been closed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Obtain the fix referenced below. Apply this fix to the Windows NT client
system(s) to correct the problem.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Base:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
