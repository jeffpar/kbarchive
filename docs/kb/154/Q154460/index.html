-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition

SYMPTOMS
========

As your computer is being attacked there may be a jump in bandwidth utilization
on a subnet containing Windows NT computers and performance may suffer. A
network analyzer shows a large amount of UDP traffic, typically from port 19
(chargen).

CAUSE
=====

A malicious attack may be mounted against Windows NT computers with the Simple
TCP/IP Services installed. The attack consists of a flood of UDP datagrams sent
to the subnet broadcast address with the destination port set to 19 and a
spoofed source IP address. The Windows NT computers running Simple TCP/IP
services respond to each broadcast, creating a flood of UDP datagrams.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT TCP/IP, Windows Sockets, and Simple TCP/IP services have been
modified to be more attack resistant. Windows Sockets now supports a new socket
option, SO_BROADCAST, that can be set to allow the recvfrom() call to pass
broadcast datagrams to the application. The default for this option is OFF.
Previous implementations passed broadcasts datagrams to any Windows Sockets
application that issued a recvfrom() call. Additionally, the chargen service and
other Simple TCP/IP services have been modified to drop any datagrams that have
the source port equal to the destination port to prevent "looping" attacks.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack

NOTE: An updated version of this hotfix was posted on August 15, 1997.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this problem could result in some degree of security
vulnerability in Windows NT version 4.0. This problem was first corrected in
