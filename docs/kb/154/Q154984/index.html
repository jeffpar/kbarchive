The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Your Domain Name System (DNS) server does not recursively resolve names which
contain a large number of IP addresses. However, the DNS server does resolve
names which contain one or a small number of IP addresses.

CAUSE
=====

When a DNS response contains more data than can fit in a UPD packet (more than
512 bytes,) it sends as much data that can fit into the UDP packet and sets the
truncation bit, indicating that there is more data available.

The Microsoft DNS server discards packets with the truncation bit set and tries
another authoritative server. The DNS server always receives the same response
with the truncation bit set, so it eventually stops and returns SERVFAIL to the
client.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


The Microsoft DNS Server has been modified to accept truncated responses and
return that response to the client.

For your convenience, the English version of this post-SP3 hotfix has been posted
to the following Internet location. However, Microsoft recommends that you
install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 to correct this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
