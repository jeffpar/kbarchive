SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to move a Microsoft Exchange Public Folder from one
Microsoft Exchange Site, in which the public folder was created, to another
Site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Public folders can be moved between Microsoft Exchange Servers in the same Site
by creating a replica on another Server in the Site and then removing the
original replica from the Server where the public folder was created.

However, this method cannot be used to move public folder between Sites. You can
replicate a public folder to a Server in another Site, but when you try to
remove the last replica of the public folder in the original Site, the following
error message will be displayed:

  You cannot remove all replicas of the folder from this site.
  Microsoft Exchange Administrator
  ID no:c1035e6a

To move a public folder from one Site (SiteA) to another (SiteB), follow these
steps:

1. From a Microsoft Exchange client logged in to a mailbox in SiteA, copy the
  public folder to a .PST file.

2. Delete the public folder in SiteA.

3. From another Microsoft Exchange client logged in to a mailbox that has a
  Microsoft Exchange Public Folder Server in SiteB, copy the public folder from
  the .PST file to the Public Folder Store.

The public folder should now be re-created on a Public Folder Server in SiteB.
