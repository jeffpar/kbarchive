-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft dbWeb, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to start the dbWeb Service, you may receive the following error
message:

  Could not start dbWeb Service service on \\servername. Error 1067: The
  process terminated unexpectedly.

CAUSE
=====

Upon startup, the dbWeb service attempts to establish a connection with the
dbWeb repository (a Microsoft Access database file called Dbweb.mdb located in
the \Dbweb\Admin) folder. If this attempt fails, the service quits with an Error
1067. The failure may be related to a misconfiguration with the ODBC system data
source (System DSN) named "dbWebSchema." The service uses this data source to
communicate with the repository. Ensure that "dbWebSchema" points to the proper
file (Dbweb.mdb). The service will also terminate if Dbweb.mdb is corrupted.
Repair the database file using Microsoft Access or the dbWeb Administrator
(Utilities menu). Also, if the repository (Dbweb.mdb) is exclusively opened by
another process, the same error message will occur.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following steps list possible reasons why the dbWeb Service won't start and
the steps needed to correct the problem. The steps are divided into the
following sections:

- Misconfiguration of ODBC System Data Source

   - No dbWebSchema Data Source

   - There is a dbWebSchema Data Source

- Corrupted Dbweb.mdb

- Dbweb.mdb Opened Exclusively

You should first follow the steps in the "Misconfiguration of ODBC System Data
Source" section, because it is the most common reason for the error. This
section is divided into two subsections: the "No dbWebSchema Data Source"
section, which details the steps of recreating the dbWebSchema data source; and
the "There is a dbWebSchema Data Source" section, which makes sure the current
dbWebSchema data source is set up properly. The "Corrupted Dbweb.mdb" and the
"Dbweb.mdb Opened Exclusively" sections are other possible causes of the error.
However, you should try these sections only after you have follow the steps in
the "Misconfiguration of ODBC System Data Source" section.

Misconfiguration of ODBC System Data Source
-------------------------------------------

1. Open Control Panel and double-click the 32-bit ODBC icon.

2. In the Data Sources dialog box, click the System DSN button.

3. In the System Data Sources dialog box, you should see a schema called
  "dbWebSchema" (not case sensitive).

  NO DBWEBSCHEMA DATA SOURCE

4. If you do see a dbWebSchema data source, then skip to the steps under the
  "There is a dbWebSchema Data Source" section. If you don't, then click the
  Add button.

5. In the Add Data Source dialog box, select the Microsoft Access Driver
  (*.mdb), and then click OK.

6. In the ODBC Microsoft Access Setup dialog box, type "dbWebSchema" in the line
  next to the Data Source Name.

7. Click the Select button under the Database section.

8. In the Select Database dialog box, select the Dbweb.mdb database. The default
  folder for the Dbweb.mdb is \dbWeb\Admin. Once you've chosen the Dbweb.mdb,
  click OK.

9. Once you're back in the ODBC Microsoft Access Setup dialog box, click OK.

  THERE IS A DBWEBSCHEMA DATA SOURCE

10. If the dbWebSchema data source is listed in the Data Sources dialog box,
  select the data source, and click the Setup button.

11. In the ODBC Microsoft Access Setup dialog box, verify that the path next to
  the "Database:" in the Database section points to the Dbweb.mdb. If it
  doesn't, then click the Select button. In the Select Database dialog box,
  select the Dbweb.mdb database. The default folder for the Dbweb.mdb is
  \dbWeb\Admin. Once you've chosen the Dbweb.mdb, click OK.

12. If it is pointing to the Dbweb.mdb, then delete the data source and recreate
  it. See the steps in the "No dbWebSchema Data Source" section for
  information about recreating the data source.

Corrupted DBWEB.MDB
-------------------

If the above steps don't solve the problem, the Dbweb.mdb may be corrupted. To
repair the Dbweb.mdb, follow these steps:

1. Open the dbWeb Administrator.

2. In the dbWeb Administrator, on the File menu, click Close.

3. On the Utilities menu, click Repair Database.

4. In the Select Database to Repair dialog box, select Dbweb.mdb. The default
  folder for the Dbweb.mdb is \dbWeb\Admin. Once you've chosen the Dbweb.mdb,
  click OK.

  In the status bar at the bottom of the dbWeb Administrator you should see
  "Repairing:," and then the path to the Dbweb.mdb. Then it will say "Ready"
  when it is finished.

5. If the database has unrecoverable errors that the Repair utility couldn't
  fix, then restore a copy of Dbweb.mdb from you backup copy.

Dbweb.mdb Opened Exclusively
----------------------------

If the Dbweb.mdb is opened exclusively by another process (or user), the dbWeb
Service data source can't make the initial connection, and you will receive an
error message.

Make sure that no other user has Dbweb.mdb open exclusively. Also, check for any
other programs (such as Microsoft Access) that may have the Dbweb.mdb open
exclusively.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft dbWeb version 1.0.
This problem no longer occurs in Microsoft dbWeb version 1.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Open Control Panel and double-click the 32bit ODBC icon.

2. In the Data Sources dialog box, click the System DSN button.

3. In the System Data Sources dialog box, select the dbWebSchema data source,
  click the Delete button, and then click Close.

4. In the Data Sources dialog box, click the Close button.

5. In Control Panel, double-click the Services icon.

6. In the Service dialog box, select the dbWeb Service, and then click the Start
  button. Note that within a few seconds, you receive the error message
  mentioned in the "Symptoms" section.
