SUMMARY
=======

The Visual Basic function called KILL enables a user to delete a file from disk.
Under Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me, Windows NT 4.0, and Windows 2000,
files can be deleted into the Recycle Bin, giving a user the ability to reclaim
deleted items. The KILL function does not offer this functionality to the Visual
Basic Programmer. This article describes how to use the SHFileOperation Win32
API to enable a user to delete a file and place it in the Recycle Bin. Below is
a code sample showing how to use the API in Visual Basic.

The Recycle Bin option to remove files immediately when deleted should be turned
off in order for this sample to function as designed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Place a Command button on Form1.

3. Add the following code to the Form1 code window:

        Option Explicit

        Private Type SHFILEOPSTRUCT
          hwnd As Long
          wFunc As Long
          pFrom As String
          pTo As String
          fFlags As Integer
          fAnyOperationsAborted As Boolean
          hNameMappings As Long
          lpszProgressTitle As String
        End Type

        Private Declare Function SHFileOperation Lib "shell32.dll" Alias _
          "SHFileOperationA" (lpFileOp As SHFILEOPSTRUCT) As Long
        Private Declare Function GetTempFileName Lib "kernel32" _
          Alias "GetTempFileNameA" (ByVal lpszPath As String, _
          ByVal lpPrefixString As String, ByVal wUnique As Long, _
          ByVal lpTempFileName As String) As Long

        Private Const FO_DELETE = &amp;H3
        Private Const FOF_ALLOWUNDO = &amp;H40

        Sub Command1_Click()
          Dim FileOperation As SHFILEOPSTRUCT
          Dim lReturn As Long
          Dim sTempFilename As String * 100
          Dim sSendMeToTheBin As String
          lReturn = GetTempFileName("c:\", "VB_", 0, sTempFilename)
          sSendMeToTheBin = Left(sTempFilename, InStr(sTempFilename, _
             Chr$(0)))
          With FileOperation
             .wFunc = FO_DELETE
             .pFrom = sSendMeToTheBin
             .pTO = vbNullChar   ' Not used
             .fFlags = FOF_ALLOWUNDO
          End With
          lReturn = SHFileOperation(FileOperation)
          MsgBox "View your Recycle Bin for files beginning with VB_"
        End Sub

4. Press the F5 key to run the project, and click the Command button. You will
  be prompted to confirm the deletion of the file. In your Recycle Bin, there
  will be a file with the prefix "VB_" that is the file created by the
  GetTempFileName Win32 API call.
