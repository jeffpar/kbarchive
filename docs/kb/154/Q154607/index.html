-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Macintosh client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you configure the Microsoft Exchange client for offline synchronization,
the complete mailbox hierarchy is replicated to the offline folder file (OST),
even though some of the folders are not configured for offline use. This makes
it possible for you to delete a non- replicated folder while working offline.
When you start to work online again and synchronization takes place, the
non-replicated folder and its contents are deleted from the mailbox.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is by product design.

Steps to reproduce:
-------------------

1. Start Microsoft Exchange client configured for local replication and choose
  Connect when prompted for a connection type.

2. Create a folder called Test and copy several items to it. Make sure this
  folder is not configured as an offline folder.

3. Quit Exchange.

4. Start Exchange Client and choose Work Offline when prompted for a connection
  type. Notice the Test folder appears to be empty, although it is not.

5. Delete the Test folder. No error message results. However, the folder is
  moved to the Deleted Items folder.

6. Quit Exchange. By default, this will purge the Deleted Items folder and
  delete the Test folder from the Exchange hierarchy.

7. Start Microsoft Exchange client and choose Connect when prompted for a
  connection type.

Results:
The folder hierarchy is automatically synchronized, removing the Test folder and
its contents.
