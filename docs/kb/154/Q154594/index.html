-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use PC-NFS Version 2.2x for Windows NT with Microsoft Windows NT 3.5x and
you upgrade to Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, the PC-NFS logon box no longer appears
after the upgrade.

CAUSE
=====

During the upgrade, a Microsoft Windows NT registry key returns to default
values for Windows NT 4.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

To remedy the problem after the Windows NT 4.0 upgrade, you will need to edit
the registry value USERINIT by using the following procedure.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. In the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, locate the following registry key:

  /SOFTWARE/Microsoft/WindowsNT/CurrentVersion/Winlogon

3. Double-click the USERINIT value and add the following text to the existing
  string:

  ,&lt;PC-NFS product directory&gt;\nfslogin.exe -w

  For example: ,c:\ntnfs\nfslogin.exe -w

NOTE: Please be sure to include the comma that precedes the additional text. This
comma must be present to separate this parameter from the previous entries.
