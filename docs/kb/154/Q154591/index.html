-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2 
- Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The wrong version of MSVCRT40.DLL, known as the Forwarder DLL, may be copied to
the Windows 95 System directory while installing Visual C++ version 4.2. The
size, date, and version number of this DLL are:

  MSVCRT40.DLL 65,024 Bytes 6/14/96 Version 4.2000.6164

This behavior may cause some applications built with Visual C++ Version 4.0 and
4.1 to break.

CAUSE
=====

If Visual C++ is installed on Windows 95 with a CD-ROM install, then the
MSVCRT40.DLL is copied to the Windows 95 System directory. This DLL may also be
present if a beta version of Visual C++ 4.2 was previously installed.


RESOLUTION
==========

Copy the correct version of the DLL provided in the Visual C++ 4.2 CD-ROM
MSDEV\REDIST\ANSI directory. The size, date, and version number of this DLL
are:

  MSVCRT40.DLL 326,656 Bytes 2/19/96 Version 4.10.6038

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Visual C++ version 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The REDISTRB.WRI file in the MSDEV\REDIST directory of the Visual C++ 4.2 CD-ROM
mentions that the C Run-Time Forwarder DLL MSVCRT40.DLL should not be
redistributed. The redistributable DLLs are the Shared DLL version of the Visual
C++ 4.1 C Run-Time DLL MSVCRT40.DLL available in the MSDEV\REDIST\ANSI
directory, MSVCRT.DLL the Shared DLL version of C Run- Time, and MSVCIRT.DLL the
Shared DLL version of the iostream functions.

The Forwarder DLL, MSVCRT40.DLL, is supplied with the Windows NT 4.0 Operating
System. This DLL will be necessary for upward compatibility of applications
built with Visual C++ version 4.0 and 4.1 to run in Windows NT 4.0 and later
versions of Windows Operating Systems.

Note that applications built in Visual C++ 4.2 and 5.0 with the /MD compiler
switch only use the MSVCRT.DLL or MSVCRT.DLL and MSVCIRT.DLL depending on the
header files included.

The Visual C++ 5.0 CD-ROM, contains only the MSVCRT40.DLL, Version 4.10.6038, in
both the ...\VC\REDIST\ and the ...\VC\REDIST\ANSI\ directories.

The Visual C++ 6.0 CD-ROM contains the non-Forwarder version of the MSVCRT40.DLL
in the ...\OS\System directory. The new version number is 4.21.0000, the size is
the same at 326,656 bytes.

The Visual C++ 6.0 Service Pack 3 and 4 contains the non-Forwarder version of the
MSVCRT40.DLL in the ...\OS\System directory. The version number is 4.22.0.0, the
size is the same at 326,656 bytes.

The Windows NT 4.0 operating system Forwarder version of the MSVCRT40.DLL is
version number 4.2000.0.6172. This DLL comes with the operating system and it
cannot be redistributed. Do not replace this DLL with any other version. To view
the version of the MSVCRT40.DLL, click Properties in Microsoft Windows Explorer.
Verify that "4.20 - OS use only. DO NOT DISTRIBUTE" is the version.

Windows 2000 operating system Forwarder version of the MSVCRT40.DLL is version
number 4.2000.0.6201. This DLL comes with the operating system and it cannot be
redistributed. Do not replace this DLL with any other version.
