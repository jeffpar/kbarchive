  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

When you are using MSN, The Microsoft Network, you can participate in Chats,
which are multiple-user group forums in which you can send and receive text and
thereby be part of a discussion. Windows 95 includes a Chat program for use with
MSN, but several third-party alternatives are available that can replace the
default program. However, these alternative Chat programs set themselves as the
default program, and some do not offer a way to change back to the standard Chat
program. This article describes how to change back to the standard Chat program
by editing the registry.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Examples of third-party Chat programs for MSN are SuperChat and UK Chat. Both
programs offer the standard functionality of the standard Chat program, but
include other features such as customizable user icons, private messages, and
macro keystrokes. These programs may not offer a way to change back to the
standard Chat program without removing the program. You can edit the registry to
change the default Chat program.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To change back to the standard Chat program, modify the Filename value in the
following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MOS\Applications\App #4

Set the Filename value to the path for the standard Chat program (Textchat.exe).
For example, set the path to:

  C:\Program Files\The Microsoft Network\Textchat.exe
