- Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 4.2

SUMMARY
=======

When installing Visual C++ 4.2, you may get several missing file/directory
messages. The first message usually is:

  "Setup cannot access the source file X:\MSDEV\include\ALGORITHM"

where X is the CD-ROM drive letter or a network mapped CD-ROM drive letter.

Other messages include missing files such as EXCEPTION, FUNCTIONAL, STDEXCEPT,
STREAMBUF, and STRSTREAM. All of them are in X:\MSDEV\include directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The error messages are generated if a real-mode CD-ROM driver is used to install
Visual C++ 4.2 in Windows 95. Real-mode CD-ROM drivers cannot access long file
names. You may also see these error messages if you run the Visual C++ setup
program across the network and the network driver does not support long file
names.

The file names listed above are more than eight characters long. These files are
the header files for the Standard C++ Library. In order to make these files
available on your system, you may want to copy them manually from CD-ROM to the
\msdev\include directory on your hard drive. Note that you are able to see only
the abbreviated file names if the driver you are using supports only 8.3 file
names. You can rename the files after you copy them to your hard drive. Below is
a table that lists the abbreviated file names and the full file names:

  05/28/96  01:04a            47,951 ALGORI~1        algorithm
  06/04/96  07:03p             1,860 EXCEPT~1        exception
  05/28/96  01:05a             9,656 FUNCTI~1        functional
  05/28/96  01:05a             2,970 STDEXC~1        stdexcept
  05/28/96  01:05a             6,087 STREAM~1        streambuf
  05/28/96  01:05a             3,813 STRSTR~1        strstream

REFERENCES
==========

This information is also available in the VCREAD.WRI file located in the MSDEV
directory of the Visual C++ CD, which reads as follows:

  "If you are running Windows 95 and are using real-mode CD-ROM drivers, you
  will not be able to access long filenames from the Visual C++ CD. This may
  cause errors during Setup."
