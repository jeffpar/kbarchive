SUMMARY
=======

What is Microsoft Passport?:

Microsoft Passport consists of two services: a Single Sign-in service that allows
members to use a single name and password to sign-in to a growing number of
participating Web sites, and a Wallet service that members can use to make fast,
secure online purchases.

Kids Passport, an optional feature of the single sign-in service, offers you an
easily implemented, turnkey solution for obtaining parental consent to collect
or disclose a child's personal information. This facilitates your Web site's
compliance with the parental-consent requirements of the Children's Online
Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). You can choose to use just one or the other,
according to your needs.

By using Passport, members can more easily control what information they provide
to Web sites and how it is used. Passport can also help your online business
increase revenue and build stronger relationships with consumers by streamlining
purchases, improving targeting, and promoting privacy.

MORE INFORMATION
================

What is the Single Sign-in and Profile Service?:

The Single Sign-in service allows members to create one sign-in name and password
that they can conveniently use on your Web site and across all participating
Passport sites. That means there's only one name and password to remember. To
sign-in to your site, members click a Sign-In link we provide for you. After
they sign in, the link changes to a Sign Out link that members can click to sign
out.

In addition, you can also personalize your Web site based on the information in
the Passport sign-in profile that each member creates with the Passport. (The
sign-in profile contains the member's country, state, zip code, and so on.) The
sign-in profile is sent to you automatically when a member signs in to your Web
site.

Kids Passport is available to Web sites participating in the Single Sign-in
service. The service lets you avoid the deployment and management costs
associated with creating your own parental-consent systems, and it can help you
comply with COPPA. Furthermore, it can help you increase visibility and attract
young visitors. Kids Passport provides flexible implementation options, so you
can tailor the service to serve your specific needs.

What is the Wallet Service?:

The Wallet service makes shopping online easier, faster, and more secure for
visitors to your Web site. Your customers will no longer have to complete long
order forms to make a purchase on your site. When a customer has stored credit
card and address information in the Passport Wallet, making a purchase at any
participating site is as easy as choosing which card and address to use, without
having to retype them.

To make a purchase, consumers click a Passport Wallet button or Passport branded
text link next to the product they want to purchase. The button or link takes
them to their Passport Wallet page, which prominently features your branding and
text. You also determine the page's background color and font styles, as well as
additional purchase fields. Consumers select the credit card and shipping
address to use for the purchase, and then send the information to you to
complete the transaction.
