SUMMARY
=======

This article lists the new features and changes that are implemented in version
1.4 of the Microsoft Passport express purchase (EP) service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

- The service used to implement Passport wallet is now known as Passport
  express purchase (EP). This is a terminology change only and has no impact on
  code. However, it may affect the way your refer to the service on your site.

- The Express Purchase Implementation Guide is now included in the same table
  of contents as the documentation for the Passport single sign-in (SSI)
  service and Kids Passport service. This is intended as a convenience for
  sites that will implement more than one service.

- The Passport Wallet server now supports a flexible-layout cobranding
  technique. Using this technique, participant sites can cobrand specific
  elements of the Passport wallet user interface (UI) and the EP service, as
  well as enclose the entire UI inside a page layout of their choosing.

- Means-of-payment instruments (such as credit cards) that are supported by
  Passport EP are now listed in a convenient table.
