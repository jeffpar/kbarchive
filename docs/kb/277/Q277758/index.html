SUMMARY
=======

This article lists the client-side and server-side requirements for using the
Microsoft Passport Express Purchase (EP) service.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Client-side requirements:

- Each client user must have a Passport. The user must have registered as a
  Passport user and have provided at least the required elements of the
  Passport core profile.

- The client browser must be capable of accepting cookies and be configured to
  accept them.

- The browsers must support Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).

- Browsers must be JavaScript capable and enabled.

Server-side requirements:

- The participant site must be a Passport-registered site and have a
  Passport-issued Site ID.

Without the Site ID, the Passport EP service cannot verify that a participant
site is legitimate. When a participant site applies for a Passport Site ID, it
also must specify a root domain. When requesting user data from the Passport EP
service, any private user data that is requested must be returned into that
domain to corroborate the validity of the supplied Site ID. After you have
completed the registration process, you are provided with an official Passport
Site ID. Include the Site ID number as a query string parameter whenever you
direct a user to the Passport Wallet server from your site.

- Pages that are specified as "return URLs" (that is, the pages on a site that
  actually receive and process the posted wallet data) must be served by means
  of HTTPS protocol.

- Any material that is used in Passport EP service cobranding must also be
  served by HTTPS.
