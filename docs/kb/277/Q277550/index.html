-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
- Microsoft Windows 2000 Datacenter Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you quit Resource Monitor, the Cluster service may continue to try to
restart resources. When this occurs, the cluster may not work, and you may see
the following symptoms:

- Each node sees the other node as down
- Each node terminates the Resrcmon.exe program
- Each node keeps trying to bring resources online
- Each node cannot bring the resources online and blocks, waiting for the
  quorum resource

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you run out of resource monitors in which to run
resources.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, upgrade to Service Pack 4 (SP4) or later if you are
using a computer that is running Microsoft Windows NT 4.0. If you are not using
a computer that is running Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, verify that you do not have
resources set to run in their own resource monitor. Resources that are set to
run in their own resource monitor consume an entire resource monitor and reduce
the maximum number of resources that a cluster can support.

If the server is a file server, you may want to implement dynamic file shares to
share all home folders under a single resource. For additional information about
file share resources on a cluster, click the article numbers below to view the
articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q220819 How to Configure Dfs Root on a Windows 2000 Server Cluster

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There is a limit to the number of resources supported on a Server Cluster.

Server Clustering supports up to 930 resources: 15 resource threads multiplied by
62 resource monitors equals 930 total resources.

After you install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4), the number of resource
threads increases to 27, including Windows 2000, and later 27 resources threads
multiplied by 62 resource monitors equals 1674 total resources.
