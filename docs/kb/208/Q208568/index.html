MORE INFORMATION
================

1. What is the Pocket Outlook Object Model (POOM) SDK?

  The Pocket Outlook Object Model SDK is the means by which the object model for
  Pocket Outlook is exposed to programmers using the Windows CE Toolkit for
  Visual Basic 6.0 (VBCE6) and the Windows CE Toolkit for Visual C++ 6.0
  (VCCE6). This allows for programmatic manipulation of Contact, Calendar and
  Task data as well as the capability to view City and TimeZone information.
2. Where to obtain the POOM SDK.

  The POOM SDK can be downloaded from the following Microsoft Web site:

  Pocket Outlook Object Model (POOM) SDK Download
  htt p://www.microsoft.com/mobile/downloads/developer/poomsdk.asp

3. How to install and register the POOM SDK on a device.

  Once the POOM SDK has been downloaded, run the pimstore.exe file to extract
  its contents. To use the POOM, you need to install and register
  "pimstore.dll" on your Windows CE Companion device. The DLL for each CPU is
  copied to your PC when you download and run the self-extracting .exe file.
  The DLLs are distinguished by name; for example, pimstore_sh3.dll supports
  the SH3 processor. To use POOM, drag the "pimstore_*.dll" for your CPU to the
  \Windows directory of your companion device. Rename the DLL to "pimstore.dll"
  without the underscore and CPU designation.

  You'll need to register the pimstore.dll on the device. This can be
  accomplished in a couple of different ways including running regsvr.exe on
  the device as follows:

	\windows\regsvr.exe \windows\pimstore.dll

  If your device does not have a regsvr.exe utility, a third-party registry tool
  is available from: http://www.cega dgets.com/files/controls/regsvr2.zip

  Another alternative is to compile the sample code that is listed in the POOM
  SDK ReadMe.txt file.
4. Emulation.

  The POOM SDK does not support Windows CE emulation at this time.
5. An overview of the POOM.

  The Pocket Outlook Object Model is modeled after the Outlook 97 and 98 Object
  Models on the desktop. In order to provide a smaller DLL more suited for
  Windows CE devices, POOM is a smaller subset of the desktop Outlook Object
  Model.

  The Pocket Outlook Object Model meets the following goals:

  1. Backward compatibility. The component runs on H/PC 2.0, H/PC 3.0, and P/PC
     1.0, allowing applications to be written for those devices. To achieve
     this, the component exists on top of existing components that haven't
     changed since H/PC 2.0.

  2. Future extensibility. The interfaces are designed to be extensible in the
     future. For example, there is a Folder object, which in this version is
     little more than a wrapper around a database. Because of the first goal,
     you cannot create or otherwise manipulate these folders, but that is
     something that could be allowed in future versions.

  3. Outlook compatibility. Although based on the desktop edition of the
     Outlook Object Model, there are some differences that exist to achieve
     simplicity on the device. For example, a NameSpace object is not provided,
     which Outlook uses to log on to a MAPI session, and which would just be an
     extra layer on Windows CE devices. It would be more accurate to say that
     the Pocket Outlook Object Model is based on the desktop Outlook Object
     Model rather than to say it is a subset of the model.

  4. Automation object. In order to allow Visual Basic and scripting
     programmers the ability to use the Object Model, it has an automation
     object with a dual interface. Although the method and property names are a
     little more complicated in C or C++ than they are in Visual Basic, this
     was an important trade-off for customers.

  5. Simplicity. The interfaces are meant to be quite simple, and as such,
     represent a small subset of the desktop Outlook Object Model
     functionality.

  The main interface to the Pocket Outlook Object Model is the Pocket Outlook
  Application object. It is from this object that all other objects are
  derived. After logging on to the Application object, you can access various
  Folder objects.

  A Folder object contains a collection of Items. This folder implementation is
  a subset of Outlook's Folder object. The Folder object is a wrapper for the
  Contacts, Clock, Calendar, and Tasks databases. There is only one folder for
  each type of item. The Folder object itself cannot be created or otherwise
  manipulated. The Folder object is provided mainly for compatibility with
  Outlook. An Infrared Folder is also provided, which you can use to send items
  over an IR port.

  From the Folder object, you get the Items collection. An Items collection is,
  as the name implies, a collection of Contacts, Tasks, Appointments, or
  Cities. From an Items collection, you can retrieve or create individual
  items. The Items collection also allows you to do basic filtering over a
  collection of objects.

  With an individual Item, you can set and retrieve individual properties. You
  can create, modify, or delete an item in the store. Note that Cities are
  read-only items and cannot be created or modified.

  Task and Appointment items support the RecurrencePattern object. The
  RecurrencePattern object lets you set up a recurrence for a task or
  appointment. Appointments also support the Recipients collection, which
  allows you to specify recipients for a meeting. If an appointment has a
  recipients collection, it is a meeting request.

  The following table represents the basic Pocket Outlook Object Model:

  +--------------------------------------------------+
  | Application Object |               |          |  | 
  +--------------------------------------------------+
  |                    | Folder Object |          |  | 
  +--------------------------------------------------+
  |                    |               | Calendar |  | 
  +--------------------------------------------------+
  |                    |               | Cities   |  | 
  +--------------------------------------------------+
  |                    |               | Contacts |  | 
  +--------------------------------------------------+
  |                    |               | Infrared |  | 
  +--------------------------------------------------+
  |                    |               | Tasks    |  | 
  +--------------------------------------------------+

  reference to the DLL in order to utilize Intellisense Help. To do this, from
  the Project menu, select References and browse until you find the
  pimstore_i486.dll file that shipped with the POOM.

   - How to log on and log off.

     Logon and Logoff should be the first and last things called, respectively,
     on a Pocket Outlook Application Object. Logon logs the user onto a Pocket
     Outlook session and Logoff logs the user out.

     These methods are simply called as follows:

  Option Explicit
  Dim pOLA As PocketOutlook.Application
  Private Sub Form_Load()
  		Set pOLA = CreateObject("PocketOutlook.Application")
  		'Since you are going to be displaying items, you pass in the
   
  'form's HWND to Logon so that dialog boxes will be parented to 'this window. Otherwise, the user could go and display 'multiple items at a time.
  		pOLA.Logon (Form1.hWnd) 'logs on to a session
  End Sub
  Private Sub Form_Unload(Cancel As Integer)
   
  		pOLA.Logoff    'logs off of a session
  End Sub

  		pOLA.Logon (Form1.hWnd)
  		AddNewContact "Maxwell", "Smart"
  End Sub
  Function AddNewContact(sFirstName As String, sLastName As String) As Long Set pContact = pOLA.CreateItem(olCreateContact)
  		pContact.FirstName = sFirstName
   
  		pContact.LastName = sLastName
  		pContact.Save
  		Set pContact = Nothing
  End Function
  Private Sub Form_Unload(Cancel As Integer)

  		GetContacts List1
  End Sub
  Private Sub GetContacts(lstCtrl As ListBox)
  		Dim i As Integer
   
  		lstCtrl.Clear
  'Add all the Contacts to a ListBox. Start by getting the
  'Contacts folder, and then get its Item Collection.
  		Set pItems = pOLA.GetDefaultFolder(olFolderContacts).Items
  		For i = 1 To pItems.Count

   - How to add a city. Cities exist in the World Clock Control Panel applet
     and can be either userdefines or in ROM. In ROM, cities cannot be
     modified.

     When setting either the Longitude ot Latitude properties of the City
     object, use the following standards:
      - West is negative, East positive:

        For example, 104.98 degrees W would be -10498.

      - South is negative, North positive:

        For example, 39.77 degrees N would be 3977.

     Note that before running this code, you should close the 'World Clock'
     Control Panel applet. Otherwise an error results.
