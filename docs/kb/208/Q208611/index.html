-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Urban Assault, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Urban Assault, you may receive an error message similar to the
following while Setup attempts to install the movie player:

  Rundll32 caused a Stack Fault in module Oleaut32.dll.

When you click Close, the installation program continues to run.

You may also receive this error message when you manually run the DirectX Media
installation program (Dxmedia.exe) from the Urban Assault CD-ROM.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if outdated ActiveMovie, DirectShow, or DirectX Media
files are installed on your computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, remove the outdated ActiveMovie, DirectShow, or DirectX
Media files, and then reinstall DirectX Media from the Urban Assault CD-ROM. To
do this, follow these steps:

1. Verify that Windows Explorer is configured to show all files. To do this,
  follow these steps:

  a. Double-click the My Computer icon on the desktop.

  b. On the View menu, click Options or Folder Options.

  c. On the View tab, click Show All Files, and then click OK.

2. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

3. In the Named box, type "actmovie.exe amovie.ocx quartz.dll" (without the
  quotation marks), and then click Find Now.

4. In the list of found files, right-click the Actmovie.exe file, and then click
  Delete. When you are prompted to confirm the file deletion, click Yes. Repeat
  this step to delete all copies of the Actmovie.exe, Amovie.ocx, and
  Quartz.dll files in the list of found files.

5. Close the "Find: Files Named Actmovie.exe Amovie.ocx Quartz.dll" window.

6. Insert the Urban Assault CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive. Press and hold down
  the SHIFT key as you insert the CD-ROM to prevent the program from starting
  automatically.

7. Click Start, and then click Run.

8. In the Open box, type the following line, and then click OK

  &lt;cd-rom&gt;:\Directx\Dxmedia\Dxmedia.exe

  where &lt;cd-rom&gt; is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive that contains the
  Urban Assault CD-ROM.

9. Follow the instructions on the screen to reinstall DirectX Media.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft Urban Assault,
version 1.0.
