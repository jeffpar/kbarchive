-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Mandatory user-based or user group-based advertisements may not run immediately
after a user logs on. Depending on the "Refresh interval" value that is defined
by the Systems Management Server (SMS) administrator, it may take several
minutes for advertisement to be offered to a user. Additionally, if the
advertisement is configured to run when the user logs on, the advertisement
might not run until the user logs on for the second time.

CAUSE
=====

Advertised Program Monitor (Smsmon32.exe) starts the Offer data providers when a
user logs on only if that user has previously defined a custom "Refresh
interval" value for the Offer data providers that is different from the value
that is defined in the system-wide site settings.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English post-Service Pack 3 (SP3) version of this fix should have the
following file attributes or later:

contains the above files may also contain additional files.



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you can define a custom refresh interval in
Advertised Programs Monitor, or you can run the CLIUTILS.EXE /Start "WNET User
Groups Offer Data Provider" command in the user's logon script (or by some other
automated method), to force the Offer data provider to start when a user logs
on.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
the Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4 Hotfix Rollup Package (HRP).

MORE INFORMATION

How to Install the Hotfix
-------------------------

How to Use the Hotfix Installer:

NOTE: You can use this method only on Intel-based computers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a share on your network. Note that
  Q311462.exe is a Microsoft SMS Installer file that updates specific files on
  your site server.

2. Log on to the site server by using an account with administrative
  permissions.

3. On the site server, quit the SMS Administrator console.

4. Run the Q311462.exe tool and then follow the instructions in the wizard. You
  can run the file in Quiet mode by using the /s switch.

How to Install the Hotfix Manually:

1. Stop the SMS_EXECUTIVE and the SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER services.

2. Replace the Clicore.exe and Ccmcore.exe files in the
  &lt;Sms_root&gt;\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the
  version from the hotfix.

3. Replace the Apasetup.exe file in the
  &lt;Sms_root&gt;\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\smsapm32\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with
  the version from the hotfix.

4. Replace the Swdist32.exe file in the
  &lt;Sms_root&gt;\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\SWDist\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the
  version from the hotfix.

5. Replace the Compver.ini file in the &lt;Sms_root&gt;\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base
  folder with the Compverbase.ini file from the hotfix. Rename the
  Compverbase.ini file to Compver.ini when you do this.

6. Replace the Compver.ini file in the
  &lt;Sms_root&gt;\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\smsapm32 folder with the
  Compversmsapm32.ini file from the hotfix. Rename the Compversmsapm32.ini file
  to Compver.ini when you do this.

7. Replace the Compver.ini file in the
  &lt;Sms_root&gt;\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\swdist folder with the Compverswdist.ini
  file from the hotfix. Rename the Compverswdist.ini file to Compver.ini when
  you do this.

8. Replace the following files in the &lt;Sms_root&gt;\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt;
  folder with the versions from the hotfix:

  Bindclin.dll
  Ccim32.dll
  Clisvcl.exe
  Cqmgr32.dll
  Mslmclin.dll
  Ndsclin.dll
  Odpsys32.exe
  Odpusr32.exe
  Smsapm32.exe

9. Restart the SMS_EXECUTIVE and the SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER services. Let
  the updated Compver.ini, Clicore.exe, and Ccmcore.exe files be propagated to
  all logon points and client access points in the site.
