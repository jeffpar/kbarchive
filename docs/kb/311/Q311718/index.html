SUMMARY
=======

SNA Server and Host Integration Server (HIS) 2000 clients display pop-up error
dialog boxes when SnaBase detects various errors. For example, if SnaBase is
unable to open a sponsor connection to an HIS 2000 server, the following pop-up
error dialog box will be displayed:

  Host Integration Server - ERROR # 1003

  SnaBase could not open a sponsor connection to server &lt;server name&gt;

These SnaBase error dialogs cannot be suppressed on SNA Server and HIS 2000
clients.

After you apply the update, all SnaBase popup error dialog boxes can be
suppressed by adding a registry entry, as follows.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

3. From the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry
  value:

  Value name: Quiet

  Value data: YES

If this key is not added prior to initializing SnaBase for the first time on an

location:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/SnaBase/Parameters

4. Quit Registry Editor.
