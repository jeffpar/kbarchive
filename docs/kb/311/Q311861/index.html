IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to open the Internet Service Manager snap-in locally on a computer
that is running Microsoft Windows 2000 server, you may receive the following
error message:

  Unable to enumerate web sites because the following error occurred: An
  internal error occurred.

No error appears in the event log when this occurs, and you can connect from
another computer to this server without error.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if a registry key exists that modifies the default behavior
of the cryptography application programming interfaces (APIs). In this case, the
cryptography APIs cannot create the public and private encryption keysets that
are necessary to query the metabase.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, click Run, and then type "regedit" (without the quotation marks)
  to start Registry Editor.

2. Browse to the following registry key, and then click Providers:

  HKEY_USERS\Default\Software\Microsoft\Cryptography\Providers\Type 001

3. On the Registry menu, click Export Registry File, and then type the location
  in which you want to save this file. You can use this file if you must
  restore this registry key later.

4. Press DELETE, and then click Yes to confirm that you want to delete the
  registry key.

5. Restart the server.


MORE INFORMATION
================


To obtain a more descriptive error message for this problem, log on to the
computer with an account that is currently experiencing the problem.

The following is a test to determine if the account can successfully query the
metabase:

1. Open a command prompt and change to the C:\Inetpub\Adminscripts folder.

2. At the command line, type "cscript adsutil.vbs enum w3svc" (without the
  quotation marks). If this command is successful, it enumerates the settings
  for the w3svc key in the metabase. If the command is not successful, you
  receive the -2146893792 (0x80090020) error code.
