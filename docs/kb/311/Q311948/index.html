SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA LU6.2 Resync TP service (Resyncsvc.exe) fails to start on a Host
Integration Server (HIS) 2000 server that is operating in client mode when
configured to connect to an SNA Server 4.0 system. In addition, the following
event will be logged in the Application Event Log on the HIS 2000 system:

  Event ID: 131
  Source: SNA LU6.2 Resync TP
  Description: (131) The Resynchronization Service was unable to initialize
  interfaces to the WMI Provider.

  EXPLANATION
  The Resynchronization Service encountered HRESULT 8004100E when trying to
  obtain SNA configuration information from the Host Integration Server WMI
  namespace. The service is unable to initialize its environment and prepare
  for transactions. This may indicate that the primary SNA configuration server
  or other SNA server service has become inactive or unreachable on the
  network, or that the Host Integration Server was not installed properly.

The HRESULT listed in the explanation of the Event 131 may vary. The following
are common HRESULT errors that may be returned:

- 8004100E - WBEM_E_INVALID_NAMESPACE

- 80040154 - REGDB_E_CLASSNOTREG

CAUSE
=====

The SNA LU6.2 Resync TP in HIS 2000 needs to read the HIS 2000 configuration
file (COM.cfg) to determine which Advanced Program-to-Program Communications
(APPC) Logical Units (LUs) are configured for SyncPoint support. The SNA LU6.2
Resync TP is designed to use Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to read
the HIS 2000 configuration.

SNA Server 4.0 (and earlier) does not support WMI, so the SNA LU6.2 Resync TP is
unable to read an SNA Server 4.0 configuration to obtain the APPC LU information
that it requires. This results in the Event 131 and the service's failure to
start.

This behavior is by design since SNA Server 4.0 and ealier do not support WMI.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design because SNA Server 4.0 (and earlier) does not support
WMI.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SNA LU6.2 Resync TP service works with Distributed Transaction Coordinator
(DTC) to perform automatic recovery to a consistent state in the face of
failures at any point in a two-phase commit (2PC) transaction.

The SNA LU6.2 Resync TP service is installed by default when an HIS 2000 Server
is installed. This service is not available when you install either the HIS 2000
End-User Client or the HIS 2000 Admin Client.

An HIS 2000 Server can be installed in client (or "Nodeless") mode if the SNA
Service component under "SNA Application Support" is deselected during the
installation process. The SNA LU6.2 Resync TP service is still installed when
you are installing HIS 2000 Server in client mode.

When HIS 2000 Server is installed in client mode, the SNA Resource Location
Wizard will be presented at the end of the installation process to allow the HIS
2000 Server in client mode to be configured to locate an HIS 2000 or SNA Server
server. If the HIS 2000 server in client mode is configured to connect to an SNA
Server 4.0 system, the SNA LU6.2 Resync TP service will fail to start as
described previously.
