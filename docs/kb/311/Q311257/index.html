-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Network Discovery method in Systems Management Server
(SMS) 2.0 and Remote Client Installation with the "Topology, client, and client
operating systems" Network Discovery option is turned on, computers may be
discovered, but may not be installed. The following entry in the NetDisc.log
file may show that Network Discovery could not connect to the computer to
determine the operating system name and version:

  ADM: NtBrowser: Failed to create an anonymous connection to device computer
  name due to insufficient access.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur if anonymous connections are turned off on the discovered
computer.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, turn on anonymous connections, either manually
through the registry, or by using a group policy.

Registry Method
---------------

For additional information manual configuration of anonymous connections by using
the registry, click the article numbers below to view the articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q143474 Restricting Information Available to Anonymous Logon Users

  Q246261 How to Use the RestrictAnonymous Registry Value in Windows 2000

Group Policy Method
-------------------

For group policies that are defined at either the local, site, domain, or
organizational unit level, either turn off or change the setting to "None. Rely
on default permissions" in the Group Policy editor under:

  Computer Configuration \ Windows Settings \ Security Settings \ Local
  Policies \ Additional restrictions for anonymous connections

RESOLUTION

This problem has been corrected in the fix that is described in the following
Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q312512 SMS: Network Discovery Cannot Connect Anonymously to Client After
  Remote Client Installation

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SMS Network Discovery uses an anonymous connection to determine what operating
system and version a computer has. SMS Network Discovery does not use the SNMP
SysDescr value, it makes an RPC call even if SNMP is turned on. If SMS Network
Discovery cannot determine the operating system, it cannot write that property
to the resulting Discovery Data Record (DDR). Because SMS Discovery Data Manager
(DDM) only writes Client Configuration Requests (CCRs) for computers that are
running Microsoft Windows NT, Microsoft Windows 2000, or Microsoft Windows XP,
DDM is designed to not create CCRs unless it can determine the operating system
from the DDR.
