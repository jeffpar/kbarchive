SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the post-Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6a (SP6a) Security Rollup
Package (SRP) on a Hewlett-Packard computer with Hewlett-Packard NTLock
installed, you may receive any of the following error messages when you reboot
the computer:

  STOP c000021a

  winlogon.exe - DLL Initialization Failed
  Initialization of the dynamic link library C:\WINNT\System32\HPSmartF.dll
  failed. The process is terminating abnormally.

  HPolLock.exe - DLL Initialization Failed
  Initialization of the dynamic link library C:\WINNT\System32\HPSmartF.dll
  failed. The process is terminating abnormally.

  WIxInitialize
  HP Gina specific initialization failed: Disable ALL HP Lock features.

If you uninstall NTLock properly before you install the SRP, the computer boots
correctly and remains stable. However, the HPGate service does not start
properly and you receive repeated "failed service" notifications every time you
start the computer. If you then install the latest NTLock software, the computer
does not boot properly and you may receive any of the error messages.

CAUSE
=====

The SRP exposes an issue with Hewlett-Packard Entlk 2.2a and earlier versions of
NTLock (Hpgate.sys) that is available from any of the following Hewlett-Packard
sources:

- The Hewlett-Packard Web site: Hewlett-Packard NTLock Software and Drivers
  (http://www.support.vectra.hp.com/vectrasupport/indexes/Driver622.html)

- The Hewlett-Packard recovery CD-ROM

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this problem from occurring, use these steps:

1. If Hewlett-Packard TopTools is installed, make sure that you have installed
  the latest version. The latest versions of TopTools (TopTools 5.0 and 5.5)
  are available from the following Hewlett-Packard Web site:

  http://www.hp.com/toptools/

2. If TopTools is not installed, install the updated version of NTLock before
  you install the SRP. The updated version of NTLock is available from the
  following Hewlett-Packard Web site:

  http://www.support.vectra.hp.com/vectrasupport/indexes/Driver622.html
