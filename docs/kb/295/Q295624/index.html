The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP6a 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0, 4.0 SP6a 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP6, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to print a document that contains far eastern extended characters
from US Microsoft Office 2000 PowerPoint to an HP PostScript printer, you may
see a blue screen with a "stop error 0x00000050" or "stop error 0x00000019"
message displayed on the screen. The parameters of the stop code may vary in
either case.

This specific error only occurs if the document that you are trying to print
contains exended characters, such as the degree symbol or the plus or minus
symbol from the far eastern font MSP Gothic, and you are trying to print to a
PostScript printer on a computer that is running a US version of the Windows
operating system.

The far eastern font MSP Gothic is only available as part of a far eastern
operating system installation and you cannot install it on US Windows-based
computers.

CAUSE
=====

This issue is caused by an overwrite in pool memory. The overwrite occurs
because the printer driver does not correctly render the far eastern characters
into PostScript code for printing.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, contact the vendor of the printer for an updated
PostScript printer driver.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, use the appropriate method.

To Print the Document a Single Time
-----------------------------------

1. In the program from which you are trying to print, on the File menu, click
  Print.

2. On the Paper\Quality tab, click Advanced, and then expand PostScript Options.

3. Click the TrueType Font Download option, and then change the setting to
  Bitmap. Click Ok to close the window. This changes the print settings for
  this document only so that you can print the document.

To Change This Setting Globally
-------------------------------

To change this setting globally for all documents in a terminal server
environment:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Right-click the PostScript printer that is causing this issue to occur, and
  then click Document Defaults.

3. On the Advanced tab, expand Document Options, and then expand PostScript
  Options.

4. Click the TrueType Font Download option, and then change the setting from
  Automatic to Bitmap. Click Ok to close the window.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The methods that are described in the "Workaround" section of this article do
not work for printing documents that contain standard fonts, such as Arial.
These fonts are substituted for a printer font from the printer font cartridge.
For documents that contain TrueType fonts that have no printer font
substitution, there is a slight increase in the size of the spool file.
