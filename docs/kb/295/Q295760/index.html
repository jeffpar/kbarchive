The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the final field to host is variably sized setting is used in a COM
Transaction Integrator (COMTI) CICS LINK component and the final field is a
string, COMTI incorrectly sends the final field to the host system padded with
NULL characters (0x00) up to the defined maximum size of the field. The expected
behavior is for COMTI to send the final field without padding, sending only the
string passed to the method of the COMTI component
