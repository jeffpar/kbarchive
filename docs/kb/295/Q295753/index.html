SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the directory synchronization (dirsync) process between
Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 and Lotus cc:Mail.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Exchange Server uses directory synchronization to share address
information with other messaging systems. You may have to periodically
synchronize the Exchange Server and Lotus Notes directories to make sure that
messages are delivered successfully in each environment.

Any changes or updates to addresses in either system are synchronized at
predetermined times that are set on the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus
Notes. After directory synchronization occurs, the address lists from both
systems are adjusted to reflect any changes that occurred since the time of the
last directory synchronization cycle.

The dirsync process between Exchange Server 5.5 and Lotus cc:Mail proceeds as
follows:

1. The directory, mailing lists, and bulletin boards from the connecting cc:Mail
  post office are exported in the form of the following files:

  Directory = Export\Ccmdir.exp
  Mailing Lists = Export\Ccmlist.exp
  Bulletin Boards = Export\Ccmbb.exp

2. Exchange Server parses the Ccmdir.exp file, and then calculates the number of
  Exchange Server and cc:Mail entries that are retrieved from the directory.

NOTE: Exchange Server receives all directory data, not only new items, from
cc:Mail during the dirsync process.

3. Exchange Server parses the Ccmlist.exp file, and then calculates the number
  of cc:Mail mailing lists.

4. Exchange Server parses the Ccmbb.exp file, and then calculates the number of
  cc:Mail bulletin boards.

5. Exchange Server searches through its directory, and then prepares a cc:Mail
  Import file.

6. Exchange Server compares the Import file that it created with the information
  that is extracted from the cc:Mail post office, and then determines the
  changes that are required.

  NOTE: The data that is marked for deletion is written to the Import\Ccmdel.imp
  file. Data that is marked for addition is written to the Import\Ccmdir.imp
  file.

7. Exchange Server imports the Ccmdel.imp to the cc:Mail post office, and then
  deletes the Exchange Server entries that are marked for deletion.

  NOTE: If there are no restrictions listed on the Import Container tab in the
  "Connector for Lotus cc:Mail Properties" dialog box, only new deletions are
  imported. However, some restrictions may indicate that dirsync may import
  more data than new deletions only.

8. Exchange Server imports the Ccmdir.imp file to the cc:Mail post office, and
  then adds new Exchange Server entries to cc:Mail.

  NOTE: If there are no restrictions listed on the Import Container tab of the
  "Connector for Lotus cc:Mail Properties" dialog box, only new data is
  imported. However, some restrictions may indicate that dirsync may import
  more data than new entries only.

9. Dirsync then updates the Exchange Server directory by making the correct
  additions and deletions.

10. Dirsync updates the cc:Mail mailing lists and bulletin boards in the
  Exchange Server directory.
