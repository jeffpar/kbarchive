The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft BackOffice Server 4.5 Resource Kit utilities, Preinst.exe and
Delgrp.exe, may return errors when they are run on Systems Management Server
(SMS) running Microsoft SQL Server 2000.

When you attempt to run the Delgrp.exe utility with a SQL Server 2000 database,
you may receive the following error message:

  Cannot get SQL connection.

When you attempt to run the Preinst.exe utility (which is included with SMS 2.0
Support Tools), you may receive the following error message:

  Cannot connect to the SQL server.

If you have enabled the Failure Auditing feature for SQL Server 2000, you may
receive the following SQL event in the Application event log:

  18452 : Login failed for user '(null)'. Reason: Not associated with a trusted
  SQL server connection.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because the default client network protocol has been
changed from "Named Pipes" in Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 (and earlier) to "TCP/IP"
in SQL Server 2000.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, change the default SQL network library to "Named
Pipes." For example, start the SQL Server Client Network Utility (from SQL
Server 2000) on the site server from which you are attempting to run either the
Preinst.exe or Delgrp.exe utility.

On the General tab, ensure that "Named Pipes" is listed in the "Enabled protocols
by order" list. Use the arrows that are displayed to move "Named Pipes" so that
it is first in the list.

If you cannot set "Named Pipes" as the primary protocol, make the following
configurations to the SQL Server 2000 and SMS security settings:

1. Configure SMS so that it does not use integrated security.

2. Configure SQL Server 2000 to use "SQL Server and Windows" security.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
