The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience slow DDR processing with a growing Discovery Data Manager
(DDM) backlog.

CAUSE
=====

On Windows NT 4.0 clients that are running RAS, MAC addresses of
00:00:00:00:00:00 are reported as part of the discovery data. As the DDM
sometimes uses the MAC address when it queries the database, NULL MAC addresses
cannot be used to locate a single client as the MAC address should be unique and
not null. DDM copes with this situation with a set of enhanced queries, and this
causes the slow processing.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q288239 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To "clean up" the database after you applying this hotfix, a SQL script that
deletes the rows from the system_mac_addres_ARR that have the
'00:00:00:00:00:00' entries can be used:

  delete from system_mac_addres_ARR where MAC_Addresses0 = '00:00:00:00:00:00'
  go

NOTE: While this hotfix allows DDRs to process more quickly, it does not prevent
the problem from being recreated by the backlogged files. So the script would
have to be run periodically until the backlog of files are processed or the
backlog would have to be removed prior to the initial run. Given that the
problem may be occurring at several sites in a hierarchy, the easiest option is
to run the script periodically until the backlogs are gone.
