SYMPTOMS
========

A Remote Procedure Call (RPC) program may stop working with an attempt to use
memory that has already been freed. When this problem occurs, you may see a call
stack that is similar to:

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because a pointer to memory is being saved in an object
(Object1). Object1 copies the pointer to another object (Object2). Both objects
now have a pointer to the same memory location. Typically, Object1 will set its
pointer to null (thereby releasing ownership of the memory to the second
object). In a low-memory condition, however, Object1 does not release ownership
of the memory that has been shared to Object2. When these objects are destroyed,
they release the memory they point to, in this case causing the same memory
location to be freed twice.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem.
