CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the System and Administrator accounts do not have
sufficient permissions to, or the Administrators group does not have ownership
of, the directory %SystemDrive%\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application
Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Allow the System and Administrator accounts Full Control of the %System
  Drive%\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application
  Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys folder.

2. Allow the Administrators group ownership of these directories.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: The directory above assumes a clean install of Windows 2000. If we have a
computer which was upgraded from Windows NT 4.0 then the directory is as
follows:

  %SystemRoot%\Profiles\All Users\Application
  Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys
