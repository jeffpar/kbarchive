-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you view the properties of a Sender Address on a child site in the Systems
Management Server Administrator console, the properties box incorrectly displays
a known server as (Unknown).

CAUSE
=====

The parent site correctly displays the Sender Address data because it retrieves
the site information from the child site's Site Control File. This file is
received automatically by the parent site as part of the site attachment
process. However, the parent site never sends its Site Control File to the child
site. As a result, the child site never retrieves this data.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, check the Details pane of the Address node, which
correctly displays the complete destination address.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems Management
Server version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To communicate, sites must have one or more senders. The sender itself does not
provide connectivity to a site. Instead, the sender manages the connection,
ensures the integrity of transferred data, recovers from errors, and ends the
connection when it is no longer needed.

For more information on Sender Addresses, please refer to the Systems Management
Server Administrator Guide.
