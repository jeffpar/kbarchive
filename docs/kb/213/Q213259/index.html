The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Running several Crystal Reports at one time may affect performance on your site
server. Monitoring your system with Performance Monitor may show that the
Crystal Reports agent is using an large amount of CPU time. Also, while the
reports are being generated, large files in the systems Temp folder may be
created.

CAUSE
=====

The site may be set up to allow multiple Crystal Reports to be generated at one
time, but it does not have the correct configuration settings to enable this
task.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, follow these steps:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the MaximumLoad value under the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Seagate Software\Crystal
  Info\Sentinel\MaximumLoad

3. Reduce this value to reduce the number of simultaneous reports that can be
  generated at one time.

  Do not set the MaximumLoad value to anything below 1. If your site server is
  capable, increasing this value allows for a greater number of simultaneous
  reports. This option represents the total number of processes that can run
  concurrently on an Info Server computer. The setting by default is 1. The
  setting should be at least 1.

  CAUTION: If this number is set too high, the system cannot multi-process the
  object efficiently. If this number is set below 1 (for example, 0, -1, -2,
  and so forth), no job is ever processed at the Info Server.

4. Click OK to save your change, and then quit Registry Editor.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
