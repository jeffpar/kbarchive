SUMMARY
=======

TimeSmp.exe is a file that demonstrates how to use the high-resolution timer
services provided by the Microsoft Multimedia Windows graphical environment.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  TimeSmp.exe

The timer services provided by Multimedia Windows allow an application to
schedule timed periodic interrupts or one-time interrupt events at a higher
resolution than is available through the standard Windows timer services.

Unlike the Windows timer services, the Multimedia timer services are
interrupt-based. Rather than posting WM_TIMER messages to a message queue, the
Multimedia service calls a specified function at interrupt time. Because the
callback code is accessed at interrupt time, it must adhere to strict
programming guidelines. In particular, only a very limited set of system
function calls may be made, and the callback function must reside in a
fixed-code dynamic-link library (DLL).

The Multimedia timer services are useful for applications that demand
high-resolution timing, such as a MIDI sequencer. For less demanding
synchronization tasks, use the SetTimer function provided by Windows.

The sample application TIMESMP demonstrates using the timer services and a
callback function residing in a fixed code DLL.
