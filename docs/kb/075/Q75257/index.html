SUMMARY
=======

MS-DOS file handles are associated with a PSP (program segment prefix). For an
MS-DOS terminate-and-stay-resident program (TSR) to open and operate on files on
behalf of a Windows-based application, or to share file handles between MS-DOS
TSRs and Windows-based applications, the TSR and application must be operating
with the same PSP. This is possible because every Windows-based application has
an MS-DOS PSP. Therefore, it is simply a matter of ensuring that the
Windows-based application's PSP is the current PSP when the MS-DOS TSR opens or
operates on a file. This article discusses some of the details involved with
this process.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows Kernel creates a unique MS-DOS PSP for every Windows-based
application that is started. The only time that the application's PSP must be
selected as the current PSP is when the application calls MS-DOS. Therefore, an
application cannot assume that its PSP is the current PSP. Listed below are two
ways to have the PSP set so that a TSR can open or operate on a file on the
application's behalf:

1. The Windows-based application performs an MS-DOS call just prior to calling
  the TSR. This MS-DOS call must involve the file system; just retrieving the
  time of day is not enough. One good choice might be Get File Attributes (INT
  21h, function 43h). Another possibility is to open a file. As long as the
  application does not yield [by calling the GetMessage, SendMessage,
  PeekMessage, and so forth functions], the Kernel will set the PSP for the
  MS-DOS call and will not change it. At this point, the application can call
  the TSR secure in the knowledge that the PSP is set correctly.

2. The TSR can set the current PSP using INT 21h, function 50h (the BX register
  is the segment of the new PSP). To do this, it is necessary that either the
  Windows-based application or the TSR determine the PSP for the application.

  The TSR can determine the correct PSP by following these three steps:

  a. Have the application perform an MS-DOS call just prior to the first call
     to the TSR.

  b. Determine the identity of the PSP by calling INT 21h, function 51h (the
     segment of the current PSP is returned in the BX register).

  c. Save this information or return it to the application that will use the
     PSP as a parameter in subsequent calls to the TSR.

  The application can determine the PSP segment by following these three steps:

  a. Call the GetCurrentPDB function to determine its Program Data Base (PDB).
     The PDB is the Windows equivalent of the PSP.

  b. In protected mode, the value returned is a selector. The application must
     determine the segment address to which the selector maps by using the
     GetSelectorBase function.

     Note that the GetSelectorBase function is not documented in the Windows
     Software Development Kit (SDK); however, the function is documented in the
     Windows Device Development Kit (DDK). The

     function returns a LONG which is the linear address of the base. Dividing
     this value by 16 yields a segment value. Because PDBs are allocated using
     the GlobalDOSAlloc function, the linear address is always below 1
     megabyte.

  c. Once the Windows-based application has determined its PSP, specify the PSP
     as a parameter when calling the TSR.

In Windows version 3.1, an installable driver mechanism has been added that
allows for essentially a Windows TSR. An installable driver can be loaded at
boot time or on demand by an application. It receives notifications in real and
standard mode when the user switches away from or back to Windows to allow the
driver to perform clean-up and/or re-initialization operations as necessary. In
all other respects, it is a standard DLL.
