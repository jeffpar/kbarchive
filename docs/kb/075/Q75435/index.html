SUMMARY
=======

The ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) character set
defines a mapping of the letters, numerals, and specified punctuation and
control characters to the numbers from zero to 127. The term "code page" is used
to refer to extensions of the ASCII character set that also map specified
symbols to the numbers from 128 through 255.

This article discusses how Windows deals with code pages and warns against some
of the pitfalls that applications can encounter.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The ANSI (American National Standards Institute) character set maps the letters
and numerals in the same manner as ASCII. However, ANSI does not support control
characters and it maps many symbols, including accented letters, that are not
mapped in standard ASCII. All Windows fonts are defined in the ANSI character
set.

An Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) code page is built into the computer
hardware. There are a number of OEM code pages, each defined for a particular
language. These code pages are referred to by a number; for example, code page
437 is installed in the original IBM PC computer.

MS-DOS uses code pages to change the available character set, depending on user
preference. A code page change is implemented by programming a new character set
into the video display hardware. By changing to the code page for a particular
language, the accented characters appropriate to that language are made
available. Each code page is limited to 256 symbols.

For each code page, MS-DOS maintains a mapping table to map lowercase characters
to and from uppercase. Because all string parameters to MS-DOS (filenames) are
implicitly coded in the current code page, when the table is changed, filenames
that were accessible under one case mapping may not be available under another.
However, the common code pages were designed to combat this problem.

Windows runs as an extension to MS-DOS. There is a mapping layer that translates
between the ANSI character set and an OEM character set. When Windows is
installed, the Setup program determines the installed character set and installs
the corresponding ANSI-OEM translation tables and Windows OEM fonts.

If the user changes the current MS-DOS code page, Windows does not change its
ANSI-OEM mapping tables automatically. It is necessary to run the Windows Setup
program to modify these tables and to load the corresponding fonts.

Windows-based applications must use the Windows functions AnsiToOem() and
OemToAnsi() when transferring information to and from MS-DOS. In addition,
applications must use the correct character set when creating filenames.

There is no one-to-one mapping between the ANSI and OEM character sets. Applying
the AnsiToOem() function followed by the OemToAnsi() function to a given string
will not always result in the original string. A file that has been named with
one of these strings cannot be accessed by any Windows-based application. The
filename must be changed by the user from outside of Windows.

The following two scenarios may have differing results.

SCENARIO 1
----------

A lowercase ANSI string is passed to the AnsiToOem() function. The result is
passed to MS-DOS, which maps the string to uppercase.

SCENARIO 2
----------

An uppercase ANSI string is passed to the AnsiToOem() function. The string is
passed to MS-DOS.

This is caused by the fact that the MS-DOS lowercase to uppercase conversion
mapping and the Windows ANSI case conversion do not match. To avoid this
problem, use the AnsiUpper() function to convert the ANSI string to uppercase
before passing it to the AnsiToOem() function. Also note, this is only a problem
with extended characters. These problems are often overlooked until your
customers call to complain.

Keep in mind that both ANSI and OEM are 8-bit character sets. In applications,
always use the "unsigned char" type instead of "signed char" for character
variables. Problems that result from using "signed char" are very hard to
track.

The SYSTEM.ini file contains entries that relate to code pages. In the [boot]
section, the OEMFONTS.fon line specifies the file that contains the OEM stock
font. In the [keyboard] section, the OEMANSI.bin line specifies the ANSI-OEM
translation table. If this line is blank, Windows uses the default table built
into the keyboard driver. In the [enh] section, the *WOA.fon lines specify the
fonts used in an MS-DOS window at various resolutions.

Windows does not provide any mechanism for an application to work with data that
is not in the current MS-DOS code page, nor does Windows recognize changing the
OEM code page in an MS-DOS window. However, an application is free to provide
its own translation tables and provide a data format that includes the code
page.
