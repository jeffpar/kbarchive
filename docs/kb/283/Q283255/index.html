The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Exchange Server Internet Mail Service, if you click the Connections
tab, and set the Message Delivery option to "Forward all messages to host", if
the Diagnostics Logging level is set to any level other than None for the SMTP
interface events, the following events may be reported in the Event Viewer
application log:

  Event ID: 3010
  Source: MSExchangeIMC
  Type: Warning
  Category: SMTP Interface Events
  Description:
  An attempt to connect to host &lt;domain.com&gt; failed.

  Event ID: 3011
  Source: MSExchangeIMC
  Type: Warning
  Category: SMTP Interface Events
  Description:
  An attempt to connect to host &lt;X.X.X.X&gt; for &lt;domain.com&gt; was
  refused.

All outbound messages that are sent through the Internet Mail Service include the
same domain name that is listed in the event description regardless of the
connection that is being attempted.

CAUSE
=====

When the Internet Mail Service is started, it uses the first outbound mail
message to populate these events. The service then uses that domain as the
default for all mail that is delivered during the session with the relay host.
This procedure decreases the workload of Exchange Server because Exchange Server
does not look at the other outbound mail domains of any subsequent outbound
mail.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, change the Diagnostics Logging level for SMTP
interface events to None.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The domain that is displayed in each of these warning events remains the same
until the Internet Mail Service is stopped and restarted. At that point, the
domain name for the first piece of outbound mail is listed in each new warning
event. This process occurs each time the Internet Mail Service is restarted.
This issue does not interfere with mail flow and can be ignored.

The host Internet protocol (IP) address listed in event 3011 is the address of
the actual host that the Internet Mail Service is trying to connect with. The
domain name should be ignored.

The IP address portion of the event description should be correct for the host
that is responsible for relaying the outbound SMTP mail. To verify the address,
click the Connections tab of the Internet Mail Service.

Event ID 3010 can be caused by the any of the following scenarios:

- There is a name resolution issue to the relay host.

- There are limitations of the relay host, such as inbound connections are
  allowed.

- There is a firewall issue.

To continue troubleshooting, run Telnet to determine if the IP address that is
listed in the event is correct. Next, verify that the IP address has a
functioning SMTP port.

Event ID 3011 can be reported if that relay host is not listening on port 25.

You may also want to filter Event Viewer to display warnings and success audits.
If an event ID 2003 is reported, a connection has been made to that relay host.
If you are experiencing event 2003 in addition to the other events, you may need
to troubleshoot this issue as an intermittent issue. This event can occur if the
maximum number of inbound connections to the relay host has been reached.
