-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you stop the Microsoft Exchange Router for Novell GroupWise program, it can
take up to three minutes to completely stop. During this time the router is
trying to reconnect to the NetWare server.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by a hard-coded time-out routine where the GroupWise
router tries to reconnect to the NetWare server. This routine runs when it fails
to establish a successful connection the first time. After the router is in this
loop, it will ignore the stop command until it wakes up three minutes later.

STATUS
======

Microsoft acknowledges this to be a limitation with the Microsoft Exchange
Router for Novell GroupWise.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are many reasons why the GroupWise router program might be trying to
reconnect to the NetWare server.

Perform the following actions to verify this problem:

1. Confirm that both the user ID and password are correct.

2. Ensure that the NetWare server is up and running.

3. Confirm that there are no network problems between the Exchange Server
  computer and the NetWare server.

Additional query words: stopping, shutting down, gwrouter
