SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, the menu bar command bar has three buttons on
the right side. These buttons are assigned to the following Word macro
commands:

DocClose
DocMinimize
DocMaximize
DocMove
DocRestore
DocSize

When you create a document window, the buttons are transferred to the document
window title bar. To turn off (disable) these buttons, you must modify the
Visual Basic for Applications commands listed above.

To turn off the Close, Size, and Minimize buttons on the menu bar or the document
window title bar, follow these steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Macro, and then click Macros (shortcut keys ALT+F8).

2. In the Macro name box, type "DocClose" (without the quotation marks), and
  then click Create. The Visual Basic Editor window opens, displaying the
  following code:

  Sub DocClose()
     '
     ' DocClose Macro
     ' Prompts to save the document and then closes the active window
     '
     WordBasic.DocClose
  End Sub

3. Type an apostrophe (') at the beginning of each command line in the macro,
  which will remark them out, as in the line below.

    'WordBasic.DocClose

4. Press ALT+F4 to close the Visual Basic Editor. You have now turned off the
  DocClose command in Word.

Repeat the above steps for the other commands (listed in the "Symptoms" section)
that you want to turn off.

To return to the default Word functionality, you must delete the name of the
function you turned off on the menu bar in the Macros dialog box.
