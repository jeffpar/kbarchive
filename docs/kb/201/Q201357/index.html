The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing a run-time application on a computer, you may receive
the following error message:

  Setup could not write to the file: '&lt;C:\Windows\System&gt;\Wininet.dll'.
  This file is currently being used by another application. Close any open
  applications.

or

  Setup could not write to the file: '&lt;C:\Windows\System&gt;\Urlmon.dll'.
  This file is currently being used by another application. Close any open
  applications.

You then have the following options: Retry, Abort, and Ignore. The path to the
files will be specific to your computer's Microsoft Windows System path.

CAUSE
=====

The run-time application that you are installing contains a newer version of one
or both of the files, Urlmon.dll or Wininet.dll. The Setup program always tries
to overwrite older copies of files on a system that it is installing the files
onto. The Setup program will not be able to successfully overwrite these files
if the files are locked by the Windows operating system.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can change the version of the Urlmon.dll and Wininet.dll files that are
included in your disk images by changing an entry in two of the Setup Wizard
tables.

For information about how to make these changes, see "Solution 3" in the
following article:

  Q174508 ODE: Installing Run-Time Application Breaks Microsoft Internet
  Explorer 3.x

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

At the time of this writing, if you click Ignore in the error message box, your
application is successfully installed without any side effects to Microsoft
Internet Explorer 4.0. However, Microsoft still recommends that you use the
resolution described in the "Resolutions" section to resolve the error message
completely.
