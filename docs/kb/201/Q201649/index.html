SUMMARY
=======

This article covers some of the most frequently asked questions (FAQ) about
Visual Basic and Visual SourceSafe integration.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Q. Where is the main copy of the Visual Basic project stored?

  A. The main copy of the project is located in the Visual SourceSafe database.
  After modifying their local copies, all users should check the files into
  Visual SourceSafe. This will cause the latest version of the user's work to
  be stored in Visual SourceSafe. Every time you open the Visual Basic project,
  Visual Basic will use the information in the local Mssccprj.scc file to
  retrieve the latest version of the files from Visual SourceSafe and replace
  the local copies of the user's Visual Basic files.

2. Q. If the Allow Multiple Checkouts option is enabled, what type of files can
  I allow multiple users to check out simultaneously?

  A. Binary files cannot be checked out by multiple users simultaneously. Forms,
  User Controls, and Property pages are added to Visual SourceSafe as binary
  files. However, Project files, Modules, Class Modules, and User Connections
  can be checked out by multiple users at the same time.

3. Q. How do I know that a file has been Checked Out by some other user?

  A. From Visual Basic, select the file in the project window for which you want
  to know the status, then click on Tools-&gt;SourceSafe-&gt;SourceSafe
  Properties-&gt;Check Out Status tab. You will get the following information:
  Which users have the file checked out, Check Out Date and time, Computer name
  that the file was Checked Out to and the Visual SourceSafe project that
  contains this file.

4. Q. If two users check out a project file, how does Visual SourceSafe avoid
  overwriting changes made by one user when the other user checks in their copy
  of the file?

  A. Let us assume that UserA and UserB checked out the same project file,
  Proj1.vbp. UserA changes the file and checks it in. This will update the file
  stored in the Visual SourceSafe database. UserB changes their local copy of
  the file and checks it in. Before updating the server copy, Visual SourceSafe
  will compare the files in UserB's working folder and the file stored in the
  Visual SourceSafe database. If UserA and UserB have made different changes to
  the same parts of the vbp file, Visual SourceSafe will display the Visual
  Merge window and give UserB the opportunity to specify which changes he or
  she wants to keep.

5. Q. If new users want to modify the project, what are the steps they need to
  follow?

  A. Follow the steps given in the "Creating local copy of the Project from
  SourceSafe" section. This will create a local copy of the project from Visual
  SourceSafe database.

6. Q. While trying to modify a user control after doing a checkout, it gives an
  error "Can't edit module." How can I fix this error?

  A. You will get this error if do not have the form that contains the user
  control checked out. You can avoid this error by checking out the form prior
  to editing the user control.

7. Q. Is it necessary to check out the project file when I only want to edit one
  of the forms contained in the project file?
  A. If you have a ActiveX control embedded in your form, you have to check out
  the project file also.

8. Q. I've checked out and modified my files. At what point do the copies stored
  in the Visual SourceSafe database get updated?

  A. The copies of the files stored in the Visual SourceSafe database only get
  updated when you check your files back in. This causes the changes you've
  made to your local copy of the file transferred to the file stored in Visual
  SourceSafe.

9. Q. When I open a project in Visual Basic that is under Source Code control,
  does Visual SourceSafe get the latest version of the project?

  A. In order to get the latest version of your project from Visual SourceSafe,
  you need to set the Tools-&gt;SourceSafe-&gt;Options-&gt;'Get the latest
  checked-in version while opening the Visual Basic project' option to Yes.
