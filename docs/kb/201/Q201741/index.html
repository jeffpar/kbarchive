SUMMARY
=======

For the same piece of code, a Visual Basic application's behavior can be
different when running as a compiled EXE and when running in debug mode in the
IDE. This article explains the most common reasons why an application's behavior
can be different and recommend ways to handle these situations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Focus issues
------------

This is the most common reason for differences in behavior. While running in
Debug mode, the focus change exists between the forms and Visual Basic IDE, and
such foucs changes are not possible while running as an EXE. In addition, using
message boxes in focus intensive applications will cause huge differences in
behavior between compiled and debug modes.

Recommendations:

- Avoid using message boxes for debug purposes. Use "Debug.Print" statements
  instead. In the compiled EXE, use file input/output for debuging.
- When shifting focus between Visual Basic application and the Visual Basic
  IDE, make sure that the focus stays in the desired location.

Interpreter Vs Compiler issues
------------------------------

When running in Debug mode, the code is interpreted, while in run mode, the code
is compiled and executed. The behavior difference may be because of the
difference in the way the Interpreter and Compiler handle some code.

Recommendations:

- Compile the application in P-code instead of Native code. P-code bahavior is
  similar to that of interpreter while Native code may behave differently.
- If the application is compiled using Native code, use VC++ to debug your
  compiled application. See the first two articles in the REFERENCES section
  for a detailed description.

Issues with yielding to other processes
---------------------------------------

When running in Debug mode and stepping each line of code, the processor gets
enough time to yield to other processes and it is somewhat similar to calling
DoEvents each time you enter into Debug mode. A compiled application may not
yield to the processor at the expected line of code.

Recommendations:

- Put DoEvents before the line where the behavior is different for a compiled
  EXE. This may give the same bahavior as running in Debug mode.
- Avoid putting break points in lines of code, where you do not want to yield
  to other processes. Use Debug.print or file input/output to debug in such
  situations.

Threading
---------

The IDE has only two threads running at a time. A background thread allows Visual
Basic to process the Control-Break while running code that is not yielding time.
To be able to access DataMembers and allow for compile on demand Visual Basic
restricts all components running in Debug mode to a single thread of execution.
This is especially important when debugging ActiveX components. For example,
adding an ActiveX DLL project to a Standard EXE project for debugging may not
work the same as when you debug the EXE using the compiled DLL. This also
effects any programs that depend on name space seperation to function properly.
For example, if you reference a variable defined in a standard bas module, this
variable will be shared across every module running on the same thread. So in
the IDE, if you change this variable in one class other classes will also see
the change. This can lead to the mistaken impression that variables in base
modules are global when they are really only thread global. When your
application runs in compiled mode the variable may no longer be shared. To learn
more about how data is shared in a multithreaded environment, please look for
the topic "Apartment-Model Threading in Visual Basic" in MSDN Help or Books
Online.

Recommendations:

- Use Visual C++ to debug the compiled application. See the first two articles
  in the REFERENCES section for a detailed description.
- In addition to using the VC debugger, you can also debug ActiveX components
  by running the client in one session of the Visual Basic IDE and running the
  server in another session.
- Do not reply on Public variables in standard bas Modules when using multiple
  threads. If you need static shared variables, search MSDN Help, or Books
  Online, for the topic "Static Class Data."

Other Causes:
-------------

Usually, the issues with differences in bahavior can be resolved by following the
recommandations given earlier. You may experience differences due to other
reasons also. Contact developer support at this stage.
