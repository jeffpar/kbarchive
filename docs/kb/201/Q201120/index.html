SYMPTOMS
========

One or more postoffices suddenly disappear from a once fully-functional
Microsoft Mail Connector (MSMC) configuration. When any administrator attempts
to recreate the missing postoffice, an error message states that this postoffice
already exists and can not be recreated.

You may also notice the following error messages in the Windows NT Event Viewer:

  Event ID: 2558
  Source: MSExchangeMSMI
  Category: Session Error
  Type: Error
  Description: The thread in the MSMail connector that delivers to MSMail has
  failed waiting on the MSExchange queue.

  Event ID:2590
  Source: MSExchangeMSMI
  Category: Session error
  Type: Error
  Description: The MSMail connector interchange wait on Exchange queue failed
  0x5

  Event ID: 2550
  Source: MSExchangeMSMI
  Category: Session Error
  Type: Error
  Description: The thread in MSMail connector that delivers to Exchange has
  failed creating MSExchange MTA object. Check that the MSExchange MTA is
  running. When the MSExchange MTA is restarted, the MSMail connector will
  automatically establish a session with it.

CAUSE
=====

When the Microsoft Mail Connector starts, it reads files from the connector
postoffice, &lt;Exchangeservername&gt;\Maildat$, to build what is displayed in
the MSMC. These files are Network.glb and all of the .xtn files. If these files
are corrupted, the MSMC displays incorrect information.

Specifically, if the Network.glb file is corrupted, if a valid postoffice is
changed to indirect by the MSMAIL record, this valid postoffice will not be
displayed in the Microsoft Mail Connector. Additionally, because the record
still resides in the Network.glb file, it cannot be recreated.

RESOLUTION
==========

The best resolution to this problem is to obtain a copy of the Network.glb file
from backup tape. If no changes have been made to the Exchange routing to
Microsoft Mail, this file can be restored by itself. Otherwise, please contact
Microsoft Product Support Services

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Exchange Connector postoffice (shadow postoffice) has a special record in
the Network.glb file. There is an Microsoft Mail network name defined in every
Exchange Connector postoffice. However, this Microsoft Mail network name is not
viewable in the Microsoft Mail Connector. This is one of the differences between
a shadow postoffice and the standard postoffice.
