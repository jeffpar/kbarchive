-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Knowledge Consistency Checker, one of the following pop-up
error messages may be displayed:

  Knowledge consistency has been successfully verified.

  An internal error has occurred during directory replication. Stop and then
  restart the directory service. Then try directory replication again.

  Microsoft Exchange Administrator ID no: c1030b0d

  -or-

  Knowledge consistency has been successfully verified.

  The Knowledge Consistency Checker could not connect to the local directory
  server to start the check. Verify that the directory service is started.

  Microsoft Exchange Administrator ID no: c1030b1f

The following events may also be logged in the Windows NT Application Event log:

  Event ID: 1124
  Source: MSExchangeDS
  Type: Error
  Category: Knowledge Consistency
  Text: The consistency checker encountered an
  internal error and can't continue checking the
  consistency of this directory. Stop and restart
  this Microsoft Exchange Server computer.

  Event ID: 2024
  Source: MSExchangeAdmin
  Type: Warning
  Category: Replication Configuration
  Text: An error was encountered by the knowledge
  consistency checker on server '&lt;server name&gt;'.
  &lt;&lt;0xc1030b0d - An internal error has occurred during
  directory replication. Stop and then restart the
  directory service. Then try directory replication again.&gt;&gt;

CAUSE
=====

The following registry entries do not contain the correct Organization, Site, or
Server Name, respectively:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeSA
  \Parameters\Enterprise

  NOTE: The above registry key is all one path; it has been wrapped for
  readablilty.

  -or-

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeSA
  \Parameters\Site

  NOTE: The above registry key is all one path; it has been wrapped for
  readablilty.

  -or-

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeSA
  \Parameters\Server

NOTE: The above registry key is all one path; it has been wrapped for
readablilty.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, change the registry entries to match the correct
Organization, Site, and Server Names specified in the Microsoft Exchange
Directory and restart the server. To verify the correct Directory Name for the
Organization, Site, and Server, run the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program
in Raw Mode and note the "Directory-Name" attribute in Raw Properties for each
of the three objects.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior can occur if a server is reinstalled with an incorrect
Organization, Site, or Server name, and only the following registry entry has
been corrected rather than performing a reinstallation of the server:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMTA\Parameters\X500DN

The System Attendant may still start, and this behavior may not be otherwise
noticeable.
