The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.2 SP1, 1.2 SP2, 1.2 SP3, 1.2 SP4, 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Systems Management Server 2.0 has the ability to upgrade an operating
system on any client computer just as if it were installing program software
locally to the computer.

One caveat to this statement is that when you are upgrading 16-bit operating
systems such as Microsoft Windows 3.1 or Microsoft Windows for Workgroups to
Microsoft Windows NT, the administrator is responsible for specifying the
network adapter settings during the setup process.

This Windows NT requirement may limit Systems Management Server's ability to
perform an unattended installation. The administrator must specify the interrupt
request line (IRQ) and port address of the network adapter during Windows NT
setup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is generally an issue only when Systems Management Server is used
to upgrade 16-bit operating systems such as MS-DOS or Windows 3.x to Windows NT.
When you are upgrading Microsoft Windows 95 or earlier versions of the Windows
NT operating system to Windows NT, the settings are correctly ported over to the
new operating system.

NOTE: Be sure, when you create any customized scripts for upgrading Windows 3.x
to Windows NT, that they include specific network adapter setup information. For
details on customizing unattended upgrades, refer to the Windows NT Resource
Guide.
