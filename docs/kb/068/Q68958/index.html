You can use the Microsoft Mouse with ACT! version 2.0. In order to use
the mouse correctly, you must first load the generic menu DEFAULT.COM
or MSMENU.COM. Appendix H-1 of the ACT! "Reference Manual" specifies
DEFAULT.COM, but the more current MSMENU.COM or MENU.COM work as well.

Copy one of these files to the ACT! subdirectory. The directions for
ACT! specify that you:

1. Load the mouse.

2. In the subdirectory in which ACT! is installed, type "MSMENU MSACT"
   (without the quotation marks).

3. After the menu is loaded in this way, type "ACT!" (without the
   quotation marks). You will now have the use of the mouse in ACT!

The file MSACT.MSE is a menu file that comes with ACT!. If the mouse
and menu are loaded properly, then the mouse should give basic cursor
movement with the buttons serving the following functions:

   Button                   Function
   ------                   --------

   Left Button Click        Same as ENTER
   Right Button Click       Same as F2 (edit mode)
   Both Buttons Click       Same as ESC

Note: These button assignments may not work properly in DOS 4.00.

If you do not have a copy of MSMENU.COM, you may obtain a copy by
calling Microsoft Customer Service or Product Support and ordering
 "The Microsoft Mouse Supplemental Menus Disk."
