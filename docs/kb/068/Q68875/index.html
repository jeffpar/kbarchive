Although you may have been able to link other programs without a
problem, in certain cases, the link error "L2029: Unresolved External"
may be generated for some of the following symbols:

   __aFlmul
   __aFfalrem
   __aFalshl
   __aFnaldiv

The L2029 error may be occurring because you are using a library that
does not contain all of the necessary functions, due to improper
installation or renaming.

The problem could result because the C compiler was installed without
combined libraries, or because the file

   xLIBCR.LIB

was improperly renamed to the following

   xLIBCE.LIB

(where x = S, M, C or L).

In this case, the linker will incorrectly use xLIBCE.LIB, assuming
that it is a combined library containing all of the necessary
functions.

To resolve the problem, reinstall the C run-time libraries by typing
"setup /lib" from drive A with the Setup disk loaded. Then choose
"Yes" for "Combined Libraries" when prompted.

Note that this problem may also occur with QuickC versions 2.50 and
2.51.
