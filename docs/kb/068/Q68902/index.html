SUMMARY
=======

There is a new printer driver available for the Panasonic KX-P1124. This driver
was written by Microsoft and is available from Microsoft Product Support Support
Services or from Panasonic.

If you do not have the proper driver, you can use one of the two emulation modes
the printer supports and print using the corresponding Microsoft Windows printer
driver.

1. Epson LQ-2500

   - Epson LQ-2500 Italic

   - Epson LQ-2500 Graphic Set 2

2. IBM Proprinter X24

   - IBM X24 Graphic Set 1

   - IBM X24 Graphic Set 2

The Panasonic KX-P1124 is shipped using the Epson LQ-2500 Italic mode as the
default. This emulation does not support the extended character set (that is,
single and double box outlines, and Greek characters).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following examples explain how to set up the KX-P1124 for the IBM Proprinter
X24 and Epson LQ-2500 emulation modes.

INITIAL SETUP MODE
------------------

To begin selecting the appropriate emulation, perform the following steps to get
into the initial setup mode:

1. Turn the printer off.

2. Press and hold the FUNCTION key on the printer.

3. Turn the printer on.

4. Release the FUNCTION key.

NOTE: The ON-LINE light should begin flashing, indicating that you are operating
in the initial setup mode.

The printer's front panel includes the following arrangement:

               Col1   Col2   Col3   Col4   Col5   Col6
              [LED]  [LED]  [LED]  [LED]  [LED]  [LED]
  Row1 [LED]
  Row3 [LED]
  Row5 [LED]

At this point, Row1 should be lit and one of the LEDs in columns 1 through 4
should be lit. Below is a quick reference to what emulation is active:
