SUMMARY
=======

Under Windows version 3.1, the first time a private profile (.INI file) is
accessed, the system will call the GetFileTime() API and store this value. The
WriteProfileString() API will then call the GetFileTime() API and compare the
return value to the stored value. If the two values match, the file is
considered valid for two seconds. The function makes the changes and writes the
new contents to disk. If the two values do not match, the profile is reread into
a buffer and the change is made. The same principle holds true for reading
values from a private profile.

The reasoning behind the two second limit is that most applications read private
profiles in a burst, at application startup, and write in a burst, at
application shutdown. The penalty of one read in a twenty read sequence is
considered acceptable, given the benefits.

In Windows version 3.0, an application that has a private profile will not
respond to changes made to that private profile by a text editor. When a text
editor updates a private profile, the file on disk is modified. However,
GetPrivateProfileString() and GetPrivateProfileInt() do not read from the disk
file, instead the functions read from a copy of the file in a cache.
WritePrivateProfileString() will update the appropriate sections in both the
cached file and the disk file, however, the functions will not reload the disk
file into the cache unless the entire cache is invalidated. The information
included below discusses how to force a private profile to be recached from a
disk file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows caches .INI files to reduce access time. This design allows the file to
remain in memory until a different .INI file is loaded or until an application
forces recaching of the file.

To force an .INI file to be recached, make the following call (where
&lt;fname.ini&gt; is the name of the application's private profile):

     WritePrivateProfileString(NULL, NULL, NULL, &lt;fname.ini&gt;)

This call will force the entire .INI file that is in the cache to be invalidated.
The next call to either GetPrivateProfileString() or GetPrivateProfileInt() will
cause the disk file to be recached.

While .INI files are cached to optimize access time, the following are examples
of how and when an .INI file could be recached.

1. The application could update the cache from disk each time the application
  requires information from the profile. Calling the WritePrivateProfileString
  function as outlined above would clear the cache.

  NOTE: Because the file is recached with every access, the benefit of the cache
  is lost with this method.

2. Create a separate program or function that the user would invoke to
  explicitly invalidate the cache. The following is some code for that purpose
  that could be placed into the GENERIC sample application supplied with the
  Windows Software Development Kit (SDK):

     BOOL InitInstance(HANDLE hInstance, int nCmdShow)
     {
        LPSTR lpApplicationName, lpKeyName, lpDefault, lpReturnedString;

        int   nSize;

        /* initialize variables */ 
        ...

        WritePrivateProfileString(NULL, NULL, NULL, "MY.INI");
        GetPrivateProfileString(lpApplicationName, lpKeyName,
           lpDefault, lpReturnedString, nSize, "MY1.INI");
        MessageBox(NULL, "Cache Refreshed", szApp,
           MB_ICONINFORMATION | MB_OK);
        return TRUE;
     }

  Using a program or function like this will cause the .INI file to be recached
  only when it is changed by an editor, therefore the benefit of the cache is
  retained. However, it is necessary for the user to call another application
  or function after the profile is changed with an editor.

3. If neither of these techniques is suitable, the application could check the
  time and date stamp on the .INI file before each access to see if cache
  invalidation is necessary. This option provides the benefits of the cache
  without requiring the user to call another program. The overhead required to
  read the time and date stamp is minimal compared to recaching the file with
  every call to either the GetPrivateProfileString or GetPrivateProfileInt
  functions.
