This article gives information about using QuickBASIC version 4.50
with the software Gama Fax CB version 4.3.1 (latest version as of
1/1/91). Gama Fax CB is manufactured by the company Gama Link. This
software operates a fax dispatcher.

Gama Fax CB is a TSR (terminate and stay resident) program that can
interfere with BASIC's keyboard input in key trapping techniques, such
as ON KEY GOSUB and INKEY$. The TSR program slows down BASIC's
keyboard input so that a delay occurs before the input is eventually
read. An explanation and workaround is provided below.

This information applies to Microsoft QuickBASIC versions 2.00, 2.01,
3.00, 4.00, 4.00b, 4.50 for MS-DOS; to Microsoft BASIC Compiler
versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS; and to Microsoft BASIC
Professional Development System (PDS) versions 7.00 and 7.10 for
MS-DOS.

This conflict is due to the operation of the Gama Fax software. Gama
Fax CB runs as a background task that constantly monitors
communications port input while other programs (like QuickBASIC
programs) run in the foreground. This means that the TSR program
competes for processing time with QuickBASIC.

It is possible to control how much background processing time the Gama
Fax software will take. By adjusting this time, you may be able to
correct the problem with BASIC keyboard input. There is a
configuration file called GFAX.$DC that comes with the Gama Fax
software. Inside GFAX.$DC is a line with the statement "GFXSHUTDOWN",
followed by some numbers. After that line, add the following line:

   QUANTUMS number1 number2

This command splits the foreground and background time slices. The
number1 is the number of time ticks assigned to the foreground process
(your BASIC program). The number2 is the number of time ticks assigned
to the background process (the Gama Fax software).

Below are some number combinations that have been successful for other
Gama Fax users:

   QUANTUMS 4 50
   QUANTUMS 2 50     &lt;-- most successful
   QUANTUMS 2 100

Other combinations may work with other machines or other versions of
QuickBASIC. If the above configuration does not solve the problem and
you need more assistance in configuring the Gama Fax software, contact
Gama Link at (408) 744-1430.
