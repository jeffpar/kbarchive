-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows Device Development Kit (DDK) for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The tools and documentation in the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
(SDK) version 3.0 or 3.1 are required to develop a device driver or a virtual
device (including a 386 enhanced-mode virtual device). The documentation for the
Microsoft Windows DDK includes several references to the SDK documentation. The
SDK documentation contains detailed information on the new features supported by
Windows.

For technical assistance while developing a driver or virtual device, contact
Microsoft Product Support Services regarding its Support Premier or Support
Professional services.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following languages, tools, and software are necessary to produce a device
driver or a virtual device for Microsoft Windows version 3.0 or 3.1:

1. Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 5.1 or higher (for all drivers).

2. Microsoft C Compiler version 6.0 or higher (generally used for printer
  drivers).

3. Version 3.0 of the DDK supports the Microsoft C Compiler version 5.1 for
  those developers who have not upgraded to a later version of the compiler or
  who desire to confirm successful DDK installation by building a driver and
  performing a binary comparison with the corresponding driver included in the
  DDK. Version 5.1 of the Microsoft C Compiler is no longer commercially
  available.

4. The tools and files included with the Microsoft Windows DDK and the Microsoft
  Software SDK.

5. The Windows retail product and various applications (for debugging and
  testing). Version 3.1 of the Windows DDK includes display, printer and
  network compatibility tests to assist in debugging a driver.
