SUMMARY
=======

You can have two different instances of a printer driver in the Control Panel of
Microsoft Windows version 3.0. For example, you can have a PostScript driver
configured as a NEC LC 890 on COM2 with legal size paper, and a PostScript
driver configured as a QMS PS-810 on LPT2 with letter size paper.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You may want to have the two printers listed separately so you won't need to
change all printer settings each time you want to send a print job to the other
printer. You can install a second configuration of the same printer as follows:

1. From the Main group of Program manager, choose Control Panel.

2. From Control Panel, choose Printers.

3. From Printers, select the Add Printer option.

4. From the list of printers, choose the new printer desired and select the
  Install option.

5. From the dialog box, choose current printer driver.

6. Configure the new printer for the port, status, and settings desired.

The above process uses the same printer driver file for multiple printer
configurations. You may prefer to have separate printer driver files for each
printer configuration. To do this, create a second copy of the printer driver
under a different name as follows:

1. From the Main group of Program manager, select the MS-DOS prompt.

2. From MS-DOS, change to the SYSTEM subdirectory where the printer drivers is
  located. For example, type "CD\WINDOWS\SYSTEM" (without the quotation marks)
  to change to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.

3. At the MS-DOS prompt, make a copy of your printer driver. For example, "COPY
  PSCRIPT.DRV PSCRIPT2.DRV" (without the quotation marks) will make a copy of
  the PostScript driver file named PSCRIPT2.DRV.

4. Type "EXIT" (without the quotation marks) to return to Windows.

5. In Windows, use a text editor such as Notepad or SysEdit to edit your WIN.INI
  file as follows:

        [PrinterPorts]
        Generic / Text Only=TTY,LPT1:,15,45
        PostScript Printer=PSCRIPT,COM1:,15,45
        Alternate Printer=PSCRIPT2,LPT2:,15,45

        [devices]
        Generic / Text Only=TTY,None
        PostScript Printer=PSCRIPT,COM1:
        Alternate Printer=PSCRIPT2,LPT2:

  Alternate Printer refers to the second copy of the printer driver.

6. Exit Windows and restart it so Windows will reread the WIN.INI file and cause
  these entries to appear in Printer Setup under the Control Panel.

NOTE: Although you can add a different name for a printer driver, you may not see
the expected Setup dialogue box. For example, after adding a name for a
Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet IIIsi PostScript driver, the Apple Laser Writer
Plus Setup dialog box may appear instead of HP's.
