SYMPTOMS
========

In the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) version 1.1, the default build options for
creating a Windows or Presentation Manager DLL will ignore any .RC files
included in the Program List, and therefore, will not build them into the
project.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the following steps to correct this problem:

1. If there is a Program List currently set, clear it.

2. Set the Main Language to C.

3. Set the Initial Build Options to one of the following types of DLLs that you
  desire:

  Windows DLL
  OS/2 Presentation Manager Multithreaded DLL
  OS/2 Presentation Manager Multithreaded DLL, C run time in a DLL

4. Create a new Program List containing all the files you want in your project.

5. Save the Program List. At this point, PWB will tell you that your .RC file
  will be ignored. Choose OK when that dialog box appears.

6. Choose Editor Settings from the Options menu.

7. Find the line that starts:

  build: target $(PROJ).dll

8. Change the word "res_dll" on that line to "rc_dll" (without the quotation
  marks).

9. Move the cursor off that line to highlight the change. Press SHIFT+F2 to save
  the new settings.

10. Press F2 to exit the ASSIGN pseudofile.

11. Choose Edit Program List from the Make menu.

12. Choose Save List. The .RC file will now be saved in the Program List and
  used as expected.

After these steps are taken, the settings will be saved in the .STS file for that
project, and will remain correct as long as Set Initial Build Options is never
selected when this Program List is set. In order to keep from repeating these
steps for future projects, the build options should be saved under a descriptive
name, such as "Corrected Windows DLL Settings." They can then be chosen for any
future DLL building.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Programmer's WorkBench
version 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
as it becomes available.
