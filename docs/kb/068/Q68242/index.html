SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft MS-DOS is not a retail product. Microsoft licenses MS-DOS to original
equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to sell with their computers. This includes the
Microsoft MS-DOS packaged product, which some OEMs bundle with their machines.

Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0 is also licensed to OEMs. Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0 includes a
new installation program designed to set up a brand-new machine. If necessary,
Setup will partition and format the hard disk before installing MS-DOS. When
installing MS-DOS version 5.0 over an earlier version of MS-DOS on a hard disk,
SETUP.EXE will delete the previous MS-DOS files, rename your previous
AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files, and install MS-DOS 5.0, including new
AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files.

Note: This information is based on the Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0 packaged product.
Depending on an OEM's licensing agreement with Microsoft, SETUP.EXE may be
changed by the OEM. For details on a particular OEM's SETUP.EXE, see your MS-DOS
5.0 documentation, or ask your OEM or dealer.

Microsoft is also introducing something new: the Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade.
Unlike Microsoft MS-DOS, the Upgrade is a Microsoft retail product, sold by
Microsoft in the same way as Word or Windows.

Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade is intended for those who have MS-DOS version 2.11 or
later and who want to upgrade their current MS-DOS system to version 5.0.
Because it assumes that you already have an MS-DOS system in place, the
Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade disks are not bootable. The Microsoft MS-DOS 5
Upgrade's SETUP.EXE will upgrade the current MS-DOS system to version 5.0, and
it will not partition, repartition, or format a hard disk while doing so.

Because of the issues involved in upgrading from any OEM's MS-DOS 2.11 (or later)
to MS-DOS 5.0, one of the features of the Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade is the
option to return to the previous version of MS-DOS. Should you decide, for any
reason, to return to the previous MS-DOS system, the UNINSTALL option will allow
you to do so easily.

The differences between Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade and Microsoft MS-DOS 5 are as
follows:

- Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade can be purchased in retail outlets. According to
  Microsoft licensing agreements, MS-DOS can be purchased only with a computer
  from the OEM, or as an upgrade from the OEM.

- The Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade SETUP.EXE program is different from the
  Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0 SETUP.EXE.

- Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade allows you to uninstall and return to the previous
  MS-DOS system.

- Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade disks are nonbootable. Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0, like
  previous versions of MS-DOS, contains a bootable floppy disk.

- Several network redirectors ship with Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade to make it
  easier to upgrade a networked machine.

- Technical support for the Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade is available for the
  first 90 days of product ownership by calling (425) 646-5104. Technical
  support for the OEM version should be obtained from the OEM, or as an
  alternative, from Microsoft at (900) 896-9000.

For more information on installing MS-DOS version 5.0 over a previous version of
MS-DOS, query on the following words:

  "MSDOS" (without the quotation marks) and "5.0" (without the quotation marks)
  and "upgrade" (without the quotation marks) and "OEM" (without the quotation
  marks) and "installation" (without the quotation marks)
