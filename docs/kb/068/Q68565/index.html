SUMMARY
=======

Using dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) is a very flexible way to centralize a body
of program code. Many applications may use functions from a DLL, while only one
copy of the DLL code is in memory. This contrasts with code that is statically
linked into applications, which requires each application to have its own copy
of the shared code.

By default, each DLL has its own data segment, separate from that of the calling
applications. This default behavior precludes using some of the standard
Windows-application programming practices and C run-time functions in a DLL.
This article discusses techniques to ensure that no data segment is created for
a DLL.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The most common reason to use a DLL that does not have its own data segment is
to ensure that the data segment (DS) register and stack segment (SS) register
are the same (DS == SS). A large majority of the functions provided with the C
run-time libraries expect that DS == SS. Functions with this requirement have
been removed from the DLL-specific libraries included with the Windows Software
Development Kit (SDK).

DLLs that have their own data segment will use the stack segment of the
application that calls the DLL. This means that the data segment and stack
segment differ (DS != SS). This fact precludes using many C run-time functions
and any others that require DS and SS to be the same. A DLL without a data
segment will use both the data segment and the stack segment of the calling
application; therefore, DS == SS.

The clarity of the previous discussion is complicated by the fact that some items
within a DLL will declare their own data segment. The DATA statement in the
module definition (.DEF) file is the mechanism that Windows uses to determine if
the DLL has a data segment. If the .DEF file declares DATA NONE, then Windows
will assume that no data segment exists for this DLL. Throughout this
discussion, DLLs with a DATA NONE statement in the appropriate .DEF file will be
called DATA NONE DLLs.

Since Windows assumes that a DATA NONE DLL does not have a data segment, a data
segment that is created implicitly by the DLL code itself is not loaded into
memory and will not be visible by HEAPWALK or other heap management utilities.

When a DATA NONE DLL does have a data segment, the DLL will use the application's
DS as it should; however, the offset into the data segment is then calculated as
being relative to the DLL's data segment. Assigning any value to a variable
declared in the DLL will then overwrite any data in the application's data
segment.

This type of anomaly may be difficult to track down. When the data segment is
built for the DLL, items are placed in the data segment from bottom to top. For
example, one integer variable requires two bytes on the bottom of the DLL's data
segment. Writing to this variable will overwrite 2 bytes on the bottom of the
calling application's data segment. Since the size of an application's data
segment is often many thousands of bytes, this type of error may go unnoticed
and will most likely not cause a general-protection (GP) fault.

These offending data segments are created by the C Compiler to store global and
static variables and static text. One symptom of an unexpected data segment is
that the Resource Compiler provides a warning message similar to the following:

  RC: Warning RW4002: Non-discardable Segment 2 set to PRELOAD

This warning is generated when a data segment has been created by the C Compiler;
however, flags have not been defined for that segment (such as MULTIPLE or
DISCARDABLE). The default setting for these segments is PRELOAD SINGLE.

A DLL that uses the C run-time code references a global internal variable
__acrtused, which is declared as follows in LIBENTRY.ASM:

     extern __acrtused:abs

Referencing this variable informs the linker that the DLL will use the C run-time
code. If the C run-time code is not required by the DLL, this line should be
removed to allow a truly DATA NONE DLL to be created.

If the C run-time code is actually used by the DLL, __acrtused must be declared.
This will cause a data segment to be created; however, the warnings concerning
that data segment may be ignored.

However, if C run-time code is not being used in the DLL, __acrtused can be
removed, and the C run-time code can also be removed from the DLL. The C
run-time code is present in the standard import libraries xDLLCyW (where "x" is
a memory model, and "y" is "E" for emulator math or "A" for alternate math). If
the xNOCRTD libraries are used instead, no C run-time code is linked into the
DLL. In addition to changing the library specification on the LINK command line,
the /NOE option must be specified.

To use the application's DS on a function-by-function basis, the NODATA option
can be used on exports. When the linker fixes up a DLL entry point, it can be
told to omit the code that changes DS on DLL entry. This can be done on a
per-export basis, allowing much greater flexibility because a data segment can
still exist, although it is only only set for certain calls. An example of this
type of EXPORT statement is listed below (fragment of a .DEF file):

     EXPORTS
             MyExportName @145 NODATA

When "MyExportName" is called, it will not have the DS set to the DLL's DS,
instead it will retain the application's DS.
