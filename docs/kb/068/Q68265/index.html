The additional adherence to the ANSI standard beginning with C
versions 6.00 and 6.00a and QuickC versions 2.50 and 2.51 will cause a
negative signed integer to be converted to an unsigned integer in a
comparison. This is the correct and intended behavior, although it may
produce results that are unexpected. The sample code below
demonstrates this behavior.

This is new in C 6.00 and is documented in "Microsoft C Advanced
Programming Techniques" on page 422, section B.1.2. The following
program will produce warning C4018 "signed/unsigned mismatch" at
warning level 3 or 4. Casting of the variables will preserve their
relationship in the expression.

Sample Code
-----------

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void main( void)
{
   int a = -1;
   unsigned b = 1;

   if ( b &lt; a )
      printf( "Signed was converted to unsigned\n");
   else
      printf( "Sign was preserved\n");
}

The output from the program above will be:

   Signed was converted to unsigned

Either of the following methods may be used to achieve the expected
behavior:

1. If you are sure that b is less than 32768, change the if statement
   to:

      if ( (signed int) b &lt;  a)

   Note: This will produce the most efficient code.

2. Change the if statement to:

      if ( (long) b &lt; (long) a)
