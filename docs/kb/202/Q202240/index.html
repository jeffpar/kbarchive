-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Messages from Lotus cc:Mail to Exchange Server may remain queued at the cc:Mail
post office. The following event ID may be generated at the Exchange Server
computer:

  Event ID: 54
  Source: MSExchangeCCMC
  Type: Error
  Category: General
  Conversion of message failed and the message was moved to the Bad directory.

CAUSE
=====

The cc:Mail Export.exe program is not finishing exporting a message with a PC
Paintbrush (PCX) attachment.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. On the Exchange Server computer, check the Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Bad folder. Open
  several of the files located there with Notepad and confirm that they are all
  from the same user (or are copies of the same message).

2. Locate the message in the cc:Mail post office queue that corresponds to the
  files from the Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Bad folder.

3. After you locate the problem message in the queue, forward it to another
  cc:Mail mailbox, and delete it from the cc:Mail post office queue.

4. Restart the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail. The queued
  messages should now be sent from cc:Mail to Exchange Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

the following versions of cc:Mail:

  cc:Mail DB6 - Export.exe version 5.15
