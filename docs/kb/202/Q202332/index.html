SUMMARY
=======

In Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Software Distribution assignments can be
configured so they do not run when a client has a slow connection, and yet they
are still mandatory over regular Local Area Network (LAN) connections. This
article documents how this feature works.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SMS 2.0 provides a way for clients using a slow connection to skip the running
of advertisements that would usually run. This is accomplished by way of the
"Assignments are not mandatory over slow links" advertisement check box.

If the "Assignments are not mandatory over slow links" box is checked for an
advertisement, the SMS Advertised Program Manager (SMSAPM32) client agent tests
to see if the client is currently connected over a slow link, and if so, then it
does not schedule a program to run based on any of the assignments listed in the
advertisement. The check box only affects scheduling based on the assignments in
the advertisement with the box checked. If there are other advertisements for
the same program and the box is not checked in those other advertisements, the
program will still be scheduled based on assignments in those other
advertisements. The following example is a sample scenario of this:

  

  Sample Scenario:

  Advert 1 for Program A has an assignment to run at 2:00 P.M. but is not
  mandatory over slow links. If the client is connected over a slow link when
  the Offer Data Providers (ODP) run to learn of this advertisement, SMSAPM32
  will not schedule this program.

  If, in addition to Advert 1, you create Advert 2, also for Program A, that has
  an assignment to run at 5:00 P.M., and is mandatory over slow links, when the
  client learns of both Advert 1 and Advert 2, and the client is connected over
  a slow link, Program A will be scheduled to run at 5:00 P.M.

  Assuming Advert 1 and Advert 2 above, if the client connects over a fast link
  at 3:00 P.M. and the ODPs run to learn (or relearn) about the advertisements,
  Program A will be scheduled to run immediately because Advert 1 makes Program
  A mandatory over a fast link at 2:00 P.M. This is true regardless of whether
  or not the client previously learned of these advertisements.

  In the reverse case, where Advert 1 contains a 2:00 P.M. assignment that is
  mandatory over slow links, and Advert 2 contains a 5:00 P.M. assignment that
  is not mandatory over slow links, SMSAPM32 will effectively ignore the
  assignments in Advert 2 and schedule Program A to run at 2:00 P.M. without
  testing to see if the connection is over a slow link.


To trigger SMSAPM32 to re-evaluate whether programs should be scheduled based on
the speed of the network connection, use the refresh option in the Advertised
Programs Monitor on the client. But you should note that SMSAPM32 caches the
determination of whether or not the network is fast or slow for one minute. In
other words, any requests to test the network speed within one minute of the
last time it was actually tested will result in the same determination. This is
to avoid extra network traffic when the ODPs find numerous programs that need to
be scheduled.
