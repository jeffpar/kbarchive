SUMMARY
=======

Hewlett-Packard (HP) provides a scalable printer driver for use with the DeskJet
500 and DeskJet 500C printers and Microsoft Windows version 3.0. This driver is
not updated during the upgrade from Microsoft Windows operating system version
3.0 to version 3.1.

This HP printer driver is not compatible with the TrueType font technology that
is included with Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1. However, the HP
driver does include the scalable fonts CG Times, Courier, and Univers. These
fonts are not available if the Microsoft supplied driver that is included with
Microsoft Windows version 3.1 is used.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When upgrading from the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.0 to
version 3.1, the HP DeskJet 500 scalable font printer driver is not updated. The
earlier driver is left installed because the Microsoft provided DeskJet 500
printer driver does not directly support some of the HP scalable soft fonts
included with the earlier printer driver.

The DeskJet printer driver included with Windows 3.1 supports TrueType fonts,
unlike the HP version. The new driver supplied with Microsoft Windows 3.1 has
compatible fonts to the HP scalable fonts.

TrueType fonts will not be available to Windows applications if the HP supplied
scalable driver is used.

The Microsoft supplied driver includes the following TrueType fonts that are
compatible with the HP scalable fonts.

Hewlett-Packard Scalable Font   Microsoft TrueType Scalable Font
-----------------------------   --------------------------------

CG Times                        Times New Roman
Courier                         Courier New
Univers                         Arial

Do the following to add the new Microsoft Windows 3.1 DeskJet 500 printer
driver:

1. Run Control Panel.

2. Choose the Printers icon.

3. Choose Add.

4. Choose the appropriate driver (DeskJet 500, or DeskJet 500C).

5. Choose Install.

After installing the new DeskJet 500 printer driver, the HP Scalable driver may
be left installed in conjunction with the current driver, or may be removed.

Most Windows-based applications allow switching between printer drivers from the
File menu. Often this selection is available as Print Setup or Printer Setup.
This feature allows you to switch between the earlier HP scalable driver and the
later Microsoft driver that supports TrueType. This feature will only be
available if both drivers are installed.

While the HP scalable driver may be left in tact for compatibility reasons, the
newer TrueType driver provides compatible fonts and should be suited for most
applications. For most users, the HP scalable driver can be removed.

Notes
-----

Saved documents that include CG Times, Courier, and Univers fonts will be
automatically updated to use the TrueType counterparts when the Microsoft 3.1
driver is installed.
