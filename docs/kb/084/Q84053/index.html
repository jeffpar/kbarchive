SUMMARY
=======

In the enhanced mode of the Microsoft Windows graphical environment, each
virtual machine (MS-DOS applications and the Windows system) is scheduled for
execution using a preemptive multitasking algorithm. A terminate-and-
stay-resident program (TSR) that is visible to all processes running in Windows
at any given time (a so-called "global" TSR) must take precautions to prevent
two or more processes from accessing its data concurrently. This article
discusses techniques that a TSR can use to serialize other applications' access
to its data.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A TSR can employ any of the following four techniques to prevent conflicts when
more than one process accesses data simultaneously:

1. Use the virtual memory manager (VMM) to instance the data in the TSR. This
  method requires either a virtual device (VxD) or processing the Windows
  startup broadcast (Interrupt 2Fh Function 1605h) documented in the "Microsoft
  Windows Device Development Kit Virtual Device Adaptation Guide." This
  technique creates a copy of the critical data for each virtual machine that
  requires access. Because each instance has its own private copy, concurrent
  access to the data is impossible. A TSR cannot use instanced data to share
  information between virtual machines or to describe a system-wide state for
  the machine.

2. Encapsulate the global data in a VxD, which performs all data management.
  This article does not discuss this technique.

3. Use the critical section services described in the "Microsoft Windows DDK
  Virtual Device Adaptation Guide."

4. Use semaphores.

An application can implement the third technique by surrounding each access to
the data with calls to the Begin_Critical_Section (Interrupt 2Fh, Function
1681h) and End_Critical_Section (Interrupt 2Fh, Function 1682h) services.
However, doing so can cause a significant performance hit for three reasons:

1. Interrupt 2Fh may be trapped by many TSRs or VxDs; traversing the interrupt
  chain can take a long time.

2. The critical section is claimed by Windows frequently; each call to
  Begin_Critical_Section may block the process or Windows unnecessarily.

3. If the virtual timer device (VTD) reflects a timer interrupt into a virtual
  machine while another VM has claimed the critical section, processing blocks.

Note: The presence of an owned critical section does not suppress task switches
into VMs that receive reflections of hardware interrupts.

If the critical section is not required by the TSR for other reasons, the TSR can
perform serialization much more efficiently by using a semaphore. A semaphore is
a global variable in the TSR than can be maintained using the following code:

      Wait_On_Sem:
          mov     al,1
          xchg    al,[Semaphor]   ;; xchg is indivisible!!!
          test    al,0ffh
          je      Got_Access      ;; If Semaphor was 0, gained access;
          mov     ax,1680h        ;; otherwise,
          int     2fh             ;; release time slice
          jmp short Wait_On_sem   ;; and try again.

     Got_Access:

          &lt; access the data here &gt;

          xor     al,al           ;; Free semaphore.
          xchg    al,[Semaphor]

This code uses the variable Semaphor as a binary semaphore that has either the
value 1, indicating claimed, or 0, indicating free. Note that this technique
depends on the indivisibility of the XCHG instruction. If the processor receives
an interrupt while it is processing an indivisible instruction, the processor
completes the instruction before processing the interrupt. In this example, the
XCHG instruction transfers data between the AL register and the Semaphor
variable. If XCHG was not indivisible and an interrupt occurred as the XCHG was
being processed, two processes could receive the semaphore simultaneously, which
defeats the mutual exclusion that the semaphore is designed to provide. Careful
coding is required when using the semaphore because there is always a
possibility of deadlocking a process.
