SYMPTOMS
========

When you print to an unsupported UNIX-based network, such as PC-NFS, through
Microsoft Windows version 3.1, the print job may fail.

CAUSE
=====

Printing problems in a network installation have a variety of causes. Follow the
troubleshooting steps in this article to locate the problem and correct it.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are a variety of utilities that connect MS-DOS machines to UNIX machines,
where the UNIX system is a file and printer server. Usually, the MS-DOS client
runs a TCP/IP terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program that redirects all
printing to a parallel port to the UNIX machine. There are several things to
consider if you have trouble printing from Windows.

1. Start the network redirector from MS-DOS before you start Windows.

2. If Windows was installed or upgraded with the network running, then Windows
  sees it and Print Manager selects the Update Network Display and Print Net
  Jobs Direct check boxes. These two check boxes should NOT be selected. Run
  Print Manager and choose Network Settings from the Options menu, then clear
  the appropriate check boxes.

3. You should run the Control Panel, choose Printers, and select the port
  LPT1.DOS (or LPT1.OS2 if this Windows installation was upgraded from Windows
  3.0 to 3.1):

  a. Run Control Panel and choose Printers.

  b. Choose the Connect button and choose Port LPT1.DOS.

  c. Choose OK and then choose the Close button.

  NOTE: Clearing the Fast Printing Direct To Port check box doesn't allow the
  system to print, you must choose LPT.x for the port.


4. If you are printing to a PostScript printer, add the following line to the
  WIN.INI file's [modelname,port] section:

  CTRLD=0

  An example of the [modelname,port] section would be:

  [Apple LaserWriter II NTX,LPT3]

  This strips the CTRL+D used for resetting the printer from the print job
  because UNIX-based networks consider the CTRL+D to be an end of file
  character.

NOTE: At the MS-DOS level or in an MS-DOS application run from Windows, you may
not see the print job until the application is exited. For example, run
WordPerfect and send a print job. Nothing happens until WordPerfect is exited or
the WordPerfect Shell command is used to go out to MS-DOS. This is because the
redirector does not know when the print job has actually ended. Turning off the
Print Net Jobs Direct box in Print Manager and switching back to LPT1 corrects
the problem.
