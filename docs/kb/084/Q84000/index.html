The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The DECLARE_VIRTUAL_DEVICE line of every virtual device (VxD) used in the
Microsoft Windows graphical environment contains a VxD identifier (ID) field.
This field contains either the unique number assigned to that virtual device or
the constant Undefined_Device_ID.

While most virtual devices can use the Undefined_Device_ID, certain virtual
devices must a have unique identifier. A VxD that calls an MS-DOS device or a
terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program must have an ID. An ID is also
required for a VxD that provides any of the following:

- A service or services

- A V86-mode application programming interface (API)

- A protected-mode API

Windows does not prevent a VxD that uses the Undefined_Device_ID from loading
more than once in a given Windows session. As Windows loads, it retrieves a list
of all virtual devices to load by sending the Interrupt 2Fh Function 1605h
broadcast and checking the SYSTEM.INI file. If a VxD is specified more than once
and it uses the Undefined_Device_ID, it is loaded multiple times. However, if
the VxD has its own unique ID, Windows recognizes the situation, informs the
user, and aborts the loading process (unless the VxD contains code to address
this situation and allow Windows to continue).

Microsoft uses the V*D.386 naming convention for the VxDs provided with Windows
where the "*" names the device virtualized by the VxD. Other VxD vendors should
use a different naming convention; preferably one that incorporates the company
name. The resulting name should be as mnemonic as possible.

To obtain a unique VxD ID, complete the form below and return it to Microsoft
through electronic mail. Send completed forms to:

  vxdid@microsoft.com

This address is valid for any electronic mail service with Internet access.

Some systems require an address prefix to connect to Internet. For example,
electronic mail on the CompuServe system should be addressed as follows:

  &gt;INTERNET:vxdid@microsoft.com

You may also use a Service Request (SR) to obtain a VxD ID, but be aware that
your service contract will be decremented for an instance, even if you are only
using the SR to obtain a unique VxD ID.

NOTE: Microsoft no longer accepts FAXED or Postal-Mailed ID requests.

NOTE: The method of using OEM numbers documented on page 17-5 of the "Microsoft
Windows Device Development Kit Virtual Device Adaptation Guide" manual for
version 3.0 of the Microsoft Windows Device Development Kit (DDK) is no longer
correct. VxD ID numbers are assigned on a per-VxD basis. Microsoft will assign a
unique number for each VxD you write; OEM ID numbers, which can be used for up
to 32 VxDs, are not assigned.
