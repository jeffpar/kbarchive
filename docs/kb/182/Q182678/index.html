-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, version 1.0, used with:
   - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You can use the Component Builder (CB) to export COBOL statements from a
component library. However, under certain circumstances, the exported COBOL
statements will not be correct.

The situation involves method parameters that are recordsets, and the recordset
parameter is declared as an array and also as having trailing FILLER.

Under these conditions, when the component library is saved and COBOL is
exported, the trailing FILLER item in the exported COBOL statements is generated
as part of each element of the array of recordsets. This is incorrect; there
should be one occurrence of the trailing FILLER following the array as a whole.
For an example of this situation, see the sample COBOL code in the MORE
INFORMATION section of this article.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use a text editor to manually correct the exported
COBOL.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft COM Transaction
Integrator for CICS and IMS version 1.0. This problem was corrected in the
latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining
this Service Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
(without the spaces):

  " S E R V P A C K " (without the quotation marks)

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, the COBOL below was generated from a simple typelib. All contents
of the typelib were declared manually within CB, without using the Import COBOL
Wizard. In this code, a recordset with two elements, COLUMN1 and COLUMN2, is
declared. A method is declared that has one parameter, PARAMETER1. PARAMETER1 is
declared as an array of 12 elements with 25 bytes of trailing FILLER.

In this COBOL code that was generated from the typelib, the trailing FILLER was
generated as part of the array instead of following the entire array:

     01  DFHCOMMAREA.
         05  FILLER OCCURS 12 TIMES.
             10  PARAMETER1 OCCURS 1 TIMES.
                 15  COLUMN1                  PIC S9(4) COMP.
                 15  COLUMN2                  PIC S9(4) COMP.
             10  FILLER                       PIC X(25).

In this example, the preceding COBOL code should be modified so that the FILLER
is not part of the array, as shown in the following code:

     01  DFHCOMMAREA.
         05  FILLER OCCURS 12 TIMES.
             10  PARAMETER1 OCCURS 1 TIMES.
                 15  COLUMN1                  PIC S9(4) COMP.
                 15  COLUMN2                  PIC S9(4) COMP.
         05  FILLER                           PIC X(25).
