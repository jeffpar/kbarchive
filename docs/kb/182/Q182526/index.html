-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

Remote Windows 95 clients who dial into the network to gain access to SNA Server
(that is, via an IBM 8235) may get an error message saying

  SnaBase not started

when using the SNA 3270 or 5250 Applet, as well as third-party emulators. The
error only occurs if the user does not log on to the Windows NT domain, when
prompted for credentials, before the DMOD times out (default timeout is 60
seconds).

CAUSE
=====

When the 3270 or 5250 application is invoked on the client, SnaBase waits for
the connection to SNA Server to activate. The DMOD (Snakrnl.dll) has a timeout
value of 60 seconds by default. If SnaBase does not obtain a connection with SNA
Server within 60 seconds, the DMOD times out, and the user receives an error
message saying SnaBase was not started. The timeout was implemented to keep the
application from waiting indefinitely for the connection between SnaBase and SNA
Server to activate.


WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

To work around this problem, the following registry key can be modified (only on
Windows 95 clients) to increase the time the DMOD waits for SnaBase to start:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SNABase\Parameters
Value=StartTimeOut REG_DWORD: (time in seconds)

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.
