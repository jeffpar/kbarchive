SUMMARY
=======

Through the use of policies, much of the desktop can be restricted. However,
currently there is no way to disable the Start\Help setting through a system
policy. This article will describe some methods to disable the Start\Help
utility.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The file opened by Winhlp32.exe when Start\Help is clicked is
%SystemRoot%\System32\Windows.hlp. If you rename this file, a dialog box is
displayed when the file cannot be found, a different dialog box will be
displayed if you copy an invalid file to that location.

Method 1
--------

A better resolution is to include a trivial help file. Such a help file is
included in the Zero Administration Kit files. It is called Zak.hlp. If this
file is renamed to Windows.hlp in the System32 directory, the following text
will be displayed when Start\Help is clicked:

  Help Topics: Zero Administration Kit Help

The only topic on which you can get help is "ZAK Help." Double-clicking this
topic results in the following message:

  Zero Administration Kit Message

  The standard Windows NT 4.0 online Help has been disabled by your
  administrator.

Method 2
--------

If the drive the help file is stored on is NTFS, you may also restrict access to
the file using permissions.

1. Select the file (Windows.hlp) in Explorer.

2. Edit the properties of the file.

3. Select the security tab.

4. Select the permissions button.

5. Set permissions to restrict the users who should not be able to run the help
  file.

Restricting the help file with permissions may cause user complaints, though.
When the restricted file is clicked, nothing happens.
