-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, version 1.0, used with:
   - Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After starting the Import COBOL Wizard, it may become impossible to view or
select the Windows taskbar. This problem occurs after browsing to select the
import file. When this problem occurs, the taskbar will not be available until
the Import COBOL Wizard has finished running. This problem occurs if both of the
following conditions are true:

- The taskbar has been set to "Auto hide" mode.

-and-

- While the taskbar is hidden, the window for Component Builder, which is being
  used to create a component library, has been resized to cover the entire
  monitor screen area, although not actually maximized.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, resize the CB window so that at least a very small
portion of the background window is visible. After doing this, the problem will
not occur while using the Import COBOL Wizard.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft COM Transaction
Integrator for CICS and IMS version 1.0.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
