The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Zero Administration Kit for Windows NT Workstation 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Windows NT using the Zero Administration Kit (ZAK) with a
desktop setup that does not permit users to launch Windows NT Explorer, you can
still gain access to Windows NT Explorer when in a Microsoft Office application.
This is achieved by inserting an object into the document and typing in the path
and file name from the import box.

CAUSE
=====

The Explorer.exe file has Read &amp; Execute (RX) special permissions, which
enable the folder to be opened from within the application. The file is first
read before it can be run. These permissions are set during the ZAK install when
Acls.cmd is run.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, remove the Read (R) special permission from the Everyone
Group. If the file cannot be read, it cannot be run. However, you must retain
the Execute (X) special permission so that Explorer remains as the active
desktop. Use one of the following methods.

Method One
----------

1. Start Explorer and locate Explorer.exe in the %SystemRoot% folder.

2. Right-click the executable file and select Properties.

3. Select the Security tab from the Properties window and click the Permissions
  button.

4. Double-click the Everyone Group and view the Special Access dialog box.

5. Remove (clear) the Read(R) attribute and confirm the changes.

Method Two
----------

Edit Acls.cmd and change the following line from:

     cacls.exe explorer.exe /t /e /g everyone:r

to:

     xcacls.exe explorer.exe /t /e /p everyone:x

where:

  xcacls is used because special permissions are being set
  /p is used to replace existing permission
  x is used to grant execute permission

NOTE: xcacls is a resource kit utility and should be accessible through the path
or referenced explicitly.

  TITLE : Unauthorized Program Can Be Installed and Run on ZAK Workstation
