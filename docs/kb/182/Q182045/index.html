SYMPTOMS
========

After you start a build in Microsoft Developer Studio, there could be an
excessive delay before the actual build begins. This typically happens when
building a large project. The delay can be about 3-5 minutes and an hourglass is
shown in the Developer Studio. Then the build proceeds normally. This happens
even when the project is up-to-date.

This delay occurs only when you try to build the first time after opening the
workspace. Subsequent builds do not experience the delay.

This delay happens only in Developer Studio running under Windows 95.

CAUSE
=====

This delay is caused by the dependency checking preceding the build. Before the
build can start, Developer Studio needs to check file dependencies to decide
which files are to be built. For a large project with complex dependencies,
Developer Studio can spend a long time checking file timestamp information on a
Windows 95 machine.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following are two related workarounds. You should try Workaround 1 first; if
that does not work, then consider the second workaround combined with the first
workaround:

Workaround 1. Use compiler switches /Yc and /Yu to create and use a precompiled
header.

Workaround 2. Use a precompiled header aggressively by including most of your
project's header files in the precompiled header.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++ .NET.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This delay can also be experienced when you try to export the makefile or start
a debug session the first time after opening the workspace.
