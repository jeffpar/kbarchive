SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows NT Event Viewer may display the following:

  Event ID: 1025
  Source: MSExchangeIS Private | Public
  Type: Warning
  Category:
  Description: An error occurred.
  Function name of description of problem: ecGetRestriction

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because search folders are created and added multiple times
to the backlinks list of the folder(s) being searched. When the search folder is
deleted, the additional entries of this search folder are not removed from the
backlinks list.

When items change in this folder, the folder tries to notify the members of the
backlinks list so the search folders can be updated.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this
fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.


Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.5. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are two types of folders--search folders and normal folders. Search
folders are the folders created by clients when they perform a search of a
folder and its subfolders. The search folder contains information such as the
folders being searched, the messages that meet the conditions, and so on.

Normal folders have a property called ptagSearchBackLinks that contains the name
of all search folders that are referencing this normal folder. When items change
in the folder (messages are added, modified, or deleted), the folder must notify
the search folder through the ptagSearchBAckLinks lists.

The problem is that when these search folders are created (the client does a
Tools/Find), the search folder is added to the ptagSearchBAckLinks more than
once. However, when the search folders are deleted (the client closes the
Tools/Find dialog), the folders are not removed from the ptagSearBackLinks the
same number of times that they were added. Now when the items in the normal
folders change, they attempt to notify a search folder that does not exist, and
the 1025 Event ID is generated.

If an event with the EcGetRestriction description is logged in the Event Viewer
with the latest service packs installed , an ISInteg with the -fix option would
need to be performed to correct the issue.

In Exchange Server version 5.0, the syntax from the exchsrvr\bin folder on the
command line is "ISInteg -pri -fix" (without the quotation marks) or "-pub"
(without the quotation marks).

In Exchange Server version 5.5, the syntax from the exchsrvr\bin folder on the
command line is "ISInteg -pri -fix -test alltests" (without the quotation
marks).
