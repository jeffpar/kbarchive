-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This article describes six issues related to the Host Security Integration
feature included of SNA Server.


Issue 1
-------

The following services use an excessive amount of non-paged pool memory:

- Host Account Cache service (Snaudb.exe)

- SNA Host Account Synchronization service (Hostproc.exe)

- SNA WinNT Account Synchronization service (Snapmp.exe)


Issue 2
-------

The SNA WinNT Account Synchronization service generates two access violations for
each password change request that it processes. The exception handler catches
and ignores each of these access violations. There are no noticeable signs that
these access violations occur and they do not result in any problems with the
password change request. The access violations are only noticeable when you use
a debugger to step through the application code.


Issue 3
-------

The SNA WinNT Account Synchronization service leaks one handle and approximately
12 KB of memory each time a user account is added to the host account database
with the SNACFG command-line configuration utility.


Issue 4
-------

Event ID 3000 is incorrectly logged in the Windows NT Application Event Log by
the AS/400 security provider when you are using the SNA Server Host Security
features for AS/400 connections. Event 3000 should indicate the AS/400 security
provider DLL (sec400.dll) has been loaded.

The following is an example of the incorrect event that is logged:

  Event ID: 3000
  Source: AS400 MDSI
  Description: Has been loaded by:


Issue 5
-------

The Host Account Database service may corrupt its account database when an
existing user record is modified or deleted and the user's host account name
hash is not unique (that is, there is another user whose host account name hash
has the same value). The database can also get corrupted when a new user is
added to the database using a dummy host account and then modified with the
correct host account info.

This problem can manifest itself in a number of ways. The following are some of
the symptoms that can occur if the database becomes corrupted:

- Host Account Database service hangs or it stops responding to RPC requests.

- Single Signon requests fail randomly.

- SNACFG Host Security operations fail randomly.

- The Host Account Database service logs Events 1283 through 1305 in the
  Application Event Log when the database is corrupt. The exact event number
  depends on how the database is corrupted.


Issue 6
-------

Single Sign-on does not work if the Host Account Cache service is not running
when the SNA Server service starts. If the SNA Server service cannot contact the
host security database when it is started, all single sign-on requests will hang
and no errors will be reported to the application. The only recovery is to
restart the SNA Server service. Starting the Host Account Cache service after
the SNA Server service is started will not correct the problem.


Issue 7
-------

The Host Account Cache service (snaudb.exe) may enter a loop that causes it to
utilize all available CPU cycles and memory on the computer it is running on.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and
4.0.
This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server versions 3.0 and 4.0 U.S.
