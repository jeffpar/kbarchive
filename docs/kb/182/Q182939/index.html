-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Access 97 
- Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install a Microsoft Access 97 run-time application that was created on
a computer running Microsoft Office 97 Service Release 1 (SR-1), the name, the
organization, and the product ID (PID) of the registered user on the target
computer are replaced with those of the creator of the run- time application.
This information appears in the About Microsoft Access dialog box.

CAUSE
=====

The computer on which you have installed the run-time application is running the
retail version of Microsoft Access 97 or Microsoft Office 97 Professional that
has not been updated with SR-1. Consequently, the installation of a run-time
application that was created on a computer running Microsoft Office Service
Release 1 (SR-1) overwrites the Msaccess.exe file on the target computer.

The default behavior of the Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Setup Wizard is
to overwrite older files during the installation of a run-time application. The
version of Msaccess.exe installed by SR-1 is newer and therefore overwrites the
version of Msaccess.exe and the user information that already exists on the
target computer.

NOTE: Except for the issue described in the "Symptoms" section, both the run-time
applications and the full retail version of Microsoft Access 97 behave normally,
regardless of which version of Msaccess.exe is installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are three methods that you can use to prevent this behavior or to return a
computer to its original state after overwriting Msaccess.exe. Microsoft
recommends that you use Method 1 or Method 2 to resolve this issue.

Method 1
--------

If Msaccess.exe has already been overwritten and incorrect user information
appears in the About Microsoft Access dialog box, follow these steps on the
target computer:

1. Uninstall the run-time application.

2. Completely remove Microsoft Office 97. For more information, please see the
  following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q158658 OFF97: How to Completely Remove Microsoft Office 97

3. Reinstall Microsoft Office 97. Then, download and install the Microsoft
  Office 97 Service Release 1 patch. For more information about Microsoft
  Office 97 Service Release 1, please see the following article in the
  Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q150613 Microsoft Office 97 Service Release 1 Patch

  You can also find information about the Microsoft Office 97 Service Release 1
  Patch at the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://office.microsoft.com/assistance/9798/sr1fact.aspx

4. Reinstall the run-time application.

Method 2
--------

If the run-time application has not yet been installed on the target computer,
download and install the SR-1 patch before you install the run- time
application.

Method 3
--------

To change the default behavior of the Setup program so that the newer version of
Msaccess.exe does not overwrite the older version, you can modify the Setup.inf
file.

WARNING: Following these steps produces a configuration that has not been tested;
this method is not supported by Microsoft product support professionals and may
result in unexpected behavior. Any use of this method IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.

WARNING: This method prevents Setup from overwriting Msaccess.exe with a newer
version of the file. If your application uses features such as snapshots that
were not available before to the release of SR-1, your application may not
function correctly on a computer that has not already been upgraded with the
SR-1 patch. Microsoft recommends that you use Method 1 or Method 2 to resolve
this issue.

1. Make a backup of the Setup.inf file. The file is located on Disk 1 of your
  distribution disks or in the Net folder of the network install share point.

2. NOTE: In the following sample Setup.inf file, an underscore (_) at the end of
  a line is used as a line-continuation character for ease of reading. The
  underscore character does not actually appear in the Setup.inf file, nor
  should you insert it.

  Open Setup.inf in a text editor such as Notepad. Locate the following line in
  the [Access Runtime Files] section:

  "msaccess_exe" = 1,MSACCESS.EXE&lt;MSACCESS.EXE&gt;,,,,,,0,OLDER,,,,,, _
  SHARED,3016976,,,,8.0.0.4122,

  Change the line so that it reads as follows:

  "msaccess_exe" = 1,MSACCESS.EXE&lt;MSACCESS.EXE&gt;,,,,,,0,NEVER,,,,,, _
  SHARED,3016976,,,,8.0.0.4122,

3. Locate the following line in the [Shared Office Files] section:

  "msaccess_exe" = 1,MSACCESS.EXE&lt;MSACCESS.EXE&gt;,,,,,,0,OLDER,,,,,, _
  SHARED,3016976,,,,8.0.0.4122,

  Change the line so that it reads as follows:

  "msaccess_exe" = 1,MSACCESS.EXE&lt;MSACCESS.EXE&gt;,,,,,,0,NEVER,,,,,, _
  SHARED,3016976,,,,8.0.0.4122,

4. Locate the following line in the [Shared Internet Files] section:

  "msaccess_exe" = 1,MSACCESS.EXE&lt;MSACCESS.EXE&gt;,,,,,,0,OLDER,,,,,, _
  SHARED,3016976,,,,8.0.0.4122,

  Change the line so that it reads as follows:

  "msaccess_exe" = 1,MSACCESS.EXE&lt;MSACCESS.EXE&gt;,,,,,,0,NEVER,,,,,, _
  SHARED,3016976,,,,8.0.0.4122,

5. Locate the following line in the [msvcrt40 support file] section:

  "msaccess_exe" = 1,MSACCESS.EXE&lt;MSACCESS.EXE&gt;,,,,,,0,OLDER,,,,,, _
  SHARED,3016976,,,,8.0.0.4122,

  Change the line so that it reads as follows:

  "msaccess_exe" = 1,MSACCESS.EXE&lt;MSACCESS.EXE&gt;,,,,,,0,NEVER,,,,,, _
  SHARED,3016976,,,,8.0.0.4122,

6. Locate the following line in the [ctl3d32 support file] section:

  "msaccess_exe" = 1,MSACCESS.EXE&lt;MSACCESS.EXE&gt;,,,,,,0,OLDER,,,,,, _
  SHARED,3016976,,,,8.0.0.4122,

  Change the line so that it reads as follows:

  "msaccess_exe" = 1,MSACCESS.EXE&lt;MSACCESS.EXE&gt;,,,,,,0,NEVER,,,,,, _
  SHARED,3016976,,,,8.0.0.4122,

7. Save the changes to Setup.inf.
