-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After applying Service Pack 3 (SP3) for Systems Management Server 1.2, all
Microsoft Windows for Workgroup and Microsoft Windows 95 clients report a floppy
disk drive B in the inventory even if computers have only one floppy disk drive
(drive A).

This drive is added in the "Disks" icon property without information about the
size of the floppy disk drive (3.5" 1.44 MB for example) in the Storage Type
list.

This problem did not occur prior to Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 3.

WORKAROUND
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. To resolve this problem immediately, contact
Microsoft Technical Support to obtain the fix. If you are not severely impacted
by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next
Systems Management Server service pack that contains this fix.

For a complete list of Microsoft Technical Support phone numbers and information
on support costs, please go to the following address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

This fix should have the following file attributes:

  Date     Time    Size    File Name    Platform
  ----------------------------------------------
  5/15/98  2:10am  18KB    GETDISK.EXE  Intel


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 1.2. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

  S E R V P A C K

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, perform the following steps on the SMS Site Server:

1. In the &lt;SMS_root_directory&gt;\Site.srv\maincfg.box\client.src\x86.bin
  directory on the site server, replace the Getdisk.exe file with the version
  obtained from the hotfix.

2. That file will replicated at the next Maintenance Manager work cycle to all
  SMS Logon Servers to the following directory:

  SMS\Logon.srv\X86.bin

  When that occurs the clients may be updated.

To update the clients, either manually run Upgrade.bat on each client or follow
the instructions in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q166771 SMS: How to Force Site-Wide Client Updates
