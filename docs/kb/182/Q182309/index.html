SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use the Microsoft Mail Post Office Serialization
utility in conjunction with the Microsoft Select CD Program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Serializer utility must be installed from the disk on which it is furnished
to a hard disk. The following Caution is taken from the Select CD
documentation:

CAUTION: You must install the Serializer program on a local hard disk. Do not
install the Serializer program on a network drive or path, on a RAM drive, or on
a virtual drive. Attempting to install the Serializer program on a network drive
or path will result in incorrect Serializer operation and loss of serial number
range.

To install the Serial.exe program on a hard disk:

1. Place the disk in drive A.

2. At the MS-DOS prompt for the disk drive, type SERIAL and press ENTER.

3. Select Install/Uninstall Serializer to Another Location by pressing the UP or
  DOWN arrow keys, and then press ENTER. A Serializer message appears, warning
  that the copy of Serial.exe in the current location will be deleted and
  prompting you as to whether you want to continue.

4. Type "Y" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER.

5. Type the complete path to the new location, including the drive letter. This
  location must already exist. The Serial.exe program will not create
  subdirectories. The program copies itself to the specified location and
  deletes the old copy.

6. To exit Serial.exe, press ENTER or ESC on the main menu.

To uninstall the Serial.exe program from the hard disk, use the same procedure,
substituting the hard drive location in step 1 above and entering A:\ for the
new path location (step 5).

To serialize an MS Mail (PC) disk created using the Select CD program, do the
following:

1. Create disk #1 from the Select CD user interface.

2. Exit Windows completely and start the computer in the MS-DOS mode.

3. Change the hard disk drive location to the place where the Serial.exe program
  was stored.

4. Type "Serial" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt and press
  ENTER.

5. Select Serialize Setup Diskette using the UP and DOWN arrow keys and press
  ENTER.

6. Type the letter of the drive that contains the Server 1 Setup disk to be
  serialized and press ENTER. The Serializer program asks whether you want to
  reserialize the disk. An unserialized copy of the Server 1 disk contains a
  serial number placeholder that the Serializer program replaces with a usable
  serial number.

7. Type "Y" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER. The disk is
  serialized and a message displays to the serial number that is used.

8. Note the serial number in a permanent location, such as on the disk label.
  You need to provide the serial number to postoffice administrators. They can
  configure other postoffices to communicate with the postoffice you install
  from the disk.

9. Press ENTER.

10. To exit Serial.exe, press ESC on the main menu.
