-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses scoring in the SkiFree game that ships with Microsoft
Entertainment Pack volume 3. There is no online documentation included with this
game that describes scoring.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are three different courses that can be played in SkiFree. They are
Slalom, Freestyle, and Tree Slalom. To begin a course, position the skier
between the starting flags for the course you want. You can do this with the
arrow keys on the keyboard or with the mouse.

Freestyle Scoring
-----------------

The starting flags for the freestyle course are located at the 37 meter mark of
the slope. You can earn points between the 37 meter mark and the 1040 meter mark
where the course ends. Points are accumulated (or lost) in the freestyle course
as follows:

- Scaring a dog earns 3 points.

- Jumping over anything earns 6 points.

- Making a novice crash earns 20 points.

- Making a snowboarder crash earns 20 points.

- Jumping over a magic mushroom earns 100 points.

- Jumping over a burning tree earns 1000 points.

- Crashing into an obstacle loses 32 points.

- Going over yellow snow loses 16 points.

- A crash landing loses 64 points.

- Doing a backscratcher earns a number of points equal to eight times the
  amount of time you're in the air.

- Doing a head-over-heels flip earns a number of points equal to four times the
  amount of time you're in the air.

- Doing a helicopter earns a number of points equal to two times the amount of
  time you're in the air.

- Just being in the air earns a number of points equal to the amount of time
  you're in the air.

Slalom and Tree Slalom Scoring
------------------------------

The starting flags for the slalom and tree slalom courses are located at the 37
meter mark of the slope. You can earn points between the 37 meter mark and the
1040 meter mark of the tree slalom course, and between the 37 meter mark and the
540 meter mark for the slalom course. Points are accumulated (or lost) in both
of the slalom courses as follows:

- Your base score is the time it takes you to complete the course.

- Five seconds is added to your time for each slalom that you miss.
