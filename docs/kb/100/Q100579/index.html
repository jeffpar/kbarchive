SYMPTOMS
========

A deadlock situation in which the system is apparently frozen but the mouse
still moves on the screen.

CAUSE
=====

Claiming a critical section from inside a timer (IRQ 0) interrupt handler may
cause a deadlock in the following scenario:

1. Virtual machine (VM) A claims the critical section.

2. VM B receives a virtual timer interrupt, tries to claim the critical section
  itself, and gets suspended.

3. VM A waits on a timer tick before it releases the critical section, but will
  no longer see timer interrupts. This deadlocks the machine.

Note that it is not uncommon for global terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR)
programs to wait for timer interrupts to occur before resuming execution; in
particular, many network drivers use this technique to periodically retry
unsuccessful packet transmissions.

WORKAROUND
==========

The workaround for this problem is to use the documented TimerCriticalSection
entry in SYSTEM.INI, which will implicitly wrap the virtual interrupt into a
critical section.

Alternatively, application code could call into a VxD to obtain the critical
section status (using the Get_Crit_Sect_Status service) before attempting to
claim the critical section in a timer tick.

MORE INFORMATION
================

VM A no longer receives timer interrupts in the above scenario because the
virtual timer device (VTD) sets the V86 interrupt vector of each virtual machine
to a small code stub that filters out certain timer interrupts. In particular,
the code stub does not allow nested timer interrupts to be reflected into the
same virtual machine. Thus, virtual machine B has a pending timer interrupt, and
therefore, virtual machine A does not receive any timer interrupts but does not
release the critical section because it waits for a timer interrupt, while VM B
does not finish processing the timer interrupt because it is suspended on the
critical section. This scenario will deadlock the two processes.

NeilSa discovered a bug in the VTD that initializes the code stub at the wrong
time, causing a black screen of death under certain circumstances. The 1-byte
fix for that bug involves relocating the VTD_Device_Init code to Init_Complete,
but it will not fix the problem discussed in this article. dskbsweep
