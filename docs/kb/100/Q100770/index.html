SUMMARY
=======

Many applications use a modal dialog box as the main application window.
Applications that use this technique may also include a main menu on the dialog
box. Typically, one or more of the menu items has a keyboard accelerator
associated with it. This article describes the steps that are required to add a
menu and keyboard accelerators to an MFC Application Wizard dialog box-based
application.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A typical application that is developed for the Microsoft Windows operating
system by using Visual C++ and the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit
(SDK) and that uses keyboard accelerators calls the TranslateAccelerator()
function in its main message loop. However, when you use a modal dialog box as
the main window, the application does not have a main message loop; instead, the
application uses the dialog box manager message loop (built into Windows) to
translate and dispatch messages. Of course, because this message loop is not
designed to process accelerators, it does not call the TranslateAccelerator()
function.

To process accelerator keys in a modal dialog box in MFC, you must override the
CWinApp::ProcessMessageFilter() function. The framework calls
ProcessMessageFilter() before it processes a message.

To modify an MFC Application Wizard dialog box-based application type in Visual
C++ .NET to correctly process accelerator keys, follow these steps:

1. In Visual Studio .NET, create a new MFC application. In the left pane of the
  MFC Application Wizard, click Application Type, and then make sure that
  Application type is set to Dialog based.

2. In Resource view, double-click the dialog resource to open the dialog
  resource editor. The resource ID of the dialog resource is similar to
  IDD_&lt;MYPROJECT&gt;_DIALOG (where &lt;MYPROJECT&gt; is the name that you
  gave your application project when you created it).

3. With the dialog resource open in the dialog resource editor, locate the
  Properties window. Edit the dialog box Border property and specify the Thin
  border style. This step is required for a dialog box that contains a menu.

4. Create a new menu resource that contains a top-level entry named &amp;File
  and a menu item named &amp;Exit\tCTRL+E (CTRL+X is usually associated with
  cutting text, so CTRL+E is used instead).

5. In the menu editor, click the newly created Exit menu item. In the Properties
  window, make sure that the ID property for the Exit menu item is set to
  ID_FILE_EXIT.

6. Associate the new menu with the dialog box by entering the menu ID in the
  dialog resource Menu property. Open the dialog editor for the dialog resource
  and find the Menu property in the Properties window. Set it to the resource
  ID that you created for the menu in step 4. To do this, click the drop-down
  list in the Menu property row, and then click to select the resource ID for
  the menu in the list.

7. In the menu editor, right-click &amp;Exit\tCTRL+E, and then click Add Event
  Handler.

8. In the Event Handler Wizard, select the COMMAND message type. In the Class
  list, select the CDialog derived main class for the handler to be generated
  in. Make sure that the function handler name is appropriate, and then click
  Add and Edit to create the menu item event handler.

9. Insert the following line in the function Exit menu item event handler method
  that is generated in step 8:

  PostMessage(WM_COMMAND, IDOK, 0L);

This produces the same effect as clicking OK when the user clicks Exit on the
File menu. Clicking OK closes your dialog box application.

10. Create a new accelerator resource and associate the CTRL+E key combination
  with ID_FILE_EXIT. Save your changes.

11. Edit the Stdafx.h file to declare the following global variables after the
  #include statements:

  extern HWND    ghDlg;          // Handle to main dialog box.
  extern HACCEL  ghAccelTable;   // Handle to accelerator table.

12. In the .cpp file that contains the CWinApp derived class implementation
  (usually the .cpp file with the same base name as your project name), add
  the following global variable initializations:

  HWND    ghDlg = 0;          // Handle to main dialog box.
  HACCEL  ghAccelTable = 0;   // Handle to accelerator table.

13. In the main CDialog derived class (not the dialog class that implements the
  default About dialog box), find the OnInitDialog() method. If necessary, you
  can add an override for the OnInitDialog() method. To do this, click to
  select the CDialog derived class in the Class View window, and then click
  Overrides in the Properties window. Find the OnInitDialog row and click the
  right column. If OnInitDialog() is not overridden for this class, you have
  the option to create an override.

14. Edit the function that you added earlier to include the following line of
  code:

  ghDlg = m_hWnd;

15. In the .cpp file that contains the CWinApp derived implementation, find the
  InitInstance() class method. Add the following line immediately after the
  call to the base class CWinApp::InitInstance():

  ghAccelTable = LoadAccelerators(AfxGetInstanceHandle(),
  MAKEINTRESOURCE(IDR_ACCELERATOR1));

NOTE: The resource ID that is used here (IDR_ACCELERATOR1) is the ID of the
accelerator table resource that is added in step 10.

16. Add an override to the CWinApp derived class for the ProcessMessageFilter()
  class method. To do this, in the Class View window, select the CWinApp
  derived class in your project. Then, in the Properties window, click
  Overrides. Find the ProcessMessageFilter row in the Properties window and
  select the right-most column of that row. Click the drop-down arrow, and
  then click the option to add an override for the ProcessMessageFilter
  method.

17. Edit the ProcessMessageFilter() method override so that it has the following
  implementation:

  BOOL CMyProjectApp::ProcessMessageFilter(int code, LPMSG lpMsg)
         {
            if (code &lt; 0)
               CWinApp::ProcessMessageFilter(code, lpMsg);

            if (ghDlg &amp;&amp; ghAccelTable)
               {
               if (::TranslateAccelerator(ghDlg, ghAccelTable, lpMsg))
                  return(TRUE);
               }

           return CWinApp::ProcessMessageFilter(code, lpMsg);
        }

18. Compile and run the application. Note that it has a menu. When you click
  Exit on the File menu or press CTRL+E, the application closes, as expected.
