SUMMARY
=======

This article contains questions and answers about Microsoft Exchange in Windows
95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Q. Where can I find more information about installing and using the Microsoft
  Exchange client in Windows 95?

  A. For more information about installing and using Microsoft Exchange, refer
  to the following resources:

   - See the Exchange.txt file in the Windows folder.

   - Press the F1 key in Microsoft Exchange.

   - See the "Electronic Mail and Microsoft Exchange" topic in the Windows 95
     Resource Kit Help file (Win95rk.hlp). This Help file is in the
     Admin\Reskit\Helpfile folder on the Windows 95 CD-ROM.

2. Q. Can Microsoft Mail 3.x clients run in Windows 95?

  A. Yes. Current Microsoft Mail clients are supported in Windows 95. However,
  the Microsoft Exchange client offers a more feature-rich, unified user
  interface that is capable of connecting to a variety of additional services.

3. Q. Will Microsoft Exchange convert my previous mail file to a Microsoft
  Exchange version?

  A. Yes. Microsoft Exchange asks you whether you want it to copy information
  from your existing mail file (.mmf file) to a Microsoft Exchange personal
  information store (.pst file). This process does not alter your .mmf file.
  Note that Microsoft Exchange cannot convert your .mmf file if it is located
  on the postoffice.

  You can also convert .mmf files later by clicking Import on the File menu. You
  must know the password for the .mmf file to import it.

4. Q. Can I use multiple Microsoft Mail clients at the same time in Windows 95?

  A. Microsoft does not support the use of multiple mail clients concurrently.
  You can run the client for Microsoft Mail 3.x, Microsoft Remote Mail, or
  Microsoft Exchange, but you cannot run them at the same time.

  You cannot run multiple mail clients at once because doing so could cause file
  contention problems, database damage on the postoffice, and other
  complications for remote mail users and mail-aware programs.

5. Q. Can I use Microsoft Schedule+ version 1.0 with the Microsoft Exchange
  client?

  A. You can continue to use Schedule+ 1.0 with the Microsoft Exchange client;
  however, its functionality is somewhat diminished. For example, Schedule+ 1.0
  works in standalone mode, but you cannot send or receive meeting requests.
  For more information, see the "Using Microsoft Exchange with Schedule+ 1.0"
  topic in the Exchange.txt file in the Windows folder.

6. Q. Can I continue to use Microsoft Schedule+ version 1.0 if I use the
  Microsoft Mail 3.x components?

  A. As long as you do not install the Microsoft Exchange components, Schedule+
  1.0 works just as it did in earlier versions of Windows.

7. Q. Can multiple people use the same Windows 95 workstation, use Microsoft
  Exchange, and keep their e-mail messages private, separate, and secure?

  A. Yes. Windows 95 and the Microsoft Exchange client are designed to
  accommodate multiple users. There are several ways to address this need. For
  example, you can protect your message files with passwords and set up
  Microsoft Exchange for multiple profiles on a local computer. However, a
  server-based setup offers a more centralized approach to managing multiple
  users on a single workstation.

  For more information, see the "Deployment Planning Guide" and "Installation"
  sections of the Windows 95 Resource Kit online Help file.

8. Q. Can people who work at multiple workstations store all their e-mail in a
  single, secure message file?

  A. Yes. There are several ways to do this. For example, you can store the
  password-protected .pst and .pab files in an easily accessible location on
  the network. Your Microsoft Exchange profile must specify these files at each
  workstation you use. Another solution is to implement a server-based setup
  that enables the retrieval of a much larger set of desktop and configuration
  preferences from anywhere on the network, and then run this configuration on
  the current workstation.

  For more information, see the "Deployment Planning Guide" and "Installation"
  sections of the Windows 95 Resource Kit online Help file.

9. Q. Can I use shared folders in Microsoft Exchange?

  A. To view shared folders in Microsoft Exchange, download and install the
  Exupdusa.exe file. For information about obtaining this file, please see the
  following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q141127 SFS Post Office Shared Folders Not Available with MS Exchange

10. Q. Can I spell-check my messages in Microsoft Exchange?

  A. The Microsoft Exchange client in Windows 95 does not include a spelling
  checker. However, Microsoft Exchange can use a spelling checker from another
  32-bit program. For example, Microsoft Exchange can use the spelling checker
  included with Microsoft Office 95.
