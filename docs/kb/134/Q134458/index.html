SUMMARY
=======

This article contains a summary of major differences between working with slides
in PowerPoint 4.0 and PowerPoint for Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Working with slides in PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0, is different in
some ways than working with slides in PowerPoint version 4.0 for Windows.

- Slide Sorter's maximum view scale is 100 percent in PowerPoint 7.0. In
  PowerPoint 4.0, it is 400 percent.

- In PowerPoint 7.0, any shape with text can be dragged and dropped onto any
  empty text placeholder, and the placeholder will take on that shape.

- When you apply a template in PowerPoint 7.0, the Notes and Handout Masters
  are not affected. In PowerPoint 4.0, applying a template eliminates all the
  previously existing formatting for the Notes and Handout Masters.

- PowerPoint 7.0 has two Slide Masters; a Title Master, which controls all
  slides that use the Title Slide AutoLayout, and a Slide Master, which
  controls all other AutoLayouts. If the current slide uses the Title Slide
  layout, and you SHIFT+Click the Slides View button, you will go to the Title
  Master view. If you have not yet created a Title Master, you will go to the
  Slide Master instead.

- In PowerPoint 4.0, if you copy a slide while in Outline View and then click
  Paste on the Edit menu while a slide is selected, the selected slide will be
  replaced with the pasted slide. This has been changed in PowerPoint 7.0 so
  that the new slide is pasted after the selected slide. This change is
  intended to help prevent you from accidentally deleting slides you did not
  intend to delete.

- There is no Outline Master in PowerPoint 7.0. Its functionality has been
  added to the Handout Master. If you click the Outline View button while
  holding down the SHIFT key, you will go to the Handout Master.

For more information on how to use any of the new slide-related functionality in
PowerPoint for Windows 95, see either of the following categories in PowerPoint
