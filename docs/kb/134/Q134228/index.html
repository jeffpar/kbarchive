SYMPTOMS
========

During a postoffice Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync), the DIRSYNC.LOG may
indicate one of the following errors:

  06/12/95 16:52:14 | Status Microsoft (R) Mail Import V3.2a
  06/12/95 16:52:23 | Fatal [ 7] Error renaming file: M:INF\IMPORT.INF

  or

  06/08/94 02:47:52 | Status Microsoft (R) Mail Import V3.2.6
  06/08/94 03:13:25 | Fatal [ 7] Error renaming file: M:USR\IMPORT.USR

CAUSE
=====

In general, IMPORT.EXE generates the above error message when it is unable to
rename the temporary IMPORT.* file to the appropriate &lt;hexid&gt;.INF or
&lt;hexid&gt;.USR file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Generally, this inability to properly rename the files is caused by that
particular file (INF or USR) being inaccessible for some reason. These reasons
may include any of the following:

- The INF is locked open.

- The user account logged into the network and running the Dir-Sync processes
  (DISPATCH.EXE) does not have sufficient rights to the postoffice or its
  subdirectories.

- Insufficient file handles in the CONFIG.SYS of the MS-DOS machine running the
  DISPATCH.EXE process.

- One or more INF (or USR) file in the INF subdirectory is marked as read-only.

- Anti virus software operating in "real time" on the server.

- Because of oplocks on the Windows NT server, the reads and writes are cached.
  Removing Opportunistic Locking on the Windows NT server experiencing the
  fatal 7 has been known to resolve this issue. To remove Oplocks from the
  server use REGEDT32.EXE, and change the following key;

  WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
  problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
  Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
  Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer \Parameters

MORE INFORMATION
================

Any single postoffice refers to each of the externally defined postoffices by a
hexadecimal identifier (hex-id). For example, one particular postoffice might
refer to another postoffice by identifying it with the hex- id of 00000005.
Therefore, the MBG and KEY files for all outbound mail to this externally
defined postoffice will be 00000005.MBG and 00000005.KEY. The external user list
will exist in 00000005.USR, and any template information will exist in
00000005.TPL and 00000005.INF (the template format and information files,
respectively). Each of these files will reside in their appropriate
subdirectories.

When IMPORT.EXE processes during the Dir-Sync cycle, it creates temporary files
to store the completed updated files; two examples of these temporary files are
the IMPORT.INF and IMPORT.USR files. Once the process is complete, IMPORT.EXE
attempts to rename the temporary file to the actual file name. In this case,
IMPORT.EXE would try to rename IMPORT.INF to 00000005.INF or IMPORT.USR to
00000005.USR. The previously listed error messages are generated in the
DIRSYNC.LOG if this renaming process can not be completed.

NOTE: The Fatal 7 error is often followed by several Warning 90 messages.


After the Dir-Sync process completes and one of these error messages is
generated, the IMPORT.INF or IMPORT.USR file may exist in the INF or USR
subdirectory. The mail administrator may wish to attempt to complete the
Dir-Sync process manually.

First, ensure that none of the problems listed above exist on this postoffice.
Next, run a manual Import by typing in the following command against the problem
postoffice:

  "IMPORT -D&lt;drive&gt; ADMIN -P&lt;password&gt; -Y -Q" (without the
  quotation marks)

If IMPORT.EXE executes without error, then the problem should be resolved on that
postoffice.
