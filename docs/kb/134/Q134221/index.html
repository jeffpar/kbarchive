-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Explorapedia series: World of Nature for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Explorapedia, World of People, you notice that Little Kids
Mode is now available in Explorapedia, World of Nature, where it did not
previously exist.

CAUSE
=====

World of Nature did not have a Little Kids Mode, which was added to the
functionality of World of People. Because World of Nature and World of People
share files, this functionality is also shared once you install World of
People.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE
------------------

1. Run Explorapedia, World of Nature, version 1.0.

2. Once in the program, Tad asks you what you want to do.

3. Click Something Else, then click Change Settings.

4. In the Settings list, you see Little Kids Mode as one of your choices.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When Little Kids Mode is active, when you click objects and animals in scenes,
you see animations, and then you can click another object or animal to see
another animation. You don't go to the Exploratron when Little Kids Mode is
active.

When Little Kids Mode is not active, when you click on animals or objects in the
scenes in Explorapedia, you see the animation for it, then you go directly to
that topic in the Exploratron.

To start Little Kids Mode from within a scene, do the following:

- Click Tad, click Little Kids Mode, and then click On.

To start Little Kids Mode from within the Exploratron, do the following:

- Click Tad, then click Exit Exploratron. Once in the scene, click Tad, click
  Little Kids Mode, and then click On.

To start Little Kids Mode from within the Spaceship, do the following:

- Click Settings, click Little Kids Mode, and then and click On.
