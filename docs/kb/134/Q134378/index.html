SUMMARY
=======

This article covers the steps necessary to reset the mailbag for version 3.2 of
the Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks.

Notes:

- The following steps should be done if there is corruption or if the file is
  missing.

- Evidence of corruption include: a mail message that is being sent multiple
  times from PCMail to AppleTalk Mail, or messages that cannot be deleted from
  the MACNET/MACPO queue.

For additional information regarding these problems, and prior to following the
procedures of this article, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q119022 Message Redelivered Repeatedly to Mac Clients

NOTE: MACNET/MACPO will be used to represent the proxy network and postoffice
names throughout this article. These names can be different in specific
installations.

For additional information, please see the following articles in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

In version 3.2 of the Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks, there are
two queues created when the gateway is installed. One of these is for the proxy
postoffice; the other is for mail addressed using the gateway addressing method.
The gateway addressing method uses a queue identical to the queue for version
1.0b of the Connection Gateway.

Prior to recreating the MBG and KEY files for the proxy PO queue, the
administrator should return mail from the MACNET/MACPO queue.

1. Stop the Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks.

2. Run the Mail for PC Networks Administrator's program (ADMIN.EXE).

3. Select the Queue option, and select MACNET/MACPO from the list of network
  names.

  This will display messages that are in the queue.

4. Select the Return option, and use the spacebar to mark each message in the
  queue.

5. When you are finished marking the messages, press the RETURN key, and answer
  Yes to the Return Selected Times? prompt.

  NOTE: If more than fifty items are in the mailbag, repeat the procedure.

To recreate the queue, it is necessary to find the number of the queue for the
proxy PO. This number is kept in an XTN file on the postoffice.

1. Copy the NETWORK.GLB file to a local drive.

  WARNING! Be careful to work with the correct drive as the NETWORK.GLB file
  from one postoffice will not be the same as another.

2. Type out the NETWORK.GLB file from the MS-DOS prompt (use the MORE pipe if
  this is a large file and scrolls off the screen).

  NOTE: The network names will be followed by a short blank space and an eight
  digit number.

  Look for the MACNET name followed by a short space of less than 15 characters
  and an eight digit hex number. This number is part of the file name of an
  associated XTN file.

  The queue number will be found in an XTN file. Using the hex number of the
  NETWORK.GLB file, search the XTN directory for a file with this name (hexid)
  and the XTN extension.

3. Type out the &lt;hexid&gt;.XTN file.

4. Find MACPO followed by a short space and eight digit number. Write this
  number down as it is the &lt;HEXID&gt; of the actual queue that is to be
  reset.

Resetting the queue for the gateway involves resetting two files: the
&lt;HEXID&gt;.MBG and the &lt;HEXID&gt;.KEY.

NOTE: To allow for recovery, make a copy of the &lt;HEXID&gt;.MBG and
&lt;HEXID&gt;.KEY files prior to resetting them.


To create new .MBG and .KEY files:

1. From the Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE) menu, choose External-Admin,
  Create.

2. Create a new postoffice on an existing network, and then quit ADMIN.EXE.

3. Change to the MBG directory of the postoffice, and look for a 0-byte .MBG
  file with the current date and time.

  Write down the number of this MBG file that will be used to find the .KEY
  file.

To copy the new .MBG and .KEY files:

1. Copy the new 0-byte .MBG file over the corrupt .MBG file. You cannot use the
  MS-DOS COPY command to copy 0-byte files.

  On a Novell NetWare network, use NCOPY.

  On a LAN Manager-compatible network, use XCOPY.

2. Change to the KEY subdirectory of the postoffice; issue the MS-DOS DIR
  command to look for the new KEY file noted in step 3 above.

3. Copy the new 560 byte KEY file over the corrupt .KEY file.

4. In ADMIN.EXE, choose External-Admin, Delete; then delete the new postoffice
  that was created earlier.
