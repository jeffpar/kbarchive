-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a screen built in FoxPro version 2.x that contains a #REGION statement is
converted, the converter halts, and displays this error message:

  Variable 'GENDIRCOUNT' is not found

CAUSE
=====

This is an error in the Converter. The error occurs when the #REGION statement
is located in an object's code or in the Cleanup code - but not in the Setup
code. This causes the GENDIRCOUNT variable to be passed to a method when it was
not initialized.

WORKAROUND
==========

Edit the Converter code to initialize the GENDIRCOUNT variable. The source code
to the Converter application is included with the Professional Edition of Visual
FoxPro. The following step-by-step procedure illustrates the method to correct
the error.

Step-by-Step Workaround
-----------------------

1. Open the Convert.pjx project located in the Tools\Convert directory.

2. Select the Code tab. Drill down to view the Program, and select the Convert
  program. Click the Modify button to edit the file.

3. On the Edit menu, click Find, and in the Look For area of the dialog box,
  type FUNCTION AddMethods. Click Find. The Addmethods method is the one to
  modify.

4. The second line of code in the Addmethods method is this LOCAL statement:

        LOCAL cTmp, savearea, gendir, m.newmethod2

  Add the GENDIRCOUNT variable to this statement. It should now read:

        LOCAL cTmp, savearea, gendir, m.newmethod2, Gendircount

5. Close the Program, and save changes. Rebuild the Converter application.

6. In the Project Manager, click the Build button, and then click Build
  Application. The Save As dialog box is displayed.

7. In the Save As dialog box, select the main Visual FoxPro directory (VFP).

8. Click Save. The new application is built in your VFP directory.

You can verify the value of the _CONVERTER system memory variable to ensure that
it points to the correct location of the application.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual FoxPro 3.0b
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. In FoxPro for Windows, version 2.6, issue this command:

     CREATE SCREEN

2. In the screen's Cleanup code, place this code:

     #REGION 1
     Mvar1=2

     #REGION 2
     Mvar2=3

3. Save the screen.

4. In Visual FoxPro, on the File menu, click Open, and try to open the screen as
  a form.

5. The Converter is invoked. Select Functional Conversion, and Click the
  Continue button. The error is displayed and the screen is not converted.
