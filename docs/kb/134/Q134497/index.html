The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you minimize the Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing version 3.0 program, use the
right mouse button to click the program's button on the taskbar, and then click
Close on the menu that appears, the program may seem to stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

The program seems to hang because it has opened a dialog box prompting you to
confirm that you want to close it. However, the confirmation dialog box is
positioned off the screen where you cannot see it. The dialog box is positioned
of the screen because the program positions it relative to the minimized window,
which is positioned off the screen in Windows 95.

RESOLUTION
==========

Pressing SPACEBAR or Y should confirm that you want to close the program. To
prevent this situation from occurring, close the program from its own menus
instead of using the taskbar.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This situation may occur with other programs. If you have programs that exhibit
this behavior, close them using their own menus and commands instead of using
the taskbar to close them.
