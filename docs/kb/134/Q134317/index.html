-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Running setup on any 16-bit Windows platform (such as Windows 3.1 or Windows for
Workgroups 3.11), from distribution disks that were created with the Setup
Wizard, generates the following error:

  Bad Source File value in INF File Description line

CAUSE
=====

This error is caused by including files (or a single file) that have long file
names for distribution. If the executable was developed on a platform that
supports long file names, such as Windows 95 or Windows NT, it is fairly common
to include files with the application that take advantage of the long file name
capabilities of the operating system.

When the Setup Wizard creates the INF file that will be used in setting up the
application, the long file names are written into the INF file description
entries. When setup is run on a Windows platform that does not support long file
names, the setup program does not know how to interpret these files, and the
error occurs. After the error, a message is displayed stating that setup was
unsuccessful.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this error when installing an application on Windows platforms that do
not support long file names, ensure that all files included for distribution
adhere to the MS-DOS 8.3 file-naming conventions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create an application in Visual FoxPro on Windows 95 or Windows NT.

2. Include a file that has a long file name.

3. Run the Setup Wizard to create distribution disks.

4. After the disks have been created, try and run setup on a Windows platform
  that does not support long file names. The error will occur when setup is
  run.
