SYMPTOMS
========

When you load a copy of Winfax and try to print to the fax driver from your
16-bit Windows program that is configured to run in its own memory space,
another copy of Winfax is loaded and the following error message appears:

  MOD / An error has occurred in your application.

  &lt;Ignore&gt; &lt;Cancel&gt;

Regardless of which option you choose you are unable to get Winfax to work and
your system becomes unstable.

However, if the Winfax software is not set to auto-answer the modem, you may run
another serial program without a problem as the port is not in use by Winfax.
For example, if you run Windows Terminal and then to print to Winfax from
Windows WRITE.EXE, Winfax generates a "port in use" message as expected.


CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the Winfax driver selected in your program tries to
access the serial port and gets confused about which copy of the loaded Winfax
software to use.

The confusion occurs because your program is configured to run in its own memory
space causing the Winfax printer driver to load Winfax because it is unaware of
the Winfax copy that is already loaded.

This problem is unique to Winfax because if you select the Winfax printer driver
in a program and choose to print from that program, the Winfax printer driver
loads Winfax to complete the fax transmission.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Log off and on.

2. In Program Manager, select the program icon of the program you want to fax
  from and press ALT+ENTER.

  The Program Item Properties dialog box appears.

3. Clear the Run In Separate Memory Space check box and choose OK.

To correct this problem, install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51.

STATUS
======
