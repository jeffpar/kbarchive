SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to modify the layout of an address that you insert
when you use the Personal Address Book (PAB), Schedule+, or Microsoft Outlook
Contact List.

The address layout is determined by the AutoText entry "AddressLayout" This entry
may contain any predefined address property names between the angle brackets
(&lt;&gt;). Note that all of the following property names must be typed in
uppercase letters, for example

  {&lt;PR_GIVEN_NAME&gt;} {&lt;PR_SURNAME&gt;&lt;B6&gt;
  }{&lt;PR_COMPANY_NAME&gt;&lt;B6&gt;
  }{&lt;PR_STREET_ADDRESS&gt;&lt;B6&gt;
  }{&lt;PR_LOCALITY&gt;}, {&lt;PR_STATE_OR_PROVINCE&gt;
  }{&lt;PR_POSTAL_CODE&gt;&lt;B6&gt;}

where &lt;B6&gt; indicates that you should press ENTER on your keyboard. Also, the brace
characters ( { and } ) are typed from the keyboard and are not to be confused
with field braces (CTRL+F9). When you use the braces with the address layout
fields, if a field is blank when you import the address, Word automatically
suppresses the blank line.

NOTE: The "AddressLayout" format is limited to a maximum of 12 fields from a
Personal Address Book (PAB), Schedule+, or Microsoft Outlook Contact list.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To Create a New Format
----------------------

1. In a new Word document, type the predefined address property names (in
  uppercase letters) in the format you want to set up, for example

  {&lt;PR_GIVEN_NAME&gt;} {&lt;PR_SURNAME&gt;&lt;B6&gt;
  }{&lt;PR_COMPANY_NAME&gt;&lt;B6&gt;
  }{&lt;PR_STREET_ADDRESS&gt;&lt;B6&gt;
  }{&lt;PR_LOCALITY&gt;}, {&lt;PR_STATE_OR_PROVINCE&gt;
  }{&lt;PR_POSTAL_CODE&gt;&lt;B6&gt;}

  where &lt;B6&gt; indicates that you should press ENTER on your keyboard. Also, the
  brace characters ( { and } ) are typed from the keyboard and are not to be
  confused with field braces (CTRL+F9). When you use the braces with the
  address layout fields, if a field is blank when you import the address, Word
  automatically suppresses the blank line.

2. Select this text.

3. On the Insert menu, point to AutoText and then click New.

4. In the "Please name your AutoText entry" box, type "AddressLayout" (without
  the quotation marks).

  IMPORTANT NOTE: If you use a language-specific version of Microsoft Word, you
  must use the AddressLayout word that is specific for your language. The
  following are a few examples for some specific languages:

  Language   AutoText Entry Name
  ------------------------------

  English    AddressLayout
  Dutch      AdresIndeling
  French     MiseEnPageAdresse
  Italian    IndirizzoLayout
  German     AdreBlayout
  Danish     AdresseLayout

5. Click OK.

To Insert an Address Book Entry in Your Document
------------------------------------------------

1. Click the Insert Address button on the Standard toolbar.

  NOTE: The Insert Address button does not appear by default on the Standard
  toolbar. It does appear in the Envelopes, Labels, and Mail Merge dialog
  boxes. It is also included in several wizards such as the Letter Wizard. To
  add the button to a toolbar see the "How Add the Insert Address Button to the
  Toolbar" section later in this article.

2. Select a name from the list.

3. Click OK.

The address book entry should be inserted into your document in the format you
defined for your AutoText entry. However, if you receive the following error
message instead, modify the properties of the name you chose in step 2:

  There are no address fields in this address book. Pick the desired address
  book and try again.

NOTE: The properties are set incorrectly if both the first and last names appear
in the First box on the Business tab. (To access this option, first click the
Insert Address button, select the name, and then click Properties in the Select
Name dialog box.)

The error message also occurs if you enter the property names for the AutoText
entry in lowercase letters. To resolve this problem, change all the property
names to uppercase letters.
