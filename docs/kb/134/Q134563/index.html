-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a third-party keyboard enhancement Terminate and Stay Resident (TSR) program
is installed on the computer, you may be unable to shut down MS-DOS prompts. Any
of the following actions (and possibly others) may not shut down the MS-DOS
prompt:

- Shutting down the computer

- Closing all programs and logging off

- Clicking the X button in the corner of the MS-DOS prompt window

- Clicking the End Task button in the CTRL+ALT+DELETE dialog box

The title of the window says that the window is closing, but the window does not
close.

CAUSE
=====

The TSR does not implement the clean shut-down functionality, new in Windows 95.
As a result, Windows 95 waits forever for the TSR to shut down.

RESOLUTION
==========

For a long-term resolution, contact the vendor to see if an updated version of
the program is available.

To work around this behavior, click the MS-DOS prompt that is not shutting down,
and then at the MS-DOS prompt, type "exit" (without the quotation marks) to
cause it to quit properly.

To avoid having to do shut down the MS-DOS prompt in this manner repeatedly, use
one of the following two methods:

NOTE: By following these steps, any unsaved information in the MS-DOS prompt will
be lost.

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Taskbar on the menu
  that appears.

2. In the Taskbar Properties dialog box, click the Start Menu Programs tab, and
  then click the Advanced button.

3. In the Exploring - Start Menu dialog box, click the Programs folder.

4. Under Contents of Programs, using the right mouse button, click the MS-DOS
  Prompt icon, and then click Properties on the menu that appears.

5. In the MS-DOS Prompt Properties dialog box, click the Misc tab, and under
  Termination, make sure the "Warn if still active" box is not checked.

-or-

Remove the TSR from the Autoexec.bat file.
