The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade to Windows 95 with a Novell NE3200 network adapter, the first
time that you restart the computer, you may receive the following error message:
Your network adapter NE3200 or compatible (0000) is not working correctly. You
may need to set it up again.

CAUSE
=====


The error message described above seems to occur only when there is an EISA
device present on the computer during setup, and when there are NDIS3 drivers.
If the NE3200 card is added to an existing Windows 95 installation, this error
message does not appear.

RESOLUTION
==========

This error message does not adversely affect networking. If it appears, click
the OK button and allow Setup to complete. The next time you start the computer,
the error message does not appear and the card functions properly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows 95. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The NE3200 network adapter is manufactured by Novell, Inc., a vendor independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
product's performance or reliability.
