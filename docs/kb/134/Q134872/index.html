-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to save a PowerPoint for Windows 95 presentation as a PowerPoint 4.0
presentation, you might see the following error message:

  Sorry, either the filename is too long or PowerPoint cannot find or run the
  Viewer, which it needs to save in PowerPoint 4.0 format. If the filename is
  correct, you should run Setup, and re-install to get the Viewer.

Under certain conditions, the error message above may be preceded by this message
from Viewer:

  The path or filename is invalid.

This message occurs after you successfully import a PowerPoint version 4.0 for
the Macintosh file into PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0, save it as a
PowerPoint 7.0 file, and then try to resave the file as a PowerPoint 4.0 file.

Also, this error message can occur when you import a PowerPoint for the Macintosh
file that contains unsupported objects into PowerPoint 7.0.

CAUSE
=====

There are three possible causes for these error messages:

- PowerPoint Viewer is not installed.

- PowerPoint Viewer is currently in use.

- The path (including the filename) is larger than 256 characters.

The PowerPoint Viewer is required by PowerPoint 7.0 to save a presentation to
PowerPoint 4.0 format. If the PowerPoint Viewer is not installed or is currently
in use, PowerPoint 7.0 cannot save the file.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Check the Windows taskbar to see if PowerPoint Viewer is running. If it is
  running, close it, and then try to save again.

2. If Viewer is not currently running, check to see if Viewer is installed:
  a. Click the Windows Start button, point to Find, and then click Files Or
     Folders.

  b. Click the Name &amp; Location tab.

  c. In the Named box, type "pptview.exe" (without the quotation marks).

  d. In the Look In box, change to the drive where PowerPoint is installed.

  e. Click Find Now.

  If the search results produce no files, PowerPoint Viewer is not currently
  installed. To install Viewer, you must rerun PowerPoint Setup (or Office
  Setup).

3. If you still can't save the file, count the characters in the full path
  (including the filename) you are trying to use. If the path contains more
  than 256 characters, try giving the presentation a shorter name or saving it
  to another folder that has a shorter name.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in PowerPoint for Windows 95,
version 7.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
