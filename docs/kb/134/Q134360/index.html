SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Microsoft Exchange, or click the Inbox button on the Microsoft
Exchange toolbar, you may receive the following error message:

  The command you specified could not be carried out. A default set of folders
  could not be found. Your active profile must include such a set, such as a
  personal folder file.

When you click OK, Microsoft Exchange seems to work properly. However, when you
open a message in the Inbox folder, or try to compose a new message, you may
receive the following error message:

  The item could not be displayed. A default set of folders could not be found.
  Your active profile must include such a set, such as a personal folder file.

CAUSE
=====

The errors described above can occur when any of the following conditions
exists:

- You do not have a set of personal folders or a personal information store in
  your active profile.

- You do have a set of personal folders or a personal information store in your
  active profile, but the "Deliver new mail to the following location" field is
  set to None.

- You have removed the default message store, leaving only the secondary
  message store (such as personal folders or another personal information
  store) in your active profile.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the problem, use the appropriate method. Note that all of the methods
involve configuring your active profile in Microsoft Exchange.

Method 1: No Personal Folders or Personal Information Store
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. On the Services tab, click Add.

3. Click Personal Folders, and then click OK.

4. In the File Name box, click the appropriate .pst file, and then click Open.
  (The file is usually named Mailbox.pst and is located in the Exchange
  folder.)

5. If the .pst file is password-protected, type the password and then click OK.

6. In the Personal Folders dialog box, click OK.

7. In the properties for the active profile, click OK.

Method 2: "Deliver New Mail to..." Field Set to None
----------------------------------------------------

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. Click the Deliver tab.

3. In the "Deliver new mail to the following location" box, click either
  Personal Folders or Personal Information Store.

4. Click OK.

Method 3: Removed Default Message Store
---------------------------------------

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. On the Services tab, click Add.

3. Click Personal Folders, and then click OK.

4. Click the Appropriate .pst file, and then click Open.

  NOTE: There may be more than one .pst file. You should click the default
  message store, which is usually called Mailbox.pst and is located in the
  Exchange folder.

5. If the .pst file is password-protected, type the password and then click OK.

6. In the Personal Folders dialog box, click OK.

7. In the properties for the active profile, click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

"Personal information store" and "My information" are interchangeable terms.
They both contain Inbox, Outbox, Deleted Items, and Sent folders. These folders
are necessary for a correct default message store. The default message store is
literally the first information store added to a profile. Personal folders is
designed as a secondary message store and contains only a Deleted Items folder.
