SYMPTOMS
========

The Palindrome Network Archivist backup tool version 3.x does not work with the
Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks to back up files to a tape drive on a
NetWare server.

CAUSE
=====

Network Archivist requires Novell's Tsasms.com terminate-and-stay-resident
program (TSR) to function in Windows 95. The Tsasms.com TSR must be loaded in
the Autoexec.bat file after Lsl.com and Ipxodi.com.

This backup tool works with either the NETX or the VLM NetWare client as long as
IPXODI and an ODI driver are already loaded when the Tsasms.com TSR is loaded
into memory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use any one of the following methods:

- Contact Palindrome for additional information.

- Use the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks with an ODI network adapter
  driver. Refer to the Microsoft Windows 95 "Resource Kit," chapter 9, "Windows
  95 on NetWare Networks," for additional information.

- Use a real-mode NetWare client from Novell (VLM or NETX) with IPXODI.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Network Archivist is currently implemented as a TSR to be loaded at the MS-DOS
level. Because of this, it is not aware of the Windows 95 registry or of long
filenames.

Palindrome is reported to be working on a version of Network Archivist that will
support long filenames and be aware of the registry. Windows 95 support should
be included in Network Archivist 4.0 for Windows NT when it is released.
