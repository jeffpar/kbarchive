SUMMARY
=======

When the variable buff has been declared in an assembly-language program, such
as the following:

       .data
       public buff
_buff   db 200 dup (0xab)
       .data ends

there is a difference between the two following C declarations:

  extern unsigned char buff[];

  extern unsigned *buff;

The difference is that the first declaration says there is a block of memory that
is named buff; the second says there is something called buff that is a
pointer.

This difference can be seen by referencing buff as follows:

  buff[x]

If buff is declared as an array, the referencing is correct.

However, if buff is declared as a pointer, the referencing is incorrect. The data
pointed to by buff (ab in this example) is translated into a memory address,
then x bytes are added to it generating an incorrect reference.
