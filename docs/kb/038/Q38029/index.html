- Microsoft Windows versions 2.03, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive either of the following error messages when you start Microsoft
Windows in 386 enhanced mode:

  WARNING: The Intel 80386 CPU in this computer does not reliably execute
  32-bit operations. Windows will usually work correctly on computers with this
  problem, but may occasionally fail.

  WARNING: the Intel 80386 processor in the computer does not reliably execute
  32-bit multiply operations, Windows usually works correctly on computers with
  this problem but may occasionally fail, you may want to replace your 80386
  processor. Press any key to continue.

CAUSE
=====

When Intel introduced the 80386 CPU, it released some chips that had not been
fully tested using 32-bit operations. Windows checks for this to warn you that
you may want to replace the CPU with one of the newer, more reliable 80386
chips.

This is normally not a problem, as most programs do not use the true 32- bit
capabilities of the 80386 CPU. However, since Windows does use 32-bit
operations, you may experience problems.

WORKAROUND
==========

Windows 2.x
-----------

Two important files come with enhanced-mode Windows, WIN386.EXE and WIN86.COM.
WIN386.EXE provides memory management and support for standard applications;
WIN86.COM is essentially the same as Windows/286 without support for standard
applications. After WIN386.EXE is loaded, it creates a virtual machine, loads
WIN86.COM, and executes it.

If the problem seems to be resolved by running WIN86.COM instead of WIN386.EXE,
you may need to replace the CPU in your computer. If Windows acts the same with
either WIN386.EXE or WIN86.COM, the problem is probably not related to the CPU.

Windows 3.0, 3.1, and 3.11 and Windows for Workgroups 3.1 and 3.11
------------------------------------------------------------------

You must upgrade the 80386 CPU in your computer to work around this problem.
