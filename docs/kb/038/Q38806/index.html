The L2002 error below is from "Linker Error Messages" in the manual
"CodeView and Utilities," Section C.2, Page 366, and in the "Microsoft
QuickC Compiler Programmer's Guide," Section D.4, Page 372.

The following is the error:

L2002       fixup overflow near number in frame seg segname target seg
            segname target offset number

            The following conditions can cause this error:

            A small-model program is compiled with the /NT option.

            A group is larger than 64K.

            The program contains an intersegment short jump or
            intersegment short call.

            The name of a data item in the program conflicts with
            that of a subroutine in a library included in the
            link.

            An EXTRN declaration in an assembly-language source
            file appeared inside the body of a segment, as in the
            following example:

                code   SEGMENT public 'CODE'
                       EXTRN   main:far
                start  PROC    far
                       call    main
                       ret
                start  ENDP
                code   ENDS

                The following construction is preferred:

                       EXTRN   main:far
                code   SEGMENT public 'CODE'
                start  PROC    far
                       call    main
                       ret
                start  ENDP
                code   ENDS

            Revise the source file and recreate the object file. (For
            information about frame and target segments, refer to the
            "Microsoft MS-DOS Programmer's Reference.")

Nonfatal errors indicate problems in the executable file. LINK
produces the executable file. Nonfatal error messages have the
following format:

   location : error L2xxx: messagetext

In these messages, location is the input file associated with the
error, or LINK if there is no input file. If the input file is an OBJ
or LIB file and has a module name, the module name is enclosed in
parentheses.

Force data outside of DGROUP by using the /Gt compiler switch along
with a large data model (compact, large, or huge).

Using the linker switch /CO twice can cause this. For example, when
LINK is invoked with /CO when a LINK environment variable is also set
to /CO, then this situation results.
