SYMPTOMS
========

If an ActiveX Data Objects data control (ADODC) is bound to a Microsoft Access
table that specifies a default value for the numeric field, when you take the
following actions:

1. Add a new record to the ADO recordset, which the ADODC exposes, without
  entering a value for that numeric field.

2. Update the recordset.

3. Type a value into the numeric field (either directly into the Recordset field
  or into the corresponding DataGrid cell) in that same newly-added record.

4. Update the recordset again.

the following run-time error is raised with error number -2147217864 (80040e38)
or 6153:

  Row cannot be located for updating. Some values may have changed since it was
  last read.

If a DataGrid control is bound to the ADODC, the same error message usually
appears a second time without an error number in a dialog box that is entitled
"Microsoft DataGrid Control."

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, remove the default value that is specified for the
numeric field in the Access database table.

Alternately, you can run an UPDATE statement on a separate ADO Connection object
to update the numeric field in the newly-added record directly in the database
and then refresh the ADODC.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Note that this bug is not a duplicate of the issue that is described in the
following Knowledge Base article:

  Q294842 PRB: Error When You Update or Delete New Rows in Access 97 Table

The same error message occurs with Access 97 databases because ADO does not
retrieve the AutoNumber values correctly for newly-added records. The bug that
is described in the present article occurs with later versions of Access
(including Access 2002), and the AutoNumber primary key values for newly-added
records are present in the recordset.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create an empty Access database named db1.mdb in a folder that you intend to
  use for this test.

2. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
  default.

3. If necessary, add the ADO data control and DataGrid to the toolbox.

4. Add an ADODC, a DataGrid, and six Command buttons to Form1.

5. Paste the following code into the code module of Form1:

  Option Explicit

  Private Sub Command1_Click()
      Dim cn As ADODB.Connection
      Dim strCreate
      Set cn = New ADODB.Connection
      cn.Open "Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;" &amp; _
          "Data Source=" &amp; App.Path &amp; "\db1.mdb"
      On Error Resume Next
      cn.Execute "DROP TABLE InsertTest", , adExecuteNoRecords
      On Error GoTo 0
      strCreate = "CREATE TABLE InsertTest (TestID int identity not null primary key," &amp; _
                  "TestValue int default 0, TestOther varchar(16))"
      Debug.Print strCreate
      cn.Execute strCreate, , adExecuteNoRecords
      cn.Execute "INSERT INTO InsertTest (TestValue, TestOther) VALUES (1, 'John')"
      cn.Execute "INSERT INTO InsertTest (TestValue, TestOther) VALUES (2, 'Mary')"
      cn.Close
      Set cn = Nothing
  End Sub

  Private Sub Command2_Click()
      Dim cn As ADODB.Connection
      Dim strCreate
      Set cn = New ADODB.Connection
      cn.Open "Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;" &amp; _
          "Data Source=" &amp; App.Path &amp; "\db1.mdb"
      On Error Resume Next
      cn.Execute "DROP TABLE InsertTest", , adExecuteNoRecords
      On Error GoTo 0
      strCreate = "CREATE TABLE InsertTest (TestID int identity not null primary key," &amp; _
                  "TestValue int, TestOther varchar(16))"
      Debug.Print strCreate
      cn.Execute strCreate, , adExecuteNoRecords
      cn.Execute "INSERT INTO InsertTest (TestValue, TestOther) VALUES (1, 'John')"
      cn.Execute "INSERT INTO InsertTest (TestValue, TestOther) VALUES (2, 'Mary')"
      cn.Close
      Set cn = Nothing
  End Sub

  Private Sub Command3_Click()
      With Adodc1
          .ConnectionString = "Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;" &amp; _
              "Data Source=" &amp; App.Path &amp; "\db1.mdb"
          .RecordSource = "SELECT * FROM InsertTest"
          .Refresh
      End With
      Set DataGrid1.DataSource = Adodc1
  End Sub

  Private Sub Command4_Click()
      With Adodc1.Recordset
          .AddNew
          .Fields("TestOther").Value = "Joe"
          .Update
          .Fields("TestValue").Value = 1
          .Update
      End With
  End Sub

  Private Sub Command5_Click()
      With DataGrid1
          .Row = Adodc1.Recordset.RecordCount
          .Columns(2).Value = "Jane"
          .Row = .Row - 1
          .Row = .Row + 1
          .Columns(1).Value = 123
          .Row = .Row - 1
      End With
      Set DataGrid1.DataSource = Adodc1
  End Sub

  Private Sub Command6_Click()
      Set DataGrid1.DataSource = Nothing
      DataGrid1.ClearFields
      With Adodc1.Recordset
          .AddNew
          .Fields("TestOther").Value = "Joe"
          .Update
          .Fields("TestValue").Value = 1
          .Update
      End With
      MsgBox "Update completed."
  End Sub

  Private Sub Form_Load()
      Command1.Caption = "Create Table with Default"
      Command2.Caption = "Create Table without Default"
      Command3.Caption = "Load Recordset"
      Command4.Caption = "Test Recordset Update"
      Command5.Caption = "Test Grid Cell Update"
      Command6.Caption = "Test Update without Grid"
      DataGrid1.AllowAddNew = True
  End Sub

6. Run the project. Click Create Table with Default, click Load Recordset, and
  then click Test Recordset Update. This updates the numeric field in a
  newly-added record in the ADODC recordset. It raises run-time error
  -2147217864 (80040e38), which is followed by a DataGrid error. Both of these
  errors contain the following message:

  Row cannot be located for updating. Some values may have changed since it was
  last read.

7. Run the project again. Click Create Table with Default, click Load Recordset,
  and then click Test Grid Cell Update. This updates the DataGrid cell that
  corresponds to the numeric field in a newly-added record in the ADODC
  recordset. It raises run-time error 6153, which is followed by a DataGrid
  error. Both of these errors contain the following message:

  Row cannot be located for updating. Some values may have changed since it was
  last read.

8. Run the project again. Click Create Table with Default, click Load Recordset,
  and then click Test Update without Grid. This updates the numeric field in a
  newly-added record in the ADODC recordset without using the DataGrid. It
  raises only the run-time error -2147217864 (80040e38), which displays the
  following message:

  Row cannot be located for updating. Some values may have changed since it was
  last read.

9. Run the project again. Click Create Table without Default, click Load
  Recordset, and then click each of the last three buttons. In each case, the
  newly-added record is successfully updated because the default value is no
  longer specified on the problem numeric field in the Access table.
