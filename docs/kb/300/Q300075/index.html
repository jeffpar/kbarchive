SYMPTOMS
========

When users edit Passport core profile data on a site, the changes are not saved.

RESOLUTION
==========

If Passport users have difficulty saving changes to their profile, review the
following items:

1. Is your site currently in test mode (Site ID=1)? A test mode site can change
  the values of a core profile locally in order to demonstrate the use of the
  Profile property and Commit method, but the changes are not uploaded to the
  Passport profile data server.

2. Have you fully completed the registration process, including installation of
  your site's encryption keys and Site ID? Updates from an unknown Site ID or
  from a URL that does not fall within the RootURL domain for a known Site ID
  are rejected.

3. Does your code validate changes to a user's core profile data against the
  rules as listed in the Core Profile Table? The Passport update code
  individually isolates the updates rather than summarily rejecting them all if
  a single one fails, but you should still attempt to validate all input.

4. Does the code on your Passport pages call both the Commit and LogoTag2
  methods of the Passport Manager object to commit the changes to the Passport
  Update server? A new Passport Manager object created on another page that
  calls the LogoTag2 method does not have the values from the previous
  instance's Commit method that are needed to save to the Passport Update
  server.

5. Does your code call both the Commit method and the LogoTag2 method of
  Passport Manager on the same page before writing any headers, cookies, HTML,
  or HTML-generating script to the browser? This usually requires that data be
  collected on one page of your site, then posted (using the HTTP POST method)
  to another page on your site. The second page does nothing but handle the
  form input, set that input to the Profile property, call Commit, and then
  call LogoTag2 before any other Passport Manager method or HTML output. When
  exchanging Passport data updates, use a POST for the form's method; do not
  exchange this information between your pages as a GET query string.

6. Does your code call the HasProfile, HasTicket, or IsAuthenticated methods of
  Passport Manager before writing to the Profile property for the user? An
  attempt to write profile data to the Passport server for a user who has not
  signed in and who does not have valid Ticket data in the query string or
  cookie does not give any results. An error does not result and your script
  does not receive any indication that the write operation did not succeed.

7. Are you attempting to set a read-only attribute?

Development Kit (SDK) at the following Passport Web site:
