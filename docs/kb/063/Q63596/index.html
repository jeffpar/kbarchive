-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following is a list of the PS/2 BIOS problems corrected by the various
versions of IBM's DASDDRVR.SYS patch file:

- Intermittent

  Not ready error reading drive A:

- Intermittent

  General failure

  errors reading a fixed disk drive

- 

  Track 0 bad, or invalid media

  when formatting multiple 3.5-inch disks

- 301 and 8602 errors when the system is powered off and on quickly

- 162 and 163 errors with loss of date and time

- Being prompted for password (on warm boot) even though password security is
  not implemented or incorrectly told password already exists when installing
  the power-on password function

MORE INFORMATION
================

The first three corrections listed above were originally provided on the PC- DOS
version 3.3 patch disk. The DASDDRVR.SYS file (also called DOS33FIX) was 648
bytes.

The next two corrections were added in the next version, which was 698 bytes, and
included on all version 1.02 Reference Disks (50/60 and 70/80).

The last correction was added on all 50/60 and 70/80 Reference Disks, versions
1.03 or later. It is now up to 734 bytes.

PS/2 Models Affected
--------------------

The IBM System Update Diskette, DASDDRVR.SYS version 1.56, affects the following
PS/2 models: 30-286, 50, 50Z, 55SX, 60, 70, 80, and PC-DOS 3.3 and 4.0.

DASDDRVR's Load Procedure
-------------------------

When the DASDDRVR patch is loaded from CONFIG.SYS, it looks at the system model
ID and submodel bytes, as well as the BIOS date. If these don't match what it is
looking for, DASDDRVR doesn't even apply the patches. All you do is waste a
small piece of disk space. Later versions of DASDDRVR than those mentioned here
may apply to other model PS/2 machines. When in doubt, load DASDDRVR.

NOTE: DASDDRVR.SYS should not be loaded high.

Notes on Use of DASDDRVR.SYS with Windows
-----------------------------------------

Proper functioning of Microsoft Windows (all versions) and all Windows
applications requires that DASDDRVR.SYS be loaded upon installing and running
these programs as described here.

Note on PS/2 Model 30-286
-------------------------

The 30-286 also has a DASDDRVR.SYS, but this is not the same DASDDRVR file and
corrects entirely different problems. The Model 55 Reference Disk does
(unintentionally) contain the 734-byte DASDDRVR file, but it is not needed.

Obtaining the IBM PS/2 System Update Diskette
---------------------------------------------

You can obtain the free IBM PS/2 System Update Diskette from IBM PC Books and
Software.

These facts were obtained from the IBM National Support Center PC User's Group
Bulletin Board. For more information on DASDDRVR.SYS, please contact your local
IBM representative.

Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
