SUMMARY
=======

The "Crash" option of the SIM menu may be turned off by the Flight Simulator
program when using SubLogic Scenery disks.

This problem occurs when Flight Simulator is in its default settings (Meigs
field) and the Scenery disk is selected before the plane has started to move. If
custom modes have been created, this information may no longer be true.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Flight Simulator version 4.00, when SubLogic Scenery disks 1-6, Japanese, San
Francisco, and Hawaii are used, the "Crash" option will be set to OFF by Flight
Simulator when the plane starts to move. When SubLogic Scenery disks 7 and above
are used with Flight Simulator version 4.00, the "Crash" option is NOT changed
from the default setting of DETECT.

When Flight Simulator version 3.00 is used with SubLogic Scenery disks 1-6,
Japanese, San Francisco, and Hawaii, the "Crash" option is left at DETECT and
the plane crashes almost instantly. The crash occurs because the current
coordinates on the scenery disk are over water. When SubLogic Scenery disks 7
and above are used with Flight Simulator version 3.00, the "Crash" option is
left at DETECT; however, the plane does not crash because the current
coordinates are not over water.
