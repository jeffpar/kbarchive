.RTLink is a third-party linker made by Pocket Soft, Inc., that allows
overlay support for QuickBASIC versions 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50, and
enhanced overlay support for Microsoft BASIC Professional Development
System (PDS) version 7.00. .RTLink allows the following overlay
enhancements that are currently not available with QuickBASIC or
BASIC PDS 7.00:

1. Overlay support in QuickBASIC 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50 or BASIC
   compiler 6.00 and 6.00b.

2. Up to two more additional run-time modules (such as the
   BRUNnxxx.EXE or BRT70xxx.EXE run-time modules).

3. Multiple overlay areas. Overlays in BASIC PDS 7.00 are limited to
   just one overlayable area of memory.

4. Overlays calling overlays that use the same overlay area (nested
   overlay calls).

DISCLAIMER: .RTLink is manufactured by Pocket Soft, Inc., a vendor
independent of Microsoft. Microsoft makes no warranty, implied or
otherwise, regarding the performance or reliability of .RTLink. You
are responsible for double-checking any information on which you base
a financial decision. Contact your dealer or the product manufacturer
to verify information.

This information applies to Microsoft QuickBASIC versions 4.00, 4.00b,
and 4.50, to Microsoft BASIC Compiler versions 6.00 and 6.00b for
MS-DOS, and to Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS)
version 7.00 for MS-DOS.

The first version of .RTLink that works with BASIC PDS 7.00 is .RTLink
version 3.11. Earlier versions of .RTLink can create overlays with
QuickBASIC 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50, and BASIC Compiler 6.00 and 6.00b,
but not with BASIC PDS 7.00. Please note that Microsoft has not tested
.RTLink with these products and therefore cannot guarantee
compatibility.
