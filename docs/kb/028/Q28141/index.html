Question:
   I have an OS/2 application (an analog simulator with postprocessor)
that is ready to go, with the exception of the GRAPHICS output. I have
been having difficulties getting graphics to work under OS/2. Can you
give me any suggestions on how to use graphics?

Response:
   The first problem is to get "addressability" to the video RAM. This
is accomplished by using the VioGetPhysBuf API. For an EGA monitor the
calling sequence would be as follows:

struct    PhysBufData physbuf;
char  far *base1, far *base2;

     physbuf.buf_start = 0xa0000;
     physbuf.buf_length = 0x20000;
     rcode = VIOGETPHYSBUF (&amp;physbuf, 0);
     FP_SEG (base1) = physbuf.selectors[0];
     FP_OFF (base1) = 0;
     FP_SEG (base2) = physbuf.selectors[1];
     FP_OFF (base2) = 0;

where base1 is the first 64K of memory on the EGA card, and base2
would be the next 64K of memory. If you wanted to access more than
128K you would have to increase the length and allocate space for more
physbuf.selectors. (Look up this API.)
   Once you have valid pointers to the video memory, you still have
more limitations. You can (should) not use these pointers unless your
application is in the foreground. You must (should) inform the
operating system before using the pointers. You use the API VioScrLock
to lock your process into the foreground while you are writing to
video memory. Once you are done writing to the video memory you must
call VioScrUnLock, to re-enable screen switching. You should not keep
the screen locked on any more time then absolutely necessary. (See
this API for restrictions.) If your application attempts to write to
the video memory when it is not in the foreground, it will gp_fault.
   Since your application is putting the monitor into graphics mode,
it is its responsibility to save and restore the monitor's contents
and mode. The application will have to use the API's VioSavRedrawWait
and VioModeWait. VioSavRedrawWait is for the notification of when you
should save or restore your screen image. VioModeWait is notified when
you should save and restore video modes.
   Finally, if you plan to use I/O ports with your program you will
have to "flag" it as needing IOPL (input/output privilege level). You
do this by putting "CODE IOPL" in the program's definition file, and
in config.os2 "IOPL=YES".

API's to review:
     VioGetPhysBuf
     VioScrLock
     VioScrUnLock
     VioModeWait
     VioRedrawWait
