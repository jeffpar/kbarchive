-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft LINK for MS-DOS, versions 5.0x, 5.1x, 5.3, 5.31.009, 5.6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The LINK error "fatal error L1085: cannot open temporary file" is received when
linking a program consisting of many object modules. When rebooting and making
more room in RAM, the error does not occur.

CAUSE
=====

The linker error has nothing to do with available RAM. The fact that the linker
worked when the machine is rebooted can be due to any one of several areas of
concern:

- The removal of resident software upon rebooting may have removed some
  interference. Microsoft does not guarantee that its products will work
  correctly with TSR (terminate-and-stay-resident) software. A TSR can
  interfere with the finding of the TMP environment variable, so the temporary
  file will not be created.

- Insufficient file handles can cause this error. The CONFIG.SYS file should
  have the setting, files=20. Some of the handles may have been freed upon
  rebooting without the TSRs. If the disk is full, leaving no room for a
  temporary file to be created, this error will occur.

- This error can also occur if the TMP environment variable is not set up
  correctly or is pointing to a directory that is full.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with the Microsoft LINK Utility for
MS-DOS, versions 5.0x, 5.1x, 5.3, 5.31.009, and 5.6. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
