The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Complete Baseball for Windows, version 1994 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article provides instructions to manually set up Microsoft Complete
Baseball for Windows.

This installation is equivalent to the Fast setup option, which requires 6
megabytes (MB) of disk space and provides the fastest performance.

These instructions assume:

- Your hard disk drive is drive C.

- Your destination folder (directory) is C:\Baseball

- Your Windows folder is C:\Windows

- Your CD-ROM drive is drive D.

If your hard disk drive, destination folder, Windows folder, and/or CD-ROM drive
letters and directories are different, replace the drive letters and folder
names throughout this article with the drive letters and folder names on your
computer.

NOTE: The following manual installation instructions discuss copying, editing,
and modifying directories and files. For more information about accomplishing
these tasks in Windows, see your Windows printed documentation or online Help.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Create a directory named Baseball and a subdirectory named Baseball\Daily on
  drive C. For example, from the MS-DOS command prompt on drive C, type the
  following and press ENTER:

  "MD C:\BASEBALL" (without the quotation marks)

  Then type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER:

  prompt. Allow MS-DOS to overwrite any files it finds already on your hard
  disk drive:

  NOTE: If you are using Windows 95 and get a message stating that the file you
  are trying to copy to the system is older than the one on the system, do not
  let Windows change it.
  a. Copy all the files from the D:\Zzsystem directory on your Baseball 1994 CD
     to the C:\Windows\System directory.
