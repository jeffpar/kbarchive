-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft FoxPro for Windows Distribution Kit, versions 2.5x, 2.6x 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SETUP.EXE in the FoxPro for Windows Distribution Kit, specifically the SETUP.APP
Setup Wizard, does not successfully measure the amount of disk space on the
destination system before beginning the actual installation of the application.
This is despite the message SETUP displays saying that it will check for
available disk space.

If the destination drive does not have enough free disk space, SETUP proceeds
until it encounters a situation in which the available space is less than that
required to expand and load the next file from the distribution disk. When this
situation occurs, SETUP displays the error message "Cannot Write
&lt;filename&gt;."

WORKAROUND
==========

Use one of the following workarounds:

1. At an MS-DOS prompt, type the following:

           C:\FPW26\DKSETUP\DECOMP DISK1\SETUP.MS_ C:\SETUP.MST
           EDIT C:\SETUP.MST

2. From the Search menu choose Find.

3. In the Find dialog box, "type dialogs%" (without the quotation marks).

4. Change the text dialogs% to "dialog%" (without the quotation marks).

5. Save and close the file.

6. At an MS-DOS prompt, type the following:

  C:\FPW26\DKSETUP\COMPRESS C:\SETUP.MST DISK1\SETUP.MS_

  The Setup Wizard will now work properly.

-or-

- Developers using the Distribution Kit for FoxPro for Windows should include
  documentation with their distributed applications advising the end user of
  the amount of hard disk space required to install the application. This space
  requirement is in addition to the space required for the end user's tables
  and working storage.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual FoxPro 3.0
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Copy the MS-DOS directory into the FoxPro directory.

2. Package this MS-DOS directory, specifying ATTRIB.EXE as the master program.
  Answer the Setup Wizard's questions by selecting the suggested default
  values. Specify the appropriate size of floppy disks for the destination
  machine (for example, 1.44 MB). Include in the distribution file set the
  appropriate .ESL library for the release of FoxPro on the source machine.
  (The wizard will request this.)

3. Copy the files within the disk images to the appropriate sized disks. The
  combined files will require approximately 6 MB of disk space.

4. Fill the hard disk of the destination machine with enough copies of FPW26 (or
  some other directory) to reduce the available space to less than the file
  requirements of the distributed application (MS-DOS).

5. From the Windows File menu, choose Run, and run SETUP from the floppy drive
  into which the distribution disks fit.
