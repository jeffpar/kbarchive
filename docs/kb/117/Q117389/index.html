SUMMARY
=======

The following chart lists the exceptions that can be generated by the Intel
80286, 80386, 80486, and Pentium processors:

Exception | Description
(dec/hex) |
----------|-------------------------------------------------
 0  00h  | Divide error:
         | Occurs during a DIV or an IDIV instruction when the
         | divisor is zero or a quotient overflow occurs.

 1  01h  | Single-step/debug exception:
         | Occurs for any of a number of conditions:
         | - Instruction address breakpoint fault
         | - Data address breakpoint trap
         | - General detect fault
         | - Single-step trap
         | - Task-switch breakpoint trap

 2  02h  | Nonmaskable interrupt:
         | Occurs because of a nonmaskable hardware interrupt.

 3  03h  | Breakpoint:
         | Occurs when the processor encounters an INT 3 instruction.

 4  04h  | Overflow:
         | Occurs when the processor encounters an INTO instruction
         | and the OF (overflow) flag is set.

 5  05h  | Bounds check (BOUND instruction):
         | Occurs when the processor, while executing a BOUND
         | instruction, finds that the operand exceeds the specified
         | limit.

 6  06h  | Invalid opcode:
         | Occurs when an invalid opcode is detected.

 7  07h  | Coprocessor not available:
         | Occurs for one of two conditions:
         | - The processor encounters an ESC (escape) instruction
         |   and the EM (emulate) bit of CR0 (control register zero)
         |   is set.
         | - The processor encounters either the WAIT instruction or
         |   an ESC instruction and both the MP (monitor
         |   coprocessor) and TS (task switched) bits of CR0 are set.

 8  08h  | Double fault:
         | Occurs when the processor detects an exception while
         | trying to invoke the handler for a prior exception.

 9  09h  | Coprocessor segment overrun:
         | Occurs when a page or segment violation is detected while
         | transferring the middle portion of a coprocessor operand
         | to the NPX.

10  0Ah  | Invalid TSS:
         | Occurs if, during a task switch, the new TSS is invalid.

11  0Bh  | Segment not present:
         | Occurs when the processor detects that the present bit of
         | a descriptor is zero.

12  0Ch  | Stack exception:
         | Occurs for one of two conditions:
         | - As a result of a limit violation in any operation that
         |   refers to SS (stack segment register)
         | - When attempting to load SS with a descriptor that is
         |   marked as not-present but is otherwise valid

13  0Dh  | General protection violation:
         | Each protection violation that does not cause another
         | exception causes a general protection exception.
         | - Exceeding segment limit when using CS, DS, ES, FS, or GS
         | - Exceeding segment limit when referencing a descriptor
         |   table
         | - Transferring control to a segment that is not executable
         | - Writing to a read-only data segment or a code segment
         | - Reading from an execute-only segment
         | - Loading SS with a read-only descriptor
         | - Loading SS, DS, ES, FS, or GS with a descriptor of a system
         |   segment
         | - Loading DS, ES, FS, or GS with the descriptor of an
         |   executable segment that is also not readable
         | - Loading SS with the descriptor of an executable segment
         | - Accessing memory through DS, ES, FS, or GS when the segment
         |   register contains a NULL selector
         | - Switching to a busy task
         | - Violating privilege rules
         | - Loading CR0 with PG=1 and PE=0
         | - Interrupt or exception through trap or interrupt gate from
         |   V86 mode to a privilege level other than 0

14  0Eh  | Page fault:
         | Occurs when paging is enabled (PG=1) and the processor
         | detects one of the following conditions while translating
         | a linear address to a physical address:
         | - The page-directory or page-table entry needed for the
         |   address translation has 0 in its present bit.
         | - The current procedure does not have sufficient privilege
         |   to access the indicated page.

15  0Fh  | (Reserved)

16  10h  | Coprocessor error:
         | Occurs when the processor detects a signal from the
         | coprocessor on the ERROR# input pin.

17  11h  | (Reserved)
through  |
31  1Fh  |
