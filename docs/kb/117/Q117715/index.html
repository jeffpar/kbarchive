-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Data transfers across a source routing bridge are very slow or appear to hang.

CAUSE
=====

Windows for Workgroups (NetBEUI protocol) over a Token Ring Source Routing
Bridge advertises a Largest Frame (LF) size of 8130 bytes. However, the Maxframe
size is negotiated at 156 bytes. This causes very slow data transfer.

A network trace illustrates the problem:

  Destination   Source        Summary
  Server      WFWClient&lt;00&gt;   NETB D=2B S=16 Session initialize

  NETB: ----- NETBIOS Session Initialize -----
  NETB:
  NETB: Header length = 14, Data length = 0
  NETB: Delimiter = EFFF (NETBIOS)
  NETB: Command = 19
  NETB: Flags = 89
  NETB: 1... .... = NO.ACK ability

  NETB: .... 100. = Largest frame value = 4 &lt;&lt;&lt;8130 bytes -IBM Spec

  NETB: .... ...1 = Version 2.0 or higher

  NETB: Max data receive size = 156     &lt;&lt;&lt; Small Frame size negotiated.

  NETB: Transmit correlator = 0000
  NETB: Response correlator = 0016
  NETB: Remote session number = 43
  NETB: Local session number = 22

If the bridge advertises a size OTHER THAN 8130 bytes, this problem does not
occur.

WORKAROUND
==========

An updated NETBEUI.386 file is available to correct this problem. Replace your
existing NETBEUI.386 file with the updated version. For information about how to
obtain the updated driver, refer to the More Information section below.

The following options allow you to work around this problem:

- Use the real-mode NetBEUI protocol.

  -or-

- Execute "Net start Full" at the command prompt before running Windows for
  Workgroups.

  -or-

- Configure the bridge by changing a Largest Frame size (smaller or larger).

  In a case where an IBM software bridge is used to connect two 16 MB rings, it
  is not possible to change the LF size on the bridge software. In this case,
  you can bring down the network ring to 4 MB, or install a hardware bridge.

NOTE: This problem does not occur on LAN Manager/Windows workstations.
