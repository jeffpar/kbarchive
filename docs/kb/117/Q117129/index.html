-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Windows and Windows for Workgroups, the application icons within
Program Manager cannot be moved.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if any of the following conditions exist:

- The group files are marked with the Hidden, System, and/or Read-Only
  attribute(s).

  -or-

- The EditLevel= entry in the PROGMAN.INI file is set to 2 or higher.

  -or-

- The active field for the icon is larger than the distance being moved.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, use the appropriate method below.

- Remove the Hidden, Read-Only, and/or System attribute(s) from the program
  group files by typing the command:

  attrib c:\windows\*.grp -r -h -s

  -or-

- From the File menu, choose Move. If the Move command is unavailable, open the
  PROGMAN.INI file in an ASCII text editor and locate the EditLevel= entry in
  the [Restrictions] section. If the entry is set to 2, 3, or 4, change it to 0
  (zero), which is the default value.


  -or-

- Decrease the active field area by opening the WIN.INI file in an ASCII text
  editor, locating the entries DoubleClickHeight= and DoubleClickWidth= in the
  [Windows] section, and reducing the values of either one or both these
  entries. Then restart Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The active field of an icon is the area in which Windows accepts a double- click
for execution. The WIN.INI file contains entries that determine this active
field size:

     [Windows]
     DoubleClickHeight=
     DoubleClickWidth=

An icon's active field is extended to the Height and Width values listed above in
pixels. These values make an icon active (that is, able to be executed when
highlighted) for that area. An icon cannot be moved initially within its active
field. The default value for these settings is 4. If the active field is larger
than the display resolution, Windows gives the appearance that the icons cannot
be moved at all. Decreasing the active field area enables the icons to be moved
again.

NOTE: If the program group icons cannot be moved from within Program Manager, the
EditLevel= value is set to 1 or above, or the active field is larger than the
distance being moved.
