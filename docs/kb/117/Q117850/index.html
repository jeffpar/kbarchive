The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following information is contained in the COUNTRY.TXT file included with
MS-DOS 6.22. The functionality of COUNTRY.SYS was enhanced in MS-DOS 6.22 by
adding keyboard support for Canada (standard CAN/CSA-Z keyboards), Brazil
(secondary standard keyboards), Bulgaria, Greece, Iceland, Macedonia and
Serbia/Montenegro, Romania, Russia, and Turkey.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Supplemental Information on MS-DOS 6.22--Customizing for International Use
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file provides information on customizing MS-DOS 6.22 for international
use. This information is not included in the MICROSOFT MS-DOS USER'S GUIDE,
MS-DOS Help or the README.TXT file. It supplements the international
keyboard and character set information provided in Section 1 of the
README.TXT file that accompanied MS-DOS 6.22.

This file covers the following topics:

 1. Additional Character Set (Codepage) and Keyboard Support
     1.1  The KEYBRD2.SYS File
     1.2  The EGA.CPI, EGA2.CPI, and EGA3.CPI Files
     1.3  Configuring Your Computer to Use International-Language Settings
 2. Switching Between Modes on Dual-Mode Keyboards
 3. Quick Reference Tables for International Language Support

1.  Additional Character Set (Codepage) and Keyboard Support
============================================================
MS-DOS 6.22 includes the KEYBRD2.SYS, EGA2.CPI and EGA3.CPI files, which
offer support for additional keyboards and character sets (codepages).
You use these files just as you would the KEYBOARD.SYS and EGA.CPI files.
MS-DOS also includes new country/region settings in COUNTRY.SYS.

MS-DOS 6.22 includes new country/region settings in COUNTRY.SYS that use
the new keyboards and character sets. For more information, see the tables
in section 4 of this file. For a complete list of all the
countries/regions, keyboards, and character sets provided by MS-DOS 6.22,
see section 4 of this file.

Note: ISO.CPI, an additional codepage information file, provides ISO-
compliant fonts that can be used in place of the standard MS-DOS fonts. The
ISO.CPI file is included in the MS-DOS Resource Kit; to obtain it, send in
the coupon in the back of your MS-DOS USER'S GUIDE.

1.1  The KEYBRD2.SYS File
-------------------------
The KEYBRD2.SYS file is essentially similar to KEYBOARD.SYS; you use it
just as you would the KEYBOARD.SYS file. The differences between
KEYBOARD.SYS and KEYBRD2.SYS are:

-  KEYBRD2.SYS contains support for the following keyboards, which
   are not supported by KEYBOARD.SYS:

   Country/region/Language             Keyboard layout   Keyboard ID
   -----------------------------------------------------------------
   Canada (standard CAN/CSA-Z keyboard)   cf      See below.
   Brazil (secondary standard keyboard)   br      274, 275
   Bulgaria                               bg      442
   Greece                                 gk      319
   Iceland                                is      161
   Macedonia and Serbia/Montenegro        yc      118
   Romania                                ro      333
   Russian                                ru      441
   Turkish                                tr      440, 179

-  Although KEYBRD2.SYS contains a Canadian keyboard with the same
   keyboard code (058) and identifier (cf) as KEYBOARD.SYS, the
   layout of the two keyboards is different. The Canadian keyboard
   layout in KEYBRD2.SYS meets the standard set forth by the Canadian
   government's specification 243.200-92 (CAN/CSA-Z). The keyboard
   layout in KEYBOARD.SYS is more commonly used, but does not meet
   Canadian government specifications.

-  The KEYBRD2.SYS file does not include support for the following
   keyboards supported by KEYBOARD.SYS:

      Belgium
      Danish
      French
      Japan
      Latin America
      Netherlands
      Portuguese
      Spanish
      Switzerland (German)
      Switzerland (French)

-  KEYBRD2.SYS contains changes to the German keyboard that are
   not in KEYBOARD.SYS. In the German keyboard, the SHIFT lock
   behavior of the top row of the keyboard is now functionally
   the same as the US keyboard (that is, "typewriter mode"
   has been removed).

1.2  The EGA.CPI, EGA2.CPI, and EGA3.CPI Files
----------------------------------------------
MS-DOS 6.22 includes three codepage information (.CPI) files, each
of which contains information for different code pages.

EGA.CPI contains the following:

   437 - United States
   850 - Multilingual (Latin I)
   852 - Slavic/Eastern European (Latin II)
   860 - Portuguese
   863 - Canadian-French
   865 - Nordic

EGA2.CPI contains the following:

   737 - Greek II
   850 - Multilingual (Latin I)
   852 - Slavic/Eastern European (Latin II)
   857 - Turkish
   861 - Icelandic
   869 - Greek

EGA3.CPI contains the following:

   437 - United States
   850 - Multilingual (Latin I)
   852 - Slavic/Eastern European (Latin II)
   855 - Cyrillic I
   866 - Russian (Cyrillic II)

1.3  Configuring Your Computer to Use International-Language Settings
---------------------------------------------------------------------
To use country/region settings or a character set other than the standard
ones (United States), you must edit your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
files.

For example, to use the new Icelandic settings, carry out the
following steps:

1. Add the following commands to your CONFIG.SYS file:

   REM  ICELAND SETTINGS
   COUNTRY=354,861,C:\DOS\COUNTRY.SYS
   DEVICE=C:\DOS\DISPLAY.SYS CON=(,,2)

2. Add the following commands to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

   REM  ICELAND SETTINGS
   MODE CON CP PREPARE=((861 850)C:\DOS\EGA2.CPI)
   MODE CON CP SELECT=861
   KEYB IS,,C:\DOS\KEYBRD2.SYS


3. Restart your computer.

2.  Switching Between Modes on Dual-Mode Keyboards
==================================================
MS-DOS 6.22 includes dual-mode keyboard support for Greek,
French Canadian, Bulgarian, Serbia/Montenegro, and Russian keyboards.
These keyboards allow you to easily switch between two different
keyboard modes. When your computer starts with one of these keyboards,
the primary mode is active. To switch modes, press the appropriate
key combination (listed below).

The key combinations for the Greek keyboard are as follows:

                   Mode description    Key combination
                   -----------------------------------
 Primary mode      Latin               ALT+LEFT SHIFT
 Secondary mode    Greek               ALT+RIGHT SHIFT

The key combinations for the French Canadian keyboard are as follows:

                   Mode description    Key combination
                   -----------------------------------
 Primary mode      Latin               CTRL+RIGHT SHIFT
 Secondary mode    Latin II            CTRL+LEFT SHIFT

The key combinations for the Bulgarian, Russian, Serbia/Montenegro and
Macedonia keyboards are as follows:

                   Mode description    Key combination
                   -----------------------------------
 Primary mode      Latin               ALT+LEFT SHIFT
 Secondary mode    Cyrillic            ALT+RIGHT SHIFT

4.  Quick Reference Tables for International Language Support
=============================================================
The following table lists each country/region supported by MS-DOS 6.22,
along with the associated character set, CPI file, and keyboard codes.

                                      Supported
                      Country/Region  Character           Keyboard K'board

*  Although COUNTRY.SYS supports the country/region conventions (date,
   time, currency, etc.) associated with code pages 862 (Hebrew), 864
   (Arabic), 932 (Japanese), 934 (Korean), 936 (PRC Chinese), and 938
   (Taiwanese), those character sets (code pages) are available only with
   the associated special versions of MS-DOS (Hebrew, Arabic, Japanese,
   Korean, PRC Chinese, and Taiwanese).

** Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, and Singapore have been added to
   COUNTRY.SYS to give access to these countries'/regions' settings when
   using Universal English.

If you need to use settings for one of these countries/regions using the
primary language for that country/region, contact the appropriate
International Microsoft Office (Microsoft Hong Kong Limited, Microsoft
Systems Private Limited (India), Microsoft Malaysia Sdn Bhd, or Microsoft
Singapore Pte Ltd).
