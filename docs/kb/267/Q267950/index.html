-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to your Exchange mailbox, you may receive a warning message
stating that you have exceeded your mailbox size limit. The following text is an
excerpt from the warning message:

  Your mailbox has exceeded one or more size limits set by your administrator.
  Your mailbox size is XXX KB.

Although the message text is localized, note that the text in the message is
different than the text for the client when connecting to the mailbox.

CAUSE
=====

The server creates store messages by using the language of the client that
accessed the mailbox for the last time. If you log on to your mailbox by using
an English-language version of the Outlook client, the store creates the next
warning message in the English language; if you log on to the same mailbox from
another client by using a German-language version of Outlook, the next store
warning message is created in the German language.

The language that is used to log on the mailbox for the first time after you
create the mailbox only determines the language of the standard folders (the
Inbox, Outbox, Tasks, and so on) and has no influence on the store messages.

In most cases, this problems is caused by third-party anti-virus software that
connect to single mailboxes by using a language version that is different than
the language of the client.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, log off of your mailbox, and then log on again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can determine the language of all connected clients by using the Exchange
Administrator program. To do this, expand your server object, click the private
information store, and then click Property. On the Logons tab, click Columns,
click the "locale ID", and then click Add.

You can see the locale IDs, for example:

  1033 - English (UK)
  1031 - German
  1038 - Hungarian
