The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

After you successfully complete a Systems Management Server (SMS) site setup,
the SMS Site Component Manager may not install the SMS_EXECUTIVE service. If
logging is enabled for the SMS Site Component Manager, the Sitecomp.log file may
log the following error message:

  Could not install the performance counters.

  $$&lt;SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER&gt;&lt;Mon Jul 03 12:25:46.750 2000 GMT Daylight Time&gt;&lt;thread=43 (0x2B)&gt;

  Installation failed and will be retried in the next polling cycle.

  $$&lt;SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER&gt;&lt;Mon Jul 03 12:25:46.750 2000 GMT Daylight Time&gt;&lt;thread=43

  (0x2B)&gt;

In some cases, the SMS Site Component Manager log may not show an error. However,
the SMS Site Component Manager stops running after approximately two minutes and
a CrashDump folder is created in the &lt;drive&gt;\SMS\Logs folder. The
Crash.log file in the CrashDump folder may report the following information:

  EXCEPTION INFORMATION

  Service name = SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER
  Thread name = SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER
  Executable = E:\SMS\bin\i386\sitecomp.exe

  STACK TRACE FOR SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER THREAD 221 (0xdd) AT 10/19/2000

  ==========================================================
  baseobj.dll   1428b985  0004b985 
  RemoveBrokenPerfCounterStringsFromRegistry() + 949 bytes

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the Perfc009.dat and Perfh009.dat files that are located
in the \Winnt\System32 folder have been corrupted or are missing. If these files
are not available, the following registry setting may be deleted or disabled
(grayed-out):

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Perflib\009

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q288239 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this issue, modify the Perflib registry key.

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry. Before
you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if a problem
occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring the Registry"
Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key" Help topic in
Regedt32.exe.

The following steps can be used to correct the Perflib key.

Note: These steps would wipe out all performance counters, and enable only the NT
counters that are installed with the operating system.

1. Stop the Site component Manager.

2. Expand perfc009.da_ and perfh.009.da_ from an NT4 Server source to
  \winnt\system32 as perfc009.dat and perfh009.dat respectively

You can expand these files from a command prompt by typing either

"expand perfc009.da_ perfc009.dat " (without the quotation marks)

-or-

"expand perfh009.da_ perfh009.dat" (without the quotation marks)

3. In "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\Perflib",
  set the value of Last Counter to 0x736 and Last Help to 0x737

4. The Perflib\009 key should now be re-populated. Run performance monitor and
  verify that NT counters are available.

5. Restart the SMS Site Component Manager. It should successfully re-install the
  SMS Executive.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 3.
