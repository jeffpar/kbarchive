SYMPTOMS
========

Fragments of a .asp, Global.asa, or other files may be retrieved from a Web
server when the URL is changed in a specific manner.

CAUSE
=====

This issue is a variant of the vulnerability that was originally discussed in
the following security bulletin and Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS00-031)
  (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms00-031.asp)

  Q260069 Malformed HTR Request Returns Source Code for ASP Scripting Files

This new issue is simply an additional way to exploit the same vulnerability.

Because of this vulnerability, a malicious user may be able to request files from
the server, which are then processed as though they were .htr files. This can
result in parts of the .asp or other file's source code being sent to the
malicious user.

NOTE: In theory, this vulnerability can expose sensitive data contained in the
.asp files. However, in practice, it's unlikely that this would occur. The HTR
processing tends to remove the very content that would be of interest to the
malicious user.


Disable HTR Functionality:

If you do not have business-critical .htr scripts, perform the following steps to
disable the .htr functionality:

1. Open the Internet Services Manager.

2. Right-click the Web server, click Properties, click Master Properties, and
  then click WWW Service.

3. Click Edit, click Home Directory, and then click Configuration.

4. Remove the .htr entry.

Apply the Patch:

For customers with business-critical HTR scripts who need to retain .htr
functionality and therefore can't disable .htr functionality, the following
patch is available that corrects these issues.

For Windows 2000
----------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows 2000. For

  Browsing

  Q260069 Malformed HTR Request Returns Source Code for ASP Scripting Files

What does this vulnerability allow a malicious user to do? :

Microsoft Security Bulletin MS00-031 provides the best description of the
vulnerability and the risk it poses. However, in a nutshell, the vulnerability
can allow a malicious user to request files from the server, which would then be
processed as though they were .htr files. The result of this can be that parts
of the ASP source code are sent to the malicious user.

Which parts of the .asp source code are likely to be sent?:

The ISAPI filter attempts to interpret the requested file as a .htr file, which
has the effect of removing virtually everything but the text from a selected
file. That is, it strips out the very information that is most likely to contain
sensitive information in .asp and other server-side files. For example, if this
vulnerability is used to try to read a file with the following contents:

  &lt;b&gt;Some HTML text&lt;/b&gt; 
  &lt;% 
  /*Some &lt;file://Some/&gt; ASP/HTR code*/ 
  var objConn = new ActiveXObject("Foo.bar"); 
  %&gt; 
  &lt;I&gt;other html code&lt;/I&gt; 
  other code.

The information that is returned to the malicious user is:

  &lt;b&gt;Some HTML text&lt;/b&gt; 
  &lt;I&gt;other html code&lt;/I&gt; 
  other code.

Related Security Bulletin:

For more information, please see the Microsoft Security Bulletin at
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/ms00-044.asp

What is HTR?:

HTR is a first-generation advanced scripting technology that is included in IIS
3.0, and still supported by later versions of IIS for backwards compatibility.
However, HTR was never widely adopted, and was superceded by Active Server Pages
(ASP) technology introduced in IIS 4.0.
