-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running Exchange Server 5.0, the directory service may stop
responding, with the following events recorded in the application log of Event
Viewer:

  Event ID: 32
  Source: EDB
  MSExchangeDS 145
  Unable to create the log. Error -1032.

  Event ID: 1171
  Source: MSExchangeDS
  Description: Exception E0010004 has occurred with parameters -510 and Zero.
  Internal ID of 2080112.

When you check the size of the Directory database (Dir.edb), you may find that
the size of the file is greatly reduced.

When you attempt to restart the directory service by restarting the Exchange
Server computer, the directory service may not start and the following event
appears in the application log of Event Viewer:

  Event ID: 1002
  Source: MSExchangeDS
  Description: The microsoft exchange server database (EDB) could not be
  initialized and returned error -1022. The directory cannot continue.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the Dir.edb file structure is damaged.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, restore the Dir.edb file from a tape backup.

If you do not have a valid backup copy of the Dir.edb file, you can restore the
file through full disaster recovery of Exchange Server.
