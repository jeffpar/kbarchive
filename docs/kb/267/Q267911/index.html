-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to access a mailbox in Exchange 2000 Server by using Outlook
Web Access (OWA) with Internet Explorer 5.0 or later on Microsoft Windows 2000,
the top pane and the left pane are displayed correctly, but the following error
message is displayed in the right pane:

  Loading...

  Unable to display folder. An internal server error occurred.

When you access OWA from a client computer that is not running Windows 2000, or
from a client computer that is on the same Local Area Network (LAN) as the
server that is running Exchange 2000, the text in the panes is displayed
correctly.

CAUSE
=====

When Windows Integrated authentication is enabled on the virtual directories for
Exchange 2000 content, Kerberos requires that the client and server times are
within 5 minutes (MaxClockSkew=5 minutes). This setting is based on the
Universal Time Coordinate (UTC). When this setting is used, different time zones
are accounted for.

Computers that are running on a LAN often do not experience this issue because
Windows Time Service is synchronized with the domain controller time. Windows
Time Service is controlled by using the net time command. When you join a
domain, Windows Time Service is enabled, and it automatically starts when the
computer starts.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, synchronize the time on the client computer with the
domain controller of the Exchange 2000 domain so that they are within five
minutes of each other.

Restart Windows Time Service on the client computer for the changes to the
system's date and time to take effect.

WORKAROUND
==========

When you receive this error message, click any folder in the Folder list view in
the left pane to view the contents. However, when you click Refresh on your
browser, the error message may still be displayed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The net time command can be used to synchronize a client computer with a time
server. An example of a command that you can use is:

  net time \\&lt;servername&gt; /set /y

For more information about the net time command, run the following command: net
time /?
