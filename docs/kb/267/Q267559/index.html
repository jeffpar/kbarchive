SYMPTOMS
========

NOTE: The issues described in this article are most likely to occur only on
computers that have been upgraded from IIS 3.0 (that included .htr-based
administrative tools) to IIS 4.0 or 5.0.

One of the following symptoms may occur when a GET is performed on a .htr file.

Symptom 1 - Denial of Service:

Performing a GET with a missing parameter on an existing .htr file can cause the
execution of an endless loop, resulting in 100 percent CPU usage, and in turn, a
denial of service to clients of the IIS server.

Symptom 2 - Ability to Browse Directories:

Performing a GET with a missing parameter for a .htr file that exists can give a
Web site visitor the ability to browse the Web site's directories.

NOTE: Only read-only browsing occurs in this situation. No files can be modified
by the Web site visitor.

CAUSE
=====

Cause of Symptom 1: Denial of Service:

The .htr file that received the GET does not correctly handle the case where an
expected parameter is missing. The absence of the parameter causes the script to
go into an endless loop, at which point the script consumes all CPU resources on
the server.

NOTE: An administrative script, implemented as a .htr file and installed as part
of IIS 3.0 and preserved on upgrade to IIS 4.0 or IIS 5.0 has this behavior of
does not correctly handle a missing parameter

Cause of Symptom 2: Ability to Browse Directories:

In addition, the permissions on the administrative script (and several related
ones), as well as potential .htr scripts created by the IIS user that were
appropriate under IIS 3.0 are inappropriate under IIS 4.0 and 5.0. This may
allow Web site visitors to use these tools, which provide the ability to view
the directory structure on the server.

Why do the tools have incorrect permissions? :

In IIS 3.0, HTR scripts can only be executed locally (that is, from the server
itself). Because only an administrator should be able to log onto a Web server
locally, it wasn't necessary for the scripts to authenticate the user, and it
wasn't necessary to restrict who could execute them.

However, IIS 4.0 introduced the capability for HTR scripts to be called remotely.
The combination of these two factors (loose permissions inherited from IIS 3.0,
coupled with the ability under IIS 4.0 to remotely execute HTR scripts) results
in the incorrect permissions.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows 2000. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q260910 How to Obtain the Latest Windows 2000 Service Pack

Resolution for Both Symptoms:

If you do not have business-critical .htr scripts, perform the following to
disable .htr functionality:

1. Open the Internet Services Manager.

2. Right-click the Web server, click Properties, click Master Properties, and
  then click WWW Service.

3. Click Edit, click Home Directory, and then click Configuration.

4. Remove the .htr entry

Resolution for  Symptom 2: Ability to Browse Directories:

Delete the /Scripts/Iisadmin directory, which contains the administrative scripts
used by IIS 3.0.

Alternatively, if you need to preserve this directory for some reason, make sure
to explicitly limit the access permissions to the proper user accounts.

Resolution for Symptom 1: Denial of Service:

For customers with business-critical HTR scripts who need to retain .htr
functionality and therefore can't disable .htr functionality, the following
patch is available that corrects the Denial of Service issue described in
Symptom 1.
