SUMMARY
=======

If you use the DR-DOS 6.0 DELWATCH delete-tracking utility on a floppy disk, you
should also use the DELPURGE utility on that disk before using it on an MS-DOS
systems.

If you haven't used DELWATCH on a floppy disk, exchanging it between DR-DOS 6.0
and MS-DOS is accomplished much as you would change a disk from MS-DOS 5.0 and
later to another version of MS-DOS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DR-DOS 6.0 DELWATCH utility changes how DR-DOS implements deletions.
Normally under MS-DOS (and non-DELWATCH) DR-DOS, a file is deleted by marking
the first character of a file with an "E5" character and marking the area of the
disk where the file was stored as "unused" in the file allocation table (FAT).
DELWATCH marks the file as "pending delete" by changing the first character of
the file to an "05" character. These files are not actually deleted until the
DELPURGE utility is used.

"Pending delete" files can cause confusion to MS-DOS and its utilities (such as
CHKDSK and UNDELETE) as well as third-party disk utility programs. You can
determine if you have "pending delete" files using the DR-DOS 6.0 CHKDSK
utility.

If "pending delete" files exist, use DELPURGE to delete them from your floppy
disk before using it on an MS-DOS systems.

DR-DOS is manufactured by Novell, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
