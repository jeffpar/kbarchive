TIMERS AND THEIR USES
---------------------

Microsoft Windows timers create an event that periodically triggers a specific
action in an application. The event can be a WM_TIMER message returned from a
GetMessage or a PeekMessage function, or it can be a call to a specified
function.

Timers are used in many ways. For example, the Windows Clock application uses a
timer to awaken the application periodically to update the clock face.
Internally, carets flash on timer events. Also, the rate at which list boxes and
edit controls scroll is based on timer events. Without timers, the application
would remain active in delay loops, violating the "give up control when you are
not active" rule needed to keep the nonpreemptive tasking model of Windows
running.

Instead, a Windows-based application creates a timer with an appropriate delay
and then suspends itself in a standard GetMessage loop. When the timer delay
expires, the timer event is generated, and the application can perform the
necessary operation. At this point the timer can either be destroyed or be left
active. If it is left active, another timer event is generated when the timer
delay again expires. This cycle continues until the timer is destroyed. Windows
version 3.0 can maintain only 16 active timers; Windows version 3.1 can maintain
only 32 active timers. Therefore, an application that is not actively using a
timer should destroy it so the timer can be used by another application.

Tip: Timers are a limited resource. If all timers are in use, the SetTimer
function fails. Unless keeping a timer active is absolutely essential to a
program, the application must destroy the timer when it is not in use.

Creating and Destroying a Timer
-------------------------------

A timer is created when a program calls the SetTimer function. A timer can
dispatch a message to a particular window or call a specified callback function.
The lpTimerFunc parameter to SetTimer determines whether a message is sent or a
callback function is called. When GetMessage and PeekMessage determine that a
timer event has occurred, they return a WM_TIMER message. The lParam of this
message contains the lpTimerFunc value passed to SetTimer. The code in
DispatchMessage examines the lParam of the WM_TIMER message and dispatches the
message to the appropriate window procedure if the lParam is NULL, or calls the
callback if the lParam is not NULL. If the lpTimerFunc parameter contains a
non-null value, it is assumed to be the FARPROC address of an exported callback
function (use MakeProcInstance on it too). This parameter must be correct
because Windows does not validate it. Windows simply makes a far call to the
specified address. The format of the callback is described in the Microsoft
Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) documentation for the SetTimer function,
but the following table better describes the parameters to the callback.

  Parameter Description
  --------- -----------

  hWnd      The window handle that was passed as the hWnd parameter to
            the SetTimer function. Because Windows never looks at this
            parameter, you can pass a NULL here if the callback doesn't
            need an hWnd or if no hWnd is available at the time SetTimer
            is called.

  wMsg      Always WM_TIMER.

  nIDEvent  The timer's ID.

  dwTimer   DispatchMessage calls the GetTickCount function and then
            passes the value obtained in dwTimer.

If the lpTimerFunc parameter to SetTimer is NULL, the timer generates a WM_TIMER
message for the window specified by the hWnd parameter. The lParam of the
WM_TIMER message returned from GetMessage or PeekMessage is NULL, which causes
DispatchMessage to send the message to the appropriate Windows procedure. If
hWnd is not a valid window handle, DispatchMessage returns an "Invalid Window
Handle" FatalExit (code 0x0007). When the window procedure gets the WM_TIMER
message, the wParam contains the timer's ID, and the lParam is NULL.

When a timer is created, it is assigned an ID. Timer IDs are passed to timer
callback functions and with WM_TIMER messages. Timer IDs are also used when
killing the timer with the KillTimer function. The nIDEvent parameter lets an
application choose the timer's ID if the hWnd parameter is not NULL. If the hWnd
parameter is NULL, Windows chooses an ID and returns it from the SetTimer
function. In this case, the nIDEvent parameter is ignored, regardless of the
value of lpTimerFunc.

The return value from SetTimer is 0 (zero) if the timer could not be created.
This situation occurs only when all timers are in use before the function is
called. SetTimer returns a nonzero value if the timer is successfully created.
If the hWnd parameter is NULL, this nonzero value is the timer's ID. If hWnd is
nonzero, the function succeeded, and the timer's ID is the value passed in
nIDEvent. The timer's ID must be saved because it will be needed later to kill
the timer.

Tip: If the application calls SetTimer with a nonzero hWnd, it must specify the
timer ID. Contrary to the Windows version 3.0 documentation, this ID, not the
SetTimer return value, must be used when killing the timer.

If SetTimer is called with exactly the same hWnd and ID as an already active
timer, Windows resets the timer rate to the new value passed in the wElapse
parameter. This method is convenient for changing the rate of a timer without
having to kill it and create a new one. Note that if hWnd is NULL, the ID value
passed must be the timer's ID as returned from the preceding SetTimer call.

In all flavors of SetTimer, the timer event rate is passed in the wElapse
parameter. It is specified in milliseconds but is not nearly that precise.

A timer is killed by calling the KillTimer function. KillTimer requires two
parameters: the hWnd that was passed to SetTimer when the timer was created and
the timer's ID. Note again that if hWnd is NULL, the timer's ID is the return
value from the SetTimer call, not the value passed in the nIDEvent parameter.

Timer Implementation and the Effect on Timer Resolution
-------------------------------------------------------

All ISA (IBM PC/AT and compatible) computer systems generate a hardware interrupt
on IRQ0 18.2 Hz. This interrupt is mapped to INT 8 and can be intercepted by any
application that wants to hook it. At 18.2 Hz, the interrupt occurs
approximately once every 55 milliseconds. The Windows system driver hooks INT 8
and maintains the value returned by the GetTickCount function. Thus, this value
is accurate only to within 55 milliseconds.

Interrupt-level timer services via INT 8 are fairly straightforward and easy to
understand. Providing timer services to a Windows-based application is much more
difficult. The two major complications are the inability to call Windows-based
applications at interrupt level and the nonpreemptive nature of the Windows
tasking model. A timer event for a Windows-based application must behave the
same as other interrupt-driven events such as mouse and keyboard events: The
event must be detected and recorded at interrupt level but dispatched only to
the appropriate application the next time the application asks for messages.
Therefore, the delay between the interrupt event occurring and the application
receiving it is nondeterministic.

Although the hardware timer rate is 18.2 Hz, the rate at which Windows-based
applications receive timer messages is quite a bit slower and is affected by
other applications that are running.

Windows hooks INT 8 at initialization time. As a timer is created, a timer data
structure is reserved for the timer. This data structure contains information
about the timer, such as which hWnd to send the message to or which FARPROC to
call, the timer ID, or the delay time between events. This delay time is then
copied into a current delay counter. When the INT 8 handler is called, the
current delay counter for each active timer is decremented by 55 (because the
delay time is specified in milliseconds). If in doing so the current delay
counter reaches 0, a flag is set to indicate that an event should be generated
for this timer.

GetMessage and PeekMessage first check to see if any posted messages or any
keyboard or mouse events are waiting for the application. If none are,
GetMessage and PeekMessage check to see if any timers created by the active
application have triggered. If one of these timers has triggered, GetMessage and
PeekMessage create a WM_TIMER message with the appropriate wParam and lParam and
return the message. Contrary to the SDK documentation, the message is never
placed in the applications queue. DispatchMessage properly dispatches the
message either to the appropriate window or to the specified callback function.

When a timer is created, it is associated with the currently active task. When
GetMessage and PeekMessage scan for timer events, they look only at timers
associated with the currently active task. Although not normally a problem, this
activity does prevent an application from creating a timer that would dispatch
WM_TIMER messages to a window in another task. Also, timers should not be
created in systemwide hooks such as the keyboard hook because the hook is likely
to be called while another task is active.

Tip: Be careful with SetTimer calls inside dynamic-link libraries (DLLs). If a
DLL creates a timer on behalf of a task and then the task terminates, the timer
is destroyed.

ENHANCED-MODE VIRTUALIZATION
----------------------------

When running in enhanced mode, Windows takes advantage of the virtual machine
(VM) capabilities of the Intel386(TM) hardware. All MS-DOS-based applications
run as if each had the entire system to itself. All Windows-based applications
run together in a single VM. All VMs, if none are paged, reside simultaneously
in physical memory, but only one at a time is active. To arbitrate among the
VMs, Windows loads a virtualization layer when running in enhanced mode. This
layer acts as a traffic cop, directing hardware events to the appropriate VM on
the basis of which VM is active.

One of the many hardware events that is virtualized is INT 8, the timer. When a
VM is not the active VM, it does not receive INT 8 events at the standard 18.2
Hz rate. The Windows VM not receiving INT 8 events at a standard rate plays
havoc with the value returned by the GetTickCount function as well as with any
active timers set by Windows- based applications. In this environment, WM_TIMER
messages are at the mercy of the enhanced-mode scheduler and the relative
priority of the Windows VM. Probably more problematic is the value returned from
GetTickCount. Because this value increments by 55 only when the Windows VM sees
an INT 8, it is not at all accurate in enhanced mode. Applications that require
accurate event timing must not use GetTickCount to determine time delays.
Instead, they must use the clock maintained by MS-DOS (INT 21H, function 2CH),
TOOLHELP.DLL services, or the VTD (described below).

Tip: Windows timers operate erratically in enhanced mode when MS-DOS-based
applications are active.

Tip: The GetTickCount function cannot be used to time events accurately because
it is not regularly updated when the MS-DOS VMs are active. GetTickCount is
inaccurate both in standard mode and in enhanced mode.

STANDARD-MODE TASK SWITCHING
----------------------------

Standard-mode task switching has essentially the same effect on the GetTickCount
value and Windows timers as does enhanced-mode virtualization, but for a
different reason. When a task is switched in standard mode, either between an
MS-DOS-based application and Windows or between two MS-DOS-based applications,
Windows swaps the entire running application to disk and then loads the new
application from its previously saved swap file. While running an MS-DOS-based
application, the Windows INT 8 handler obviously is not being called because
Windows is not in memory. Thus, any active timers do not count down, and the
GetTickCount value does not increment. This problem is less obvious in standard
mode than in enhanced mode because MS-DOS-based applications cannot run in a
window in standard mode.

USING TOOLHELP.DLL
------------------

TOOLHELP.DLL is a new library being developed for Windows version 3.1, but it
will also run under Windows version 3.0. It was developed for use by debuggers
and profilers, but its ability to provide high- resolution timing services is
useful to other types of Windows-based applications. The TimerCount function can
return system time information that is accurate to the millisecond. The function
returns two values: a count of how long Windows has been running and a
cumulative total of how long the Windows VM has been active. In standard mode,
both values are the same and contain the time Windows has been running; however,
the counts are accurate only if no task switches take place, because they are
not maintained while MS-DOS-based applications are active.

VIRTUAL TIMER DEVICE
--------------------

The virtual timer device (VTD) provides timer services that are more accurate
than the value returned by GetTickCount. TOOLHELP.DLL provides a convenient way
to access the VTD services via the TimerCount function. Under some conditions,
however, calling TimerCount is not possible or appropriate. Under these rare
conditions, an application can call the VTD directly. The VTD in Windows version
3.1 is the first version of the VTD that supplies these timer services.

The VTD uses the 8253 Programmable Interval Timer chip to obtain its values. The
8253 countdown register is always set to FFFFh, and the rate is set to 1.196
MHz. Thus, an interrupt is generated about 18.2 times per second, or roughly
every 55 milliseconds. This is the interrupt that comes through INT 8. The
countdown register of the 8253 is accessible at any time, and the VTD uses it to
obtain more accurate time information than is available through INT 8.

The address of the function in the VTD that provides these timer services is
obtained in a slightly roundabout way. The application must execute an INT 2Fh
instruction with the AX register set to 1684h and the BX register set to 5. This
instruction returns the address of the VTD timer services function in ES:DI.

The following values can be obtained from the VTD by calling this function with
the appropriate value in the AX register.

Version Number
--------------

The VTD version number is obtained by calling the VTD with AX set to 0. The major
version number is returned in AH, and the minor version number is returned in
AL. The version number does not change to match the version of Windows with
which the VTD is shipped. Instead, the version number changes when any
modifications or additions are made to the services provided. The version values
returned from the VTD in Windows version 3.1 are AH set to 3 and AL set to 0Ah.

Current Clock Tick Time
-----------------------

The VTD maintains a 64-bit value that is accurate to 0.8 microseconds. This value
is obtained by calling the VTD with AX set to 0100h. The 64-bit value is
returned in EDX:EAX. The returned value indicates the time Windows has been
running based on a 1.196 MHz clock.

Current System Time in Milliseconds
-----------------------------------

The VTD also maintains the time in milliseconds Windows has been running. This
value can be obtained by calling the VTD with AX set to 0101h. The 32-bit result
is returned in the EAX register. This value is not affected by changes in VM
activation.

Current VM Time in Milliseconds
-------------------------------

The cumulative time the current VM has been active can be obtained by calling the
VTD with AX set to 0102h. The 32-bit result is returned in the EAX register. The
value returned is the cumulative amount of time that the VM that is active at
the time of the call has been active.

All applications will incur an overhead when calling the VTD (also when calling
TOOLHELP.DLL because it, in turn, calls the VTD). Calling the VTD causes a ring
transition because the VTD runs in ring 0. Ring transitions are about 100 times
slower than a far call but still take less than 1 millisecond. The overhead for
a ring transition to the VTD is constant.
