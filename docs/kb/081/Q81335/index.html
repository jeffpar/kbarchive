SUMMARY
=======

A dynamic-link library (DLL) in the Windows environment has a single data
segment that is used by each task (application instance) that links to the DLL.
However, there are many situations in which a DLL must maintain data for each
individual task. This article discusses the method used by the MULTINST sample
application to create a multiple instance DLL. The DLL creates a separate data
segment for each task that links to it.

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of

servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.


Because each task in the system has a separate stack segment, the value of the
stack segment can be used as a unique identifier. MULTINST stores data for each
task in a block of memory obtained using GlobalAlloc(). Each time a task calls
the DLL, use the value of its stack segment as an index into the table of
selectors for the global memory blocks. Load the corresponding selector into the
DS register. After this is done, all static data and the local heap correspond
to the calling task.

When a new task calls into the DLL for the first time, the DLL allocates a new
block of memory to hold data for the task. It copies initial values for static
variables into the data block, and initializes a local heap.

When a task that uses the DLL shuts down, it calls the UnregisterTask() function
in the DLL, which frees the data block associated with the task and removes the
task from the DLL's task list. Failing to call UnregisterTask() might cause
serious problems because Windows could reassign a stack segment value to a new
task. If this task called the DLL, it would receive the data values associated
with the previous task, which might be completely inappropriate.

Place the following six lines of code at the beginning of each function exported
by the DLL to load the correct data segment:

     if ((wDS = LoadInstanceData()) == 0) // Get DS for this instance
        return;                           // If DS==0 then out of memory

     _asm {
          mov     ax,wDS
          mov     DS,ax
          }

The following text describes each function in the MULTINST DLL:

AddTask(): Allocate data for the task, initialize the data, and add the
          task to the task list.

FillHeap(): Allocate memory in the local heap until LocalAlloc fails.
           Used to demonstrate that the local heap will grow.

InitInstanceData(): Save initial values of static variables and
                   initialize the task list.

LibMain(): Save the initial values of static variables and the initial
          size of the data segment and the heap.

LoadInstanceData(): Retrieve the segment address (selector) to the data
                   for the task that called the DLL.

LookUpTask(): Given the value of the stack segment for the task, look up
             the segment address (selector) for the data for the task.
             If the task is not in the list, this function returns zero.

StoreData(): Save a string in the local heap.

WEP(): Required by a DLL.
