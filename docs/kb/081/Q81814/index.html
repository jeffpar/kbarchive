SUMMARY
=======

ToolBox.exe is a file in the Microsoft Download Center that demonstrates how to
implement a tool box window in an application. The Image Editor and the Dialog
Editor are two applications provided with the Windows SDK that demonstrate a
"tool box" window.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  ToolBox.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/platformsdk/sample76/3.1/W31/EN-US/ToolBox.exe)

A tool box window contains a group of icons that the user can choose at any time.
The tool box window always floats above the application with which it is
associated.

The code in TOOLBOX assumes that all buttons in the tool box have the same size
and are equally spaced throughout the window. TOOLBOX implements the following
four steps to create the tool box window:

1. Loads the bitmap that provides the visual appearance for all the buttons.

2. Creates the tool box window with the WS_EX_TOPMOST style bit set. Sizes the
  window appropriately based on the size of the bitmap.

3. Processes the WM_ACTIVATE message in the window procedure for the
  application's main window. If the main window or the tool box window is being
  activated, TOOLBOX calls SetWindowPos() to add the WS_EX_TOPMOST style to the
  window. If a window other than the main window or the tool box window is
  being activated, TOOLBOX calls SetWindowPos() to remove the WS_EX_TOPMOST
  style from the window.

4. Performs the following two steps in the window procedure for the tool box
  window:

  a. Processes the WM_LBUTTONDOWN message. Performs hit testing to determine
     which button the user chose. To make the button appear depressed, TOOLBOX
     determines the rectangle for the button. TOOLBOX uses the InvertRect
     function to invert the colors of the button.

  b. Processes the WM_PAINT message. TOOLBOX uses the StretchBlt() function to
     paint the bitmap onto the window. If any button is depressed, TOOLBOX
     inverts the appropriate region as above.

Although this sample does not demonstrate every possibility for tool box windows,
the sample is very straightforward and easily modified.
