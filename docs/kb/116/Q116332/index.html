SYMPTOMS
========

Using SQL Server ODBC driver and SQL Server and if ODBC prepared execution is
used, certain floating point values may be incorrectly converted. NOTE:
Microsoft Access and Microsoft Visual Basic commonly use the ODBC prepared
execution.

For example, consider a SQL Server table with a float column. When an ODBC
application successfully executes an insert into that table with the float
column value = 2.9 using prepared execution. However, when a query to get the
rows with the float values equal to 2.9 is executed, no rows are returned from
SQL Server. The following query is an example:

     CREATE TABLE  test(col1 float)

     INSERT into test VALUES(2.9)

     SELECT col1 FROM test WHERE col1=2.9

However, the following query shows the row with col1=2.9

  SELECT * FROM test

This does not happen when the insert is done from a DB-Library (DB-Lib) client
tool, or if direct, non-prepared execution is used. For the SQL Server driver,
if the users do not have CREATE PROC permission, direct, non-prepared execution
is used.

In case of Microsoft Access and Visual Basic, the behavior is exhibited by doing
the insert into either an attached table or by creating the dynaset, followed by
running the query to retrieve the records where float column equals the value
inserted.

For example,

     Dim db As Database
     Dim ds As Dynaset

     Set ds = db.CreateDynaset("SELECT * FROM test")
     ds.AddNew
     ds.Fields("col1") = 2.9
     ds.Update

Then a query which checks for equality of the float column to the value inserted
does not show the record inserted above, whereas a non-qualified query shows the
record. For example, the recordset for the ds1 dynaset does not show the record
inserted, whereas ds2 dynaset will.

     Set ds1 = db.CreateDynaset("SELECT * FROM test WHERE col1=2.9")

     Set ds2 = db.CreateDynaset("SELECT * FROM test")

For an ODBC application writer, the following steps will produce the behavior:

     //Prepared execution to update the table
     SQLPrepare: INSERT INTO test VALUES (?)

     //Set parameters for the above prepared stmt
     SQLSetParam:

     //Execute the previously prepared stmt
     //and verify that it returned SQL_SUCCESS
     SQLExecute:

     //Execute the following query
     SQLExecDirect: SELECT * FROM test WHERE col1=2.9

And then retrieve the result to see that the record inserted above does not show
up. However, executing the following shows the record inserted above:

     //Execute the following query
     SQLExecDirect: SELECT * FROM test

CAUSE
=====

The difference in behavior is because in the case of prepared execution, the
ODBC driver is doing the conversion to float; whereas in the case of
non-prepared execution and DB-Lib client tools, SQL Server is doing the
conversion.

WORKAROUND
==========

To workaround this problem, you can do an explicit convert on the SQL Server
using a statement similar to the following:

  UPDATE test SET f= (CONVERT(FLOAT, CONVERT(VARCHAR, col1)))

You can also do the same thing within a trigger to automatically update the value
for all new records inserted.

Please note that this problem does not occur using pass-through mechanism since
in that case, the conversion is done by SQL Server.
