1. SETUP
========

1.1 SpeedStor
-------------
If Setup referred you to this section and your computer has an OS/2
partition created by using the FDISKPM utility in OS/2 2.1, run
MS-DOS Setup by typing SETUP /U at the command prompt.

If Setup referred you to this section and you have neither OS/2
nor a SpeedStor partition on your computer, see the section "Setup
displays the Incompatible Hard Disk or Device Driver screen" in
the "Diagnosing and Solving Problems" chapter of the MS-DOS
User's Guide.

If you do have a SpeedStor partition on your computer, Setup
probably referred you to this section for one of the following
reasons:

* Setup could not find in your CONFIG.SYS file a command
 for the device driver that supports your SpeedStor partition.
 If this is the case, add the command line to your CONFIG.SYS
 file, restart your computer, and run Setup. For more information
 about adding the command line to your CONFIG.SYS file, see your
 SpeedStor documentation.

* Your CONFIG.SYS file has a DEVICE=HARDRIVE.SYS line in it.
 If this is the case, carry out the following procedure:

  1. Use the EXPAND command to expand and copy the SSTOR.SYS
     file to your hard disk. Make sure you copy the SSTOR.SYS
     file to the same path as the HARDRIVE.SYS file.

     See the PACKING.LST file on Setup Disk 1 for the location
     of the SSTOR.SYS file on the Setup disks and for instructions
     on how to expand and copy it to your hard disk.

  2. Replace the DEVICE=HARDRIVE.SYS command with a DEVICE=SSTOR.SYS
     command. For example, if the command that loaded the
     HARDRIVE.SYS file was DEVICE=C:\SSTOR\HARDRIVE.SYS, you
     would replace it with DEVICE=C:\SSTOR\SSTOR.SYS.

  3. Restart your computer.

  4. Make sure you can access your hard disk.

  5. Run Setup.

1.2 Incompatible Hard Disk or Device Driver
-------------------------------------------
If Setup referred you to this section, and no other section in this
file is relevant to your system, you have a partition that is
incompatible with MS-DOS 6.22. You must delete the partition from your
hard disk. See "Using Fdisk to Configure Your Hard Disk" in the
chapter "Diagnosing and Solving Problems" in the MICROSOFT MS-DOS
USER'S GUIDE.

1.3 AT&amp;T 6300 Computer
----------------------
If you use an AT&amp;T 6300 computer and your ROM BIOS is version 1.21,
contact your vendor for a ROM BIOS upgrade. The ROM BIOS version
number is displayed when you start your computer.

1.4 Toshiba with a Hard RAM Disk
--------------------------------
These instructions apply to Toshiba models T1200, T1600,
T1200XE and T1000LE.

To use the hard RAM disk, carry out the following procedure
before you install MS-DOS 6.22:

1. Back up your hard RAM disk.

2. Using the Toshiba Setup program, delete the hard RAM
  disk by allocating zero kilobytes (KB) to it. All data on
  the hard RAM disk will be lost.

3. Restart your computer

4. Run MS-DOS Setup.

5. After Setup is complete, run the Toshiba Setup program to reinstall
  the hard RAM disk.

6. Run FDISK, change to drive 2, and create a primary DOS
  partition. Quit FDISK.

7. Use the FORMAT command to format drive D.

1.5 Tandy with ROM DOS
----------------------
Contact your hardware manufacturer for information about
upgrading a Tandy computer with ROM DOS to MS-DOS 6.22. This
applies to the following models: 1000EX, 1000HX, 1000SL, 1000SL2,
1000TL, 1000TL2, 1000TL3, 1000RL, 1000RLX, 1000RL-HD, 1000RLX-HD,
1100FD, 2500XL, 2500XL2.

1.6 Setup displays the "Your computer uses a disk-compression
    program that is incompatible with Setup" message.
--------------------------------------------------------------
If Setup indicated that your computer has an incompatible
disk-compression program, you must remove it manually before you can
install MS-DOS 6.22. Contact your disk-compression vendor for an
updated version of your software. In most cases, current versions of
disk-compression software are compatible with MS-DOS 6.22.

Alternatively, you can use the procedure below to remove your
current disk-compression software.

1. Back up all the files on your compressed drive. In step 3,
  you will format your uncompressed drive, which destroys all the files
  on your compressed and uncompressed drives.

2. If your Setup disks are compatible with drive A, insert
  Setup Disk 1 in drive A, and restart your computer. After Setup
  displays the first screen, quit Setup by pressing F3 twice.

  If your Setup disks are not compatible with drive A,
  create a startup floppy disk for drive A. To do this, insert
  Setup Disk 1 in drive B, and a blank floppy disk in drive A. Then
  type B:SETUP /F at the command prompt.

  When prompted, choose to install MS-DOS on the floppy disk
  in drive A. After Setup is finished, leave the disk in drive A,
  and restart your computer.

3. At the command prompt, type FORMAT C: /S to reformat your startup
  drive and transfer MS-DOS 6.22 system files to it.

4. Remove the disk from drive A, and restart your computer.

5. Insert Setup Disk 1 in drive A or B, and type A:SETUP or
  B:SETUP at the command prompt.

6. After Setup is complete, restore the files you backed up. Do
  not restore older versions of MS-DOS files.

1.7 You deleted files from the directory that Setup needs
   to install the optional Windows programs.
---------------------------------------------------------
If you typed BUSETUP /E at the command prompt, the "Setup did
not find the files it needs in the directory specified" message
appeared, and you think you deleted the files from
your hard disk, insert Setup Disk 1 in drive A or B, and start
Setup by typing A:SETUP /E or B:SETUP /E at the command prompt.

1.8 Running Setup if Your Computer Uses Windows NT
--------------------------------------------------
If your computer has Windows NT installed, but does not have
MS-DOS installed on it, carry out Procedure 1. If your computer
has Windows NT and MS-DOS installed on it, carry out Procedure 2.

Procedure 1

1. Run Setup by inserting Setup Disk 1 in drive A and restarting
  your computer. Complete Setup by following the instructions
  on the screen. When Setup is complete, Windows NT will be
  disabled.

  If Windows NT was installed on a FAT partition, complete steps
  2 and 3 of this procedure to reenable Windows NT so that you can
  use both the Windows NT and MS-DOS operating systems.

  If Windows NT was installed on a non-FAT partition, see section 1.9.

2. Insert your Windows NT Setup disk in drive A or drive B, and then
  restart your computer.

3. When the Windows NT Setup screen appears, choose Repair, and then
  insert your Windows NT Emergency Repair Disk (which you created when
  you installed Windows NT) to repair the Windows NT system files.

Procedure 2

1. When you start your computer, choose MS-DOS as your operating
  system.

2. Run Setup by inserting Setup Disk 1 in drive A or B, and typing
  A:SETUP or B:SETUP at the command prompt.

1.9  Setup detects that your computer has a non-MS-DOS
    partition or non-MS-DOS files, and your computer uses
    Windows NT
----------------------------------------------------------
The procedure you use depends on whether you want to preserve
the partition and its files. Find the section below that describes
the configuration you want.

You Don't Want to Preserve the Partition or its Files
------------------------------------------------------
If you don't want to preserve the partition or its files, choose to
remove the partition or files if Setup prompts you to do so. If
Setup doesn't offer you that choice, remove the partition manually
after Setup is complete. For instructions on removing a non-MS-DOS
partition manually, see "Using Fdisk to Configure Your Hard Disk" in
the chapter "Diagnosing and Solving Problems" in the MICROSOFT MS-DOS
USER'S GUIDE.

You Don't Want to Preserve the Partition but Want to Save its Files
-------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to save the data files, but don't want to preserve the
partition, back up the files, run Setup again, and then choose to
remove the partition or files if Setup prompts you to do so. If Setup
doesn't offer you this choice, remove the partition manually after
Setup is complete. For instructions on removing the partition
manually, see "Using Fdisk to Configure Your Hard Disk" in the
chapter "Diagnosing and Solving Problems" in the MICROSOFT MS-DOS
USER'S GUIDE.

You Want to Preserve the Partition and Its Files
------------------------------------------------
Carry out the following procedure.

NOTE  If the non-MS-DOS partition takes up all the space on your hard
disk, you must reconfigure your hard disk. You can either let Setup do
it for you, as described in the preceding section, or reconfigure it
yourself manually. For instructions on reconfiguring your hard disk
manually, see your Windows NT documentation.

To install MS-DOS 6.22 and preserve your partition or files:

1. Run MS-DOS Setup.

2. When prompted, choose to continue Setup without removing the
  partition or files.

3. After Setup is complete, insert your Windows NT Setup disk
  in drive A or drive B, and then restart your computer.

4. When the Windows NT Setup screen appears, choose Repair, and then
  insert your Windows NT Emergency Repair Disk (which you created when
  you installed Windows NT) to repair the Windows NT system files.

1.10 Setup displays the "Your computer uses password protection"
    screen.
----------------------------------------------------------------
See section 1.12.

1.11 Setup displays the "Your computer is using an incompatible
    delete-protection program" screen.
---------------------------------------------------------------
See section 1.12.

1.12 Setup detects that your computer uses DR DOS.
--------------------------------------------------
If you have DR DOS installed on your computer, take the following
precautions before restarting Setup:

o If your system has any security features, including password protection,
 disable them. For more information, see "Setup displays the 'Your
 computer uses password protection' screen" in the chapter "Diagnosing
 and Solving Problems" in the MICROSOFT MS-DOS USER'S GUIDE.

 If you have protected any files or directories with a password,
 remove the password protection, particularly if you have protected
 your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT files, or your DR DOS directory.

o If you have DELWATCH installed on your computer, carry out
 the procedure "Setup displays the 'Your computer is using an
 incompatible delete-protection program' screen" in the chapter
 "Diagnosing and Solving Problems" in the MICROSOFT MS-DOS
 USER'S GUIDE.

o If your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT files use any conditional commands--
 such as the "?" or GOTO commands--remove them and adjust the order of
 commands in your startup files accordingly.

o If your CONFIG.SYS file uses the CHAIN command, remove it and
 adjust the order of commands in the file accordingly.

o If your computer uses disk compression, but drive C is not compressed,
 run Setup as described in the chapter "Getting Started" in the
 MICROSOFT MS-DOS USER'S GUIDE. When Setup displays the "Your
 CONFIG.SYS file contains commands that are not valid MS-DOS commands"
 message, choose the "Modify original files" option.

 If drive C is compressed, carry out the following procedure:

 1. Determine which drive is your original uncompressed drive. For more
    information, see your DR DOS documentation.

 2. Make backup copies of the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files on your
    compressed drive, and the DCONFIG.SYS file on your uncompressed drive.

 3. Combine the two configuration files. For example, if drive D is your
    uncompressed drive, type the following at the command prompt:

    COPY D:\DCONFIG.SYS+C:\CONFIG.SYS D:\CONFIG.SYS

 4. Copy the combined CONFIG.SYS file to drive C. For example, if drive
    D is your uncompressed drive, type the following at the command
    prompt:

    COPY D:\CONFIG.SYS C:\CONFIG.SYS

 5. Copy your AUTOEXEC.BAT to your uncompressed drive. For example, if
    drive D is your uncompressed drive, type the following at the
    command prompt:

    COPY C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT D:\AUTOEXEC.BAT

 6. Run MS-DOS 6.22 Setup.

 7. When Setup displays the "Your CONFIG.SYS file contains commands
    that are not valid MS-DOS commands" message, choose the "Modify
    original files" option.

    When Setup displays the "Because you are currently using the
    DR DOS operating system" message, choose Continue.

 8. After Setup is complete, MS-DOS displays an "Unrecognized command"
    message on your screen for each command in your AUTOEXEC.BAT and
    CONFIG.SYS files that is not a valid MS-DOS command. Remove these
    commands from your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.

 9. Add the DEVICE=HIMEM.SYS command to the beginning of your
    CONFIG.SYS file, and the restart your computer.

1.13 Installing MS-DOS on a Drive Other Than C
----------------------------------------------
As described in the following procedure, you can install MS-DOS
on a drive other than C by using the /M switch to copy the system
files to your startup drive and then using the /Q switch to copy your
MS-DOS files to a different drive.

NOTE  This procedure is designed for advanced users. If your computer
uses disk-compression software, modify the procedure as appropriate.

NOTE  If your computer uses disk-partitioning software, such as Disk
Manager, SpeedStor, Priam, or Everex, do not carry out the procedure until
you have carried out steps 1 through 3 of "You need to install MS-DOS
manually" in the chapter "Diagnosing and Solving Problems" in the
MICROSOFT MS-DOS USER'S GUIDE. If your software uses a driver to
enable the drive on which you want to install MS-DOS, make sure you create
a startup disk with the driver in a CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
After you have carried out these steps, skip to step 3 of the following
procedure.

1. Run Setup by inserting Setup Disk 1 in drive A or B, and
  typing A:SETUP /M or B:SETUP /M at the command prompt.

  NOTE  Your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files were saved as CONFIG.NEW
  and AUTOEXEC.NEW.

2. Run Setup by inserting Setup Disk 1 in drive A or B, and typing
  A:SETUP /Q or B:SETUP /Q at the command prompt. Follow the
  instructions on your screen.

3. When Setup displays the system settings screen, choose the MS-DOS
  Path option. Type the drive and directory where you want
  to install MS-DOS, and press ENTER. Continue Setup.

4. After Setup is complete, open your CONFIG.NEW and AUTOEXEC.NEW files
  and ensure that their commands specify the correct path. Save the files
  as CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT. Then restart your computer.

1.14 Bypassing the Uninstall Disk and Using Default Setup Options
-----------------------------------------------------------------
To keep Setup from creating an Uninstall Disk, use the /G switch
with the Setup command.

To bypass the Uninstall disk and use default Setup options
instead of choosing them yourself, use both the /H and /G switches
with the Setup command.

WARNING  The primary purpose of the Uninstall disk is to safeguard
your files during and after Setup. If Setup doesn't create
an Uninstall disk, you will not be able to restore your previous
version of DOS. If Setup should render your hard disk inaccessible,
you will not be able to use the Uninstall disk to make it accessible
again.

IMPORTANT  If you have not created an Uninstall disk and Setup cannot
complete, do not try to use your computer except as directed by
Microsoft Product Support Services. Otherwise, you could lose data.

NOTE  If you have a version of MS-DOS earlier than 5.0, and you plan
to use the /G switch or the /H and /G switches together, follow the
instructions in the NETWORKS.TXT file to update your network software
before running Setup.

1.15 Installing MS-DOS 6.22 on a System with a CorelSCSI UNI_ASP.SYS Driver
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
If your system uses the CorelSCSI UNI_ASP.SYS device driver for optical
drives, and Setup stops running when you try to install MS-DOS 6,
delete the DEVICE command in your CONFIG.SYS that loads the Corel
UNI_ASP.SYS driver. Then run Setup again. After Setup is complete,
reinstall the Corel UNI_ASP.SYS driver as you originally installed it.
If you continue to have problems, contact Corel Customer Service.

1.16  Installing MS-DOS 6.22 if you have DrivePro or EZ-Drive
------------------------------------------------------------
If Setup detects that your hard disk was set up using Micro House
DrivePro(tm) or EZ-Drive(tm), you must run the DOS6INST.EXE program
before you can safely install MS-DOS 6.22. The DOS6INST.EXE program
is provided on the Micro House diskette; it is also available on
the Micro House BBS at (303)443-9957. For further assistance,
contact Micro House Technical Support.

1.17 Setup displays the "There is not enough free disk space" screen
    and you are running PC-DOS version 6.1 with compression
--------------------------------------------------------------------
If your computer is running PC-DOS version 6.1 with PC-DOS disk
compression, when you run MS-DOS Setup, it displays the message
"There is not enough free disk space on drive C to install MS-DOS."

PC-DOS disk compression is incompatible with MS-DOS. Before you
install MS-DOS 6.22, you must first uninstall your PC-DOS disk
compression from all your compressed drives and then completely
remove PC-DOS disk compression. For more information, see "Upgrading
from PC-DOS 6.1" later in this file.

Note: If you have completely uninstalled PC-DOS compression and this
     message still occurs, you also need to free some space on drive C.

1.18  Setup cannot update a file
--------------------------------
If Setup cannot update one of your MS-DOS files, it displays a message
with the title "Cannot Update File." If you continued Setup, your MS-DOS
6.22 installation is incomplete because the specified file was not updated
to version 6.22. If the file is one you know you don't need (for example,
if it's a DoubleSpace file and you don't use DoubleSpace), don't worry
about it. (If you are running PC-DOS 6.1, see section 1.20 of this file).
If you are not sure, update the file using the following procedure (you
will need your MS-DOS 6.0 distribution disks):

1. If you use DoubleSpace and the file that was not updated was a
  DoubleSpace file, or if your system does not work properly after
  you receive this error message, insert your Uninstall disk in
  drive A and type A:\UNINSTAL at the command prompt.

2. Insert MS-DOS 6.0 Setup Disk 1 (not MS-DOS 6.22 Setup Disk 1) in
  drive A or drive B, and then use MS-DOS Editor (EDIT) to view
  the contents of the PACKING.LST file. This file tells you where each
  file is located on your MS-DOS 6.0 disks. Determine which MS-DOS 6.0
disk

  contains the file you need.

3. Insert the appropriate MS-DOS 6 disk in drive A or drive B, and then
  use the EXPAND command to expand the file. For example, to expand the
  file DRVSPACE.BI_ from the disk in drive A to the directory C:\DOS,
  you would type the following  command:

    EXPAND A:\DRVSPACE.BI_ C:\DOS\DRVSPACE.BIN

  For more information, see the comments at the beginning of the
PACKING.LST

  file, or see the MS-DOS 6 User's Guide.

4. Run MS-DOS 6.22 Setup again. This time, Setup should be able to update
the

  file.

1.19 Upgrading from PC-DOS 6.1
------------------------------
If your computer is running PC-DOS version 6.1 with PC-DOS disk
compression, you cannot install MS-DOS 6.22 until you remove the
disk compression. This is because PC-DOS disk compression is
incompatible with MS-DOS. Follow these steps:

1. First, uninstall your PC-DOS disk compression from all your
  compressed drives. (For information on uncompressing PC-DOS
  compressed drives, see the information on the SSUNCOMP command
  in the PC-DOS documentation.)

2. When SSUNCOMP uncompresses your last compressed drive, it asks
  if you want to disable the driver. Answer Yes to remove the
  PC-DOS version of the DRVSPACE.BIN file.

3. Change to the directory that contains your PC-DOS files, and
  then type the following command:

    DEL DRVSPACE.*

4. Insert MS-DOS 6.22 Setup Disk 1 in drive A or drive B, and then
  type A:SETUP or B:SETUP.

1.20  Changes to International Keyboard and Character Set Support
-----------------------------------------------------------------
MS-DOS 6.22 includes new codepage information files EGA2.CPI,
EGA3.CPI and ISO.CPI, as well as the new KEYBRD2.SYS file, which
offers additional keyboards. MS-DOS also includes new country settings
in COUNTRY.SYS.

For details about enhancements to the international keyboard and codepage
(character set) support, see the COUNTRY.TXT file, which is located in
the directory that contains your MS-DOS files.

2. MEMMAKER AND MEMORY MANAGEMENT
=================================

2.1 Intel Expanded-Memory Driver (EMM.SYS)
------------------------------------------
If you use Intel's EMM.SYS driver with Aboveboard, use EMM.SYS
version 4.0 revision E if you an ISA system, or EMM.SYS version 4.0
revision D if you have an MCA or other system. Contact Intel for a
free upgrade.

2.2 Running MemMaker on a Computer with PC-NFS
----------------------------------------------
If you use PC-NFS network software, carry out the following procedure
before you run MemMaker:

1. Open your MEMMAKER.INF file by using any text editor. This file is
  in the directory that contains your MS-DOS files.

2. Add the following line to the file:

  *NET

3. Save the file, and then run MemMaker.

2.3 You have a Super VGA display and want to conserve memory.
-------------------------------------------------------------
If you use Microsoft Windows on an 80386 computer with extended
memory and a Super VGA display, you can use the MONOUMB.386 file, in
conjunction with MemMaker, to conserve conventional memory for
running programs.

To conserve memory if you have a Super VGA display:

1. Open your Windows SYSTEM.INI file, and find the [386Enh] section.

2. Add a DEVICE command for the MONOUMB.386 file, which is located
  in your MS-DOS directory. For example, if your MS-DOS files are in
  C:\DOS, add the following line to this section:

  DEVICE=C:\DOS\MONOUMB.386

3. Save the file, and restart your computer.

4. After your computer starts, run MemMaker by typing MEMMAKER at the
  command prompt.

5. Choose Custom Setup. On the Advanced Options screen, answer Yes to
  the question "Use monochrome region (B000-B7FF) for running programs?"

  Follow the instructions on your screen.
