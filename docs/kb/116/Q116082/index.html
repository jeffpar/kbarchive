SUMMARY
=======

The VBMCI sample shows how to use the function "mciSendString()" in Microsoft
Visual Basic to play multimedia files. This sample also uses the custom control
"MMControl" from the MCI.VBX custom-control file to play multimedia files. You
may find it easier to use MMControl to manipulate multimedia files than to use
mciSendString() commands.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  Vbmci.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/platformsdk/sample85/3.1/W31/EN-US/VBMCI.EXE)

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

This sample demonstrates only a few of the features of MMControl and a few of the
commands strings that mciSendString() can use. The "Microsoft Visual Basic
Professional Features," Book 1, contains a complete description of all of the
features of MMControl.

The following files are included in the file VBMCI.EXE:

  FORM1.FRM
  FRMABOUT.FRM
  GLOBAL.BAS
  MCIVBX.FRM
  OPENDLG.FRM
  README.TXT
  VBMCISTR.MAK

REFERENCES
==========

You can find more information on command strings that you can send by using
mciSendString() in the following resources:

- "Multimedia Programmer's Reference," included with the Windows 3.1 Software
  Development Kit (SDK).

- "Multimedia Programmer's Guide," included with the Windows 3.1 SDK.

- MCISTRWH.HLP, a Windows Help file included with Microsoft Visual C++,
  Professional Edition, version 1.X.

- DK_DOC.MVB or DK_DOC.HLP, Windows Help files included with the Video for
  Windows Development Kit, version 1.1. (NOTE: These Help files also contain
  information on the controls in the MCI.VBX and MCIWNDX.VBX custom-control
  files.)

The "Microsoft Video for Windows Development Kit," version 1.1, comes with a
robust sample of how to use the features of the custom-control file MCIWNDX.VBX.
This sample is called "VBMCITst".

In addition, there is a helpful topic in both the DK_DOC.HLP and DK_DOC.MVB files
titled "Comparing MCIWNDX.VBX to MCI.VBX".
