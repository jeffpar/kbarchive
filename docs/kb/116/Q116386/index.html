-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, versions 2.0, 7.0 
- Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

SYMPTOMS
========

When all the objects in an application that is running in the run-time version
of Microsoft Access are minimized, focus is passed to the Database window even
though the Database window is not visible.

If you press a key or key combination that is a valid command in the Database
window while all the objects in the application are minimized, the Database
window command corresponding to the key or key combination will be carried out.
Examples of a key or a key combination that are valid commands in the Database
window include ENTER, which opens or runs the currently selected object, and
ALT+N, which creates a new object.

RESOLUTION
==========

Include a form in the application that cannot be minimized.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Many Microsoft Access applications include a Main Menu or Main Switchboard form
that is automatically opened with the AutoExec macro and stays open the entire
time that the application is open. This form is a good choice for a form that
cannot be minimized.

The following form property settings will prevent the form from being minimized:

  Property        Setting
  -----------------------------------------------------------------
  Min Max Buttons   No  (Microsoft Access 97 and 7.0 property only)
  Min Button        No  (Version 2.0 property only)
  Control Box       No

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open the sample database Northwind.mdb (or NWIND.MDB in version 2.0).

2. In Microsoft Access 97 and 7.0:

  a. On the Tools menu, click Startup.

  b. In the Startup dialog box, under Display Form, select Main Switchboard as
     the startup form.

  In Microsoft Access 2.0:

  Create a new macro with the following action, and then save the macro as
  AutoExec:

           Action: OpenForm
           FormName: Main Switchboard

3. Quit Microsoft Access.

4. On the Start Menu click Run. (Or in Windows 3.x, in Program Manager, choose
  Run from the File menu.)

5. In the Open box (or Command Line box in Windows 3.x), type the following
  line, and then press ENTER.

  NOTE: In the following command, an underscore (_) at the end of a line is used
  as a line-continuation character. Remove the underscore from the end of the
  line when re-creating this command.

  In Microsoft Access 97:

  "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Msaccess.exe _
        C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Samples\Northwind.mdb_
        /Runtime"

  In Microsoft Access version 7.0:

  C:\MSOffice\Access\Msaccess.exe _
        C:\MSOffice\Access\Samples\Northwind.mdb /Runtime

  In Microsoft Access version 2.0:

  C:\ACCESS\MSARN200.EXE C:\ACCESS\SAMPAPPS\NWIND.MDB _
        /INI C:\WINDOWS\MSACC20.INI

6. After Microsoft Access starts and the Main Switchboard form opens, minimize
  the Main Switchboard form.

7. Press ENTER or ALT+N. Note that because these are valid commands in the
  Database window, the Database window command is carried out.
