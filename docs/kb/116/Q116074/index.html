The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Complete Baseball for Windows, version 1994 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Complete Baseball Trivia game, the default options Pre-Game
Warmup and All (under categories) are selected. If you play a game with other
settings and then exit from and return to Trivia, your custom settings will not
be retained. Instead, the Trivia game will again be set to the default options.
However, the name of the most recent player is remembered and selected by
default.

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Click the Trivia selection on the Baseball Contents screen. The Trivia screen
  will appear, explaining the various game options.

2. Click the Start Game button in the upper-right corner of the screen. A dialog
  box will appear in which you can type your name (or, if you have entered it
  before, you can select it from a list). Select a name from the list or type
  in a Player Name.

3. At the bottom of this dialog box, select All-Star Challenge and choose OK.

4. The Change Category dialog box appears. Select Baseball Characters and choose
  OK.

5. The Trivia game screen appears. The first question is displayed, with
  multiple-choice answers. Select the letter representing the answer you think
  is correct.

6. Click the End Game button in the upper-right corner of the screen.

7. Exit from Trivia by choosing the Contents button in the lower-left corner of
  the screen.

8. Click the Trivia selection again to return to Trivia.

9. Click the Start Game button.

Even though you chose All-Star Challenge and selected Baseball Characters as your
category the last time you played, the Trivia game will return to its default
settings of Pre-Game Warmup and All as your category.
