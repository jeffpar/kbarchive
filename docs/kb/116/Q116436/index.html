-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2, on platform(s):
   - the operating system: MS-DOS 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Mail sent from the MS-DOS client may be misdirected mail if a mail message is
composed but is not sent until after a rebuild of the global address list (GAL)
is completed.

CAUSE
=====

The global address list (GAL) contains unique tuple identifiers (TIDs) for local
users as well as users external to the postoffice. When the GAL is rebuilt, new
users are added whose names may occur alphabetically before the user to whom the
message was addressed in the MS-DOS client. When this happens, the addressee
essentially is "moved down" in the list and is assigned a new TID.

However, this TID value is used to retrieve the name from the GALNETPO.GLB file.
The GALNETPO.GLB contains the name and external mailbag reference of the
addressee. If the name associated with the TID value is different from that in
the message composed in the MS-DOS client, mail will be delivered to the user
associated with that TID value.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.0 and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, MS-DOS workstation. This problem was corrected
in version 3.2.4 of REBUILD.EXE. If you do not have version 3.2.4 (or later),
you can download REBUPD.EXE, a self-extracting file, on the following services:

- Microsoft's World Wide Web Site on the Internet

  On the www.microsoft.com home page, click the Support icon.
  Click Knowledge Base, and select the product.
  Enter kbfile REBUPD.EXE, and click GO!
  Open the article, and click the button to download the file.

- Internet (anonymous FTP)

  ftp ftp.microsoft.com
  Change to the Softlib/Mslfiles folder.
  Get REBUPD.EXE

- The Microsoft Network

  On the Edit menu, click Go To, and then click Other Location.
  Type "mssupport" (without the quotation marks).

MORE INFORMATION
================

You should replace all 3.2 versions of the Rebuild program with version 3.2.4
(or later).

If you have Mail 3.0 or 3.0b, you cannot run Rebuild 3.2.4 with directory
synchronization (Dir-Sync); you should upgrade to Mail 3.2 or follow the
suggestions given on page 193 of the Mail 3.2 "Administrator's Guide":

  IMPORTANT: Perform manual synchronization only when users are not actively
  using the mail system.

You should ensure that all users all logged off the mail system before you
performing Dir-Sync.
