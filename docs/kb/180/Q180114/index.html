The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
- Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1

SYMPTOMS
========

The following errors may occur in Windows NT when connecting to a Windows NT
Workstation or a member Windows NT Server computer with User Manager or Server
Manager:

  The trust relationship between this workstation and the domain failed.

Additionally, the following 5770 and 5722 errors may occur in the event log on a
primary domain controller:

Netlogon Event ID 5722:

  The session setup from the computer CSWINS failed to authenticate. The
  name of the account referenced in the security database is CSWINS$. The
  following error occurred:

  Access is denied.

Netlogon Event ID 5770:

  The session setup to the Windows NT Domain Controller &lt;\\server&gt; from
  computer CSWINS using account CSWINS$ failed. CSWINS2 is declared to be
  a BDC in domain &lt;domain_name&gt;. However, CSWINS2 tried to connect as
  either a DC in a trusted domain, a member workstation in domain
  &lt;domain_name&gt;, or as a server in domain &lt;domain_name&gt;. Use the
  Server
  Manager to remove the BDC account for CSWINS.

And the following errors will occur on the target workstation or member server:

Netlogon Event ID 5719:

  No Windows NT Domain Controller is available for domain &lt;domain_name&gt;.
  The following error occurred:

  There are currently no logon servers available to service the logon
  request.

NOTE: This event is expected and can be ignored when booting with the No Net
Hardware Profile.

Netlogon Event ID 3210:

  Failed to authenticate with &lt;\\server&gt;, a Windows NT domain controller
  for domain &lt;domain_name&gt;.

CAUSE
=====

Workstation and stand-alone server computer accounts are mistakenly treated as
LanMan backup domain controllers (BDC) by the primary domain controller (PDC).
LanMan BDCs are declared as such in a Windows NT domain by creating a special
Windows NT global group called servers, creating user accounts that correspond
to the computer names of the LanMan BDCs, and placing those user accounts in the
servers group.

Authentication with the PDC fails when the accounts in the servers group are
actually Windows NT workstations and servers. This is because Windows NT will
use the secure channel account password against to authenticate with the PDC.
The PDC finds a matching user account in the servers group for the Windows NT
system and treats it as a LanMan BDC. During challenge/response authentication,
the PDC uses the user account password instead of the secure channel password to
authenticate the Windows NT system. This causes the errors noted in the summary.

RESOLUTION
==========

If no LanMan BDCs exist, then remove the servers group and restart the Netlogon
service on the PDC.

If LanMan BDCs exist, then remove the user accounts for the Windows NT systems
experiencing this problem from the servers group. Restart the Netlogon service
on the PDC.
