-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Windows NT Server Performance Monitor locally on a computer
running SNA Server and you pressing the "+" key (which loads the extension
Performance Monitor DLLs, including snaperf.dll), the following errors may
occur:

- All Performance Monitor objects and counters are blank, even SNA Server ones.
  When you start Performance Monitor under a debugger, it indicates that the
  Performance Monitor heap is corrupted. This causes Performance Monitor
  (Perfmon.exe) to encounter an access violation (0xC0000005).

- When you start Performance Monitor on another system, focus on the computer
  running SNA Server 4.0, and press the "+" key, an access violation
  (0xC0000005) occurs in Winlogon.exe, leading to a STOP 0xC000021A.

- The following log entry may appear in the &lt;ntroot&gt;\drwtsn32.log file:

  Application exception occurred:
  App: exe\winlogon.dbg (&lt;process ID&gt;)
  Exception number: c0000005 (access violation)
  [...]
  function: RtlAllocateHeap
  [...]

NOTE: A similar access violation problem may occur with SNA Server 3.0, though
this problem is fixed when applying 3.0 Service Pack 2.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by a regression introduced in SNA Server 4.0 when support
for multiple instances of the SNA Server service on a single computer was added.
However, multiple SNA Server services do not need to be configured in order to
encounter this problem.


WORKAROUND
==========

Do not run Windows NT Performance Monitor against SNA Server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following word in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

3.0, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
