-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you uninstall and then reinstall the Domain Name System (DNS) Server
service in Windows NT Server, some of the previously created DNS servers may
still be listed in the DNS Manager.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because some of the registry keys are not removed when
you uninstall the DNS Server service. Specifically, the registry keys that
define the DNS servers that can be administered through the local DNS Manager
may not be removed.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To reinstall the DNS Server service without previous DNS servers listed in the
DNS Manager, uninstall the DNS Server service, use Registry Editor to delete the
DNS Administrator key under the following registry key, and then reinstall the
DNS Server service:

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft

MORE INFORMATION
================

The above registry key is created when the DNS Server service is installed and
at least one server is created in the DNS Administrator. The registry key may
not be deleted when the DNS Server service is removed. This key includes
information for the servers added into DNS Manager, including the server's name
and Internet Protocol (IP) address. Registry entries are created for each server
that DNS Manager lists.
