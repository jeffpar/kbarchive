-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Server client for Windows 95 retrieves the wrong password from the cache
during its initialization. Because the wrong password is obtained, account
validation fails and the user is unable to get an application session through
SNA Server.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server client for Windows 95 does not expect its call to retrieve the
password to succeed because the Windows 95 system does not have a password
cache. If the call succeeds, the password retrieved by the client is not the
correct password for the user.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0SP1,
3.0 SP2, and 4.0.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server versions 3.0 and 4.0 U.S.
Service Packs. For information on obtaining these Service Packs, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

  S E R V P A C K


MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, the call to retrieve the password from the cache is
disabled by default. To enable the client to retrieve the password, use the
following steps:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Apply the fix.

2. Start the Windows 95 Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) and find the following
  key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SnaBase\Parameters

3. Add the following String Value:

  Value Name: UseCachedPassword
  String: True
