SUMMARY
=======

A useful resource for information offered through the various Advisor Technical
Magazines and Conferences is the Advisor.com Web page located at:

  http:\\www.advisor.com

MORE INFORMATION
================

The site allows searching past issue summaries for articles by index, author,
and by an index of advertisers.

The site also provides a limited number of complete articles. FoxPro Advisor
Magazine also offers a series of compact discs containing source code and a
year's worth of magazines on compact disc.

Here are some of the key points of these pages:

- List Articles by Author

- Article Index

- Article Online

- Index of Advertisers

- Order Information for Back Issues and Companion Code

Jumps are available to all magazines supported by the Advisor Magazine series.
Depending on your Web browser and screen resolution, the link to FoxPro Advisor
Magazine is located on page one or page two.

Use the Index of Advertisers to find e-mail addresses, phone numbers, and street
addresses for third-party FoxPro suppliers.

The author index jump produces a list authors. Clicking the FoxPro Advisor
Magazine link, then the Articles Index link, and finally the Advisor Articles
Index by Writer jump provides a quick list of authors and their contributions.
