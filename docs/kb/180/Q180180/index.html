-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a Microsoft Mail user forwards an unedited message that includes several
attachments to an Exchange user via the Microsoft Mail Connector, it is possible
that the last attachment may be lost. Also, if the forwarded message ends with
text, it is possible that the Exchange recipient will receive the message with
the last part of the text missing.

CAUSE
=====

When an unedited Exchange message is forwarded to an Exchange user, it is
possible that it does not end with a CRLF (carriage return, line feed). When
such a message enters Exchange, the message transfer agent (MTA) truncates the
last portion of the message data.

If the forwarded message includes several attachments, then the truncation action
might remove the last attachment. In this case, the Exchange recipient will
receive the message with the last attachment lost. If the the last object in the
message is in a text format, then the Exchange user may receive the message with
some missing text at the end.

WORKAROUND
==========

Before forwarding such a message, edit it by adding some text after the
attachments and after the important text in the body of the message. This will
force the client to rewrite and reformat the message, which will then preserve
the attachments. The extra text is added as a precaution to guarantee that there
is no important text lost.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
