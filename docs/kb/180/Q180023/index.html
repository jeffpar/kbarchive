The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain conditions, you may be unable to access all of the commands in
Word, or you may be unable to move the insertion point to certain areas of the
document.

NOTE: Unavailable menu commands appear grayed or dimmed on the Word menus.
Keyboard commands that edit or format text and graphics are also unavailable.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur if document protection is enabled. The "More Information"
section of this document lists commands that are unavailable when document
protection is enabled.

NOTE: It is possible to customize all of the menus, keyboard commands, and so
forth, with AutoNew macros. Also, add-in products (such as Microsoft Internet
Explorer or Microsoft Bookshelf) modify menu choices.

Customization may also produce the behavior described in the "Symptoms" section
of this article.

WORKAROUND
==========

To gain access to all of the menu commands and areas of a document, unprotect
the document.

To unprotect a document, click Unprotect Document on the Tools menu.

MORE INFORMATION

To protect a Word document for Tracked Changes, Comments, or Forms, follow these
steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Protect Document.

2. Click either Tracked Changes, Comments, or Forms, and then click OK.
