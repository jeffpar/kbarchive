The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When using Capture.exe that ships with File and Print Services for NetWare
(FPNW) and printing to a German File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW)
server using a command similar to the following:

  CAPTURE L=2 S=fpnw-srv Q=printer NT

The job does not print although it does show up in the queue for a very short
time.

CAUSE
=====

To reflect the options entered when capturing the printer, FPNW uses the job
data types of the Windows NT printing system. Here is how the CAPTURE options
map:

  &lt;no option&gt;: TEXT
  NT NFF: RAW
  NT: RAW [FF appended]
  &lt;other cases&gt;: default data type

In German FPNW, RAW [FF appended] is localized to RAW [FF angehaengt] where ae is
a German Umlaut. This string is not localized in the Windows NT printing
system.

Because the datatype RAW [FF angehaengt] is rejected by the printing subsystem on
the German server, FPNW cancels the print job and returns the NCP request with
an error message.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

FPNW has registry entries to set the strings for the data types used above. The
path below shows the location of this registry key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\FPNW\Parameters.

This is the list of entries and their default values for US-English Windows NT:

Value name: DefaultTextDatatype
Data type: REG_SZ
String: TEXT

Value name: DefaultRawDatatype
Data type: REG_SZ
String: RAW

Value name: DefaultRawFFDatatype
Data type: REG_SZ
String: RAW [FF appended]

The entries do not exist and have to be added manually.

To solve the problem, add a new value DefaultRawFFDatatype with the string RAW
[FF appended] and restart the FPNW service. To do this, perform the following
steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and go to the following subkey:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\FPNW\Parameters.

2. From the Edit menu, click Add Value. Type the following information and then
  click OK.

  Value name: DefaultRawFFDatatype
  Data Type: REG_SZ
  String: RAW [FF appended]

3. Quit Registry Editor and restart your computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem occurs if you run NetWare clients with some MS-DOS applications
where you do not want to use tab expansion (description below), but want the
server to append a Form Feed to the print job.

Using Capture.exe that comes with FPNW, this would be an example command line:

  CAPTURE L=2 S=fpnw-srv Q=printer NT

Windows NT tells the system not to expand tab characters (ASCII 0x09) in the
print job to spaces. It does not matter whether you use Microsoft's or Novell's
version of Capture.exe or if you use the Nwuser.exe tool under Windows to
capture the LPT port.

The problem is that the job does not get printed. It shows up only for a short
time in the Windows NT queue.

In a network trace you can see a NCP request Create Queue Job Extended sent to
FPNW, but the response frame contains error code 0xD0 (Queue Error).

Without the Windows NT option or by adding NFF (No Form Feed), the print jobs get
printed but you have side effects like distorted printouts or you manually have
to add a Form Feed.
