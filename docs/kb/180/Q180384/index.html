SUMMARY
=======

Attempting to access a DCOM Server from a remote client application sometimes
results in the following error:

  Run-time error '70':
  Permission Denied

This article describes the most common scenarios in which this error is raised.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Run-time error '70' is typically the result of a security or permissions issue.
The following is a list of possible causes of run-time error 70 but is by no
means a complete or definitive list.

DCOM Is Not Enabled
-------------------

If the Server machine does not have DCOM enabled, client machines will receive
run-time error 70 when attempting to access the server. This scenario applies to
Windows 2000, Windows NT, Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows Me servers:

1. On the Server machine, run DCOM Config (DCOMCNFG.EXE).

2. Choose the Default Properties tab.

3. Ensure that Enable Distributed COM on this computer is checked. This value is
  stored in the Windows Registry at the following location:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\OLE

The Client User Does Not Have Sufficient Permissions
----------------------------------------------------

If the client user does not have the correct permissions, access to the DCOM
Server can be denied. There are several steps to take in order to ensure your
client has valid privileges.

If the Server is Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows Me:

1. Run DCOM Config.

2. Select the DCOM Server application from the list of available applications.

3. Select the Properties button, or double-click the DCOM Server application in
  the list.

4. Test the server with "Default Access Permissions."

  If run-time error '70' still occurs, the default access permissions are
  restricting your user. If this is the case, then modify the Default Access
  Permissions from the Default Security tab in DCOM Config. Grant the client
  user access permissions.

  If run-time error '70' does not occur running with default access permissions,
  it is likely that the custom access permissions are restricting your client
  from accessing the DCOM Server. Choose custom access permissions and select
  the Edit button. Grant the client user access permissions.

If the Server is Windows NT or Windows 2000:

1. Run DCOM Config.

2. Select the DCOM Server application from the list of available applications.

3. Select the Properties button, or double-click the DCOM Server application in
  the list.

4. Test the server with "Default Access Permissions," "Default Launch
  Permissions," and "Custom Configuration Permissions."

  If run-time error '70' still occurs, it is likely that the default access
  permissions are restricting your user. If this is the case, modify the
  Default Access Permissions from the Default Security tab in DCOM Config.

  If run-time error '70' does not occur, it is likely that the custom access
  permissions are restricting your client from accessing the DCOM Server.
  Choose to use Custom access permissions and choose the Edit button. Grant the
  client user account access permissions, or grant a group the client user
  belongs to access permissions.

For more information regarding security groups on Windows NT see the table to
follow.

There are several group accounts you will find when you configure users and
groups on Windows NT and Windows 2000. The following list is a summary of who
belongs to each group:

Group                     Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Interactive               Includes all users who log onto a Windows NT or
                         Windows 2000 system locally (at the console). It 
                         does not include users who connect to NT
                         resources across a network or are started as a 
                         server.

Network                   Includes all users who connect to Windows NT or
                         Windows 2000 resources across a network. It does 
                         not include those who connect through an 
                         interactive logon.

Creator/Owner             The Creator/Owner group is created for each
                         sharable resource in the Windows NT or
                         Windows 2000 system. Its membership is the set of 
                         users who either create a resource (such as a 
                         file) and who take ownership of them.

Everyone                  All users who access the system, whether locally,
                         remotely, or across the network.

System                    The local operating system.

The above list includes the group accounts which are intrinsic to Windows NT and
Windows 2000 systems. Your particular network may include more groups from which
you may choose. In order to determine the membership of each custom group
account, you must contact your network administrator.

Attempting to Access DCOM Server Across Non-Trusted Domains
-----------------------------------------------------------

If your DCOM Server resides in one Windows NT or Windows 2000 domain, and your
client logs on to a second Windows NT or Windows 2000 domain that is not
"trusted" by the first, you will receive run-time error '70' when attempting to
access the DCOM Server.
