SUMMARY
=======

The Systems Management Server service account is used by the Site Configuration
Manager, Hierarchy Manager, and Systems Management Server Executive services.
This account is also used for the Package Command Manager (PCM) client component
service on Systems Management Server logon servers in the site. Because this
account sets up and maintains directories and shares, installs services, and
writes to the registry, it requires local Administrator rights on the computers
it maintains (including logon servers, distribution servers, and helper
servers). Additionally, if the "Auto-detect All Logon Servers" option is
enabled, every member server will also have the Systems Management Server
Inventory Agent and the PCM service installed on them. The PCM service on these
servers uses the Systems Management Server service account.

When security boundaries must be drawn to fit into an organizational or
administrative model, Systems Management Server hierarchies should be developed.
Each site should contain its own service account and password. When a site
hierarchy is developed along security divisions, it is necessary to not have
multiple sites in a single domain, because the account for each site must reside
in the domain.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Generally speaking, the less secure the environment, the easier it is to
administer, in terms of deployment and password changes. A secure environment
requires more complex administration.

Normally, the Systems Management Server service account is granted Domain
Administrator rights to the domains within the site. When this is done, there is
an assumption made that the local administrator of the site server and logon
servers is also a Domain Administrator, and visa versa.

It is possible to have a multiple site hierarchy and have all sites use the same
account and password. If Systems Management Server is configured this way,
account maintenance is simplified. Multiple sites with unique passwords require
more account maintenance. It is also possible to create a user account for the
sender (a thread of the Systems Management Server Executive service) to use for
inter-site communications. The sender account does not need to be a Domain
Administrator, rather a Domain User with limited rights. The only requirement of
the sender account is that it must have Administrator rights on each site
server's SMS_SITE share (&lt;SMS_root&gt;\Sms\Despooler.box\Receive). After
creating a user account, you can configure the sender to use a specified account
in the Addresses portion of the Site Properties.

For more information, refer to the Concepts and Planning Guide in the online
documentation.
