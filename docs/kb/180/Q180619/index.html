-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Server service may stop unexpectedly and log the following Event ID in
the Windows NT Event Viewer Application log:

  Event ID: 685
  Source: SNA Server
  Description: An attempt was made to extend a buffer pool, but
  the related pool had reached its maximum size. The affected component is
  terminating, and an audit of the buffer pools just before termination is
  attached

  &lt;the data will indicate a large number of trusted headers owned by the
  SNASERVR process &gt;

This event will be preceded by numerous Event 684 messages, which indicate that
the SNA Server's trusted header use is growing by about 150 per minute until the
maximum trusted header pool is reached (of 100,000). When this occurs, SNA
Server stops.

This problem coincides with the use of an APPC application that uses the DISPLAY
API function to retrieve all LU6.2 configuration and state information.

CAUSE
=====

When receiving an APPC DISPLAY request from an APPC application to retrieve
LU6.2 information, SNA Server occasionally allocates an extra trusted header it
doesn't actually use and then fails to free it.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1
and 3.0 SP2. This problem is fixed in SNA 4.0.

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
