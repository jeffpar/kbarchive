  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When use a program and you want to print text files from the program, you may
use the Generic/Text Only printer driver. However, if you want to use Eastern
European characters that are specific to the locale, those characters are
printed as an at (@) symbol (characters that are above 0x80 in the American
National Standards Institute [ANSI] code page).

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the Windows NT 4.0 implementation of the
Generic/Text Only driver does not have sufficient information to convert Easter
European code pages.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem.

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information on support costs, please go to the following address on the World
Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may

  Date         Time   Version  Size    File name  Platform
  --------------------------------------------------------
  12-Nov-2001  23:46  0.2.0.0  73,200  Rasdd.dll  Intel

NOTE: Due to file dependencies, this hotfix requires Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
Service Pack 6a (SP6a).



To use the fix, you must set a registry value. To do this:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate and click the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Printers\Generic /
  Text Only\PrinterDriverData

3. Click Add Value on the Edit menu, and then add the following registry value:

  Value name: SpecialRLE
  Data type: REG_BINARY

4. Quit Registry Editor.

5. To activate this setting, restart the computer.
