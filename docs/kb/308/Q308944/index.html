SYMPTOMS
========

MSN Explorer will not allow you to write text in the body of a new e-mail
message.

CAUSE
=====

This can be caused by a corruption of the spell check dictionary on the
computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

Run the detect and repair utility in Microsoft Word.

To run the detect and repair utility in Microsoft Word

1. Start Microsoft Word.

2. On the top menu, click Help.

3. Click Detect and Repair.

4. On the dialog box that appears, click Start, and then follow directions to
  complete the operation.
  Note: This may require the installation CD for Microsoft Word.

If this does not resolve the problem, you may have to uninstall and re-install
Microsoft Office to resolve the issue.

To uninstall and re-install Microsoft Office

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

3. Find Microsoft Office in the list of programs, and then click the Add/Remove
  button.
  Note: If you get a warning dialog box, click the Yes button.

4. After the installation finishes, click "OK", and then quit Control Panel.

5. Download and run the appropriate eraser utility for the version of Office
  that was on your computer:

  - For Office 2000, go to:
  http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q239/9/38.asp?FinishURL=%2Fdownloads%2Frelease%2Easp%3FReleaseID%3D29253%26redirect%3Dno

  http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q176/8/23.asp?FinishURL=%2Fdownloads%2Frelease%2Easp%3FReleaseID%3D29254%26redirect%3Dno
  Click the Download Eraser97.exe now link to download the utility. 6. After
  the eraser utility finishes, re-install Office.

  Checker feature.
