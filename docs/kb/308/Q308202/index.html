SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article describes how to create and configure a catalog for
indexing in Windows 2000. Windows 2000 Indexing Service creates an index of
document content and properties (such as file name, date created, date modified,
author name, and number of characters) on your local hard disks and on shared
network drives. The index information is stored in catalogs.

After you create an index of documents and start Indexing Service (it is not
started by default), you can use any of the following methods to perform queries
to search the index for specific text in documents or document properties:

- Start Microsoft Windows Explorer, and then click Search.

- Click Search on the Start menu.

- Use the Indexing Service query form. To do this, start the Indexing Service
  snap-in, click to expand the catalog that you want to search, and then click
  "Query the Catalog". The query form is displayed in the right pane.

- Use a Web browser to submit a query in a Web page that was created by a Web
  master or administrator.

When Indexing Service is installed with Windows 2000, the following catalogs are
automatically created:

- System catalog: By default, the System catalog lists all folders on all
  permanently attached disk drives. It contains an index for all file system
  documents (except certain system and temporary files). The System catalog is
  created in the volume of your hard disk that has the greatest available free
  space.

- Web catalog: If Internet Information Services (IIS) is installed, Indexing
  Service creates a Web catalog that contains an index of IIS content. By
  default, the Web catalog is created in the Inetpub folder.

You can add and remove additional catalogs or configure existing catalogs to meet
your requirements at any time.

Create a New Catalog
--------------------

To create a new catalog:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Administrative Tools, and then double-click Computer Management.

3. In the console tree, double-click "Services and Applications", and then
  double-click Indexing Service.

4. Right-click Indexing Service, point to New, and then click Catalog.

5. In the Name box, type a name for your new catalog.

6. Click Browse, click the folder in which you want your new catalog located,
  and then click OK twice.

7. When you receive the "Catalog will remain off-line until Indexing Service is
  restarted" message, click OK.

The new catalog is created and is listed under Indexing Service in the console
tree.

Define the Scope of the Catalog
-------------------------------

After you create a new catalog, you must add the folders that you want included
in the catalog's scope. The scope is the set of folders that is included in and
excluded from the catalog; the scope defines the content that is included and
excluded from the index. For each folder that is included or excluded, all of
its subfolders are also included or excluded.

To define the scope of the catalog:

1. In the console tree, double-click the catalog to expand the container (if it
  is not already expanded).

2. Right-click Directories, point to New, and then click Directory.

3. Click Browse, locate and click the folder that you want to add, and then
  click OK.

  If the folder that you add is located on a different computer, follow these
  steps:

  a. In the User Name box under Account Information, type the domain and user
     name of a user account that has permission to access that computer, for
     example, "&lt;domain&gt;\&lt;username&gt;" (without the quotation marks).

  b. In the Password box, type the password that is associated with the user
     account.

  c. In the Alias (UNC) box, type the Uniform Naming Convention (UNC) path to
     the folder, for example, "\\&lt;computername&gt;&lt;\sharename&gt;"
     (without the quotation marks).

4. Under "Include in Index", perform one of the following tasks:

   - Click Yes if you want to include the folder in the catalog.

     -or-

   - Click No if you want to exclude the folder from the catalog.

5. Click OK.

6. Repeat steps 2 through 5 to add additional folders to your catalog.

7. If Indexing Service is running, right-click Indexing Service in the console
  tree, and then click Stop.

8. Right-click Indexing Service, and then click Start.

The folders that you specified are now added and are either included or excluded
from the catalog. When you click Directories, the folders are listed in the
details pane of the Indexing Service dialog box.

NOTES:

- If the catalog is tracking a Web server, folders are added automatically.

- If you do not want an NTFS file system file or folder included in the index,
  follow these steps:

  a. Start Windows Explorer, and then locate and click the file or folder that
     you do not want to index.

  b. On the File menu, click Properties.

  c. Click the General tab, and then click Advanced.

  d. In the Advanced Attributes dialog box, click to clear the "For fast
     searching, allow Indexing Service to index this file" check box.

Configure the Catalog
---------------------

To configure the catalog:

1. In the Indexing Service dialog box, right-click the catalog that you want to
  configure, and then click Properties.

2. Click the General tab, and then click the Tracking tab.

3. Under Inheritable Settings, perform one of the following tasks:

   - If you want Indexing Service to use the share name of any shared folder as
     the alias for that folder, click to clear the "Inherit above settings from
     Service" check box, and then click to select the "Add Network Share Alias
     Automatically" check box.

     -or-

   - If you want to use the same settings as the service, click to select the
     "Inherit above settings from Service" check box (if it is not already
     selected).

4. If IIS is installed on your computer and you want to index a Web server,
  click the Web server that you want to index in the WWW Server box.

5. If the NNTP Service is installed and running on your computer and you want to
  index virtual news servers, click the NNTP virtual server that you want to
  use in the NNTP Server box.

6. Click the Generation tab.

7. Under Inheritable Settings, perform one or more of the following tasks:

   - If you want to index files with unknown extensions, click to clear the
     "Inherit above settings from Service" check box, and then click to select
     the "Index files with unknown extensions" check box.

   - If you want to generate abstracts for files that are found in a search,
     click to clear the "Inherit above settings from Service" check box, click
     to select the "Generate abstracts" check box, and then type a size limit
     for the abstracts in the "Maximize size" box.

   - If you want to use the same settings as the service, click to select the
     "Inherit above settings from Service" check box (if it is not already
     selected).

8. Click OK.

9. If Indexing Service is started, right-click Indexing Service in the console
  tree, and then click Stop.

10. Right-click Indexing Service, and then click Start.

Users can now search the index for documents that contain specific words,
phrases, or properties.

Troubleshooting
---------------

No Results Are Displayed in Search Results:

If the search does not return the expected search results when you query the
index, index data may be corrupted.

To troubleshoot this issue, stop and restart Indexing Service to reindex all
documents:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Administrative Tools, and then double-click Computer Management.

3. In the console tree, double-click "Services and Applications".

4. Right-click Indexing Service, and then click Stop.

5. Right-click Indexing Service, and then click Start.

Disk Is Full:

Indexing pauses temporarily if the volume in which the catalog is stored is low
on disk space. If there is very little disk space available (less than 20 MB),
Indexing Service pauses until more disk space is freed up. A message is logged
in the Event Viewer Application log when disk space on the volume that contains
the catalog starts to fill up.

To troubleshoot this issue, monitor the Application Log in Event Viewer for these
messages, and then free up disk space when necessary.

Specific Documents Are Not Indexed:

If Indexing Service detects corrupted files or if it continually has problems
accessing particular documents, those documents are marked as unindexed.

To troubleshoot this issue, use the Indexing Service query form to generate a
list of unindexed documents:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Administrative Tools, and then double-click Computer Management.

3. In the console tree, double-click "Services and Applications", and then
  double-click Indexing Service.

4. Click "Query the Catalog".

5. In the "Enter your free text query below" box, type "@unfiltered=true"
  (without the quotation marks), and then click Search.

  A list of unindexed documents is displayed below the query form in the details
  pane. If a specific type of document is not indexed consistently, investigate
  possible issues with the filter that is used to index those documents.

Network Connection Is Lost:

If folders in a catalog are located on remote computers, and the connection to
those network shares is lost, Indexing Service detects and scans the network
shares to determine when the connection is active again. You do not need to
reconfigure the catalog.
