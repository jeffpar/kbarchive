SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message may occur when running the previously mentioned Step
by Step Interactive (SBSI) training programs and when the training is installed
on an NTFS partition and you are not logged on with Owner, Administrator or
Power User privileges:

  Cannot open your DBF database files: Please verify that the path is correct
  and that the files are not read-only.
  Database Path: .\Database\ or C:\Program Files\MSPress\Training\Database\

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when the SBSI training program is installed on an NTFS
partition and you are not logged on with Owner, Administrator, or Power User
privileges. The SBSI training program requires that all users have write access
to the location where SBSI stores a number of .dbf files, typically in the
C:\Program Files\MSPress\Training\Database folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

An update is available that allows all user groups to successfully run the
training program on their local computers. The update should be run after the
installation of any of the Step by Step Interactive titles listed above. Saved
information such as custom users, progress and assessment information may be
lost when applying the patch on top of an already installed Step by Step
Interactive title.

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

Q308101.exe launches Q308101.vbs which in turn copies the database files from
C:\ProgramFiles\MSPress\Training\Database to C:\Documents and Settings\All
Users\Application Data\sbsi\lrun, or to the equivalent location on localized
versions of Microsoft Windows. The database files combined consume approximately
100 kb. The script then calls the Windows Cacls.exe tool to ensure that the
USERS group has write permissions added to the files copied.

Userid.exe provides the USERS alias as it is defined for the operating system
(localized or not). Finally, the script modifies the database path in the
lrun32.ini file which is located in the %windir% folder.

Q308101.exe is applicable for the following language versions of SBSI: English,
Brazilian Portuguese, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish and
Swedish.

Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) can view the ReadMe for instructions on
how to apply this update via the OEM Preinstall Kit (OPK).
