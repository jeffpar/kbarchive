-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Exchange Server Internet Mail Service may stop responding or "crash" after
attempting to deliver a message to an Exchange Server custom recipient that was
created by using Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if one of the recipients in the message has a missing
address type in its X.400 address. For example, the address is displayed as
follows in the Exchange Administrator program:

  G=firstname;S=surname;OU1=orgunit1;O=org;P=prmd;A=admd;C=us

Using a custom-made program that uses LDAP to create the recipient created the
preceding address. The address should look like the following address:

  X400:c=us;a=admd;p=prmd;o=org;ou1=orgunit1;s=surname;g=firstname;

The missing address type causes the issue with the Internet Mail Service.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.

article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue as an alternative to applying this fix, ensure that
any recipients that are created outside of the Exchange Server Administrator
program have correct address types in their proxy addresses.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.
