The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a keyset cursor is being used in a multi-user DataEnvironment, the MoveNext
and MovePrevious methods do not appear to update the recordset. If two users
change a record, the changes that are made by the first user are not reflected
in the second user's view of the data. This behavior occurs when the second user
navigates to the updated record by using the MoveNext or MovePrevious methods.
This behavior does not occur when the MoveFirst or MoveLast methods are used.

CAUSE
=====

The records are being retrieved from the cache and do not reflect concurrent
changes that other users have made to the source data.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the Cache Size setting of the Command object to 1. (The default value is
100.)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a bug in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in the latest
service pack for Visual Studio 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Data project. DataEnvironment1 and Connection1 are created by
  default.

2. Configure Connection1 to use OLE DB for SQL server.

3. Click to select the server name and the Pubs database.

4. Add a Command object to the connection.

5. Specify SQL and enter "Select * from authors" (without the quotation marks)
  in the SQL window.

6. Locate the Advanced tab. Under Cursor Location, click to select Server-side,
  under Cursor Type, click to select Keyset, and then under Lock Type, click to
  select Optimistic.

7. Drag the Command object to the frmDataEnv form (text boxes will be placed on
  the form).

8. Add four CommandButton controls to the form.

9. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Form1:

  Private Sub Form_Load()
      Command1.Caption = "Move Next"
      Command2.Caption = "Move Previous"
      Command3.Caption = "Move First"
      Command4.Caption = "Move Last"
  End Sub

  Private Sub Command1_Click()
      DataEnvironment1.rsCommand1.MoveNext
  End Sub

  Private Sub Command2_Click()
      DataEnvironment1.rsCommand1.MovePrevious
  End Sub

  Private Sub Command3_Click()
      DataEnvironment1.rsCommand1.MoveFirst
  End Sub

  Private Sub Command4_Click()
      DataEnvironment1.rsCommand1.MoveLast
  End Sub

10. Save the project with two different names and run both projects, or create
  an executable and run two instances of it.

11. In the first instance, move to the second record and make a change to a
  field. Click on Move Next to go to the third record.

  In the second instance, click on Move Next to go to the second record and
  note that the change is visible. This is as expected. Click on Move Previous
  to move back to the first record.

12. In the first instance, click on Move Previous to go to the second record and
  make another change. Click on Move Next to go to the third record.

  In the second instance, click on Move Next to go to the second record. Note
  that the second change does not appear. Note also that subsequent changes to
  any record do not appear. If you use MoveLast or MoveFirst, the records are
  refreshed and the changes do appear.
