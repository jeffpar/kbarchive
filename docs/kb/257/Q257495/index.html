SYMPTOMS
========

When you click on an item in a ListView control, the ItemClick event for the
ListView control executes twice.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by the way in which manual label editing is implemented.
When you select an item, the ItemClick event is fired normally, but, in
addition, the ListView control enables a built-in timer whose delay is equal to
that of the duration of a double-click. When this delay elapses, the timer's
event is triggered and the code for this timer determines if the ListView
control should enter the label editing mode. If label editing is aborted, which
is always the case for manual label editing, then the selection is cleared and
re-selected. This re-selection triggers the second ItemClick.

You can cause this problem to occur in one of two ways. The first is to set the
LabelEdit property of ListView to lvwManual (as in the sample code in the "More
Information" section of this article). An alternate way of reproducing this
behavior is to set the LabelEdit property to lvwAutomatic and set Cancel equal
to True in the BeforeLabelEdit event of ListView.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, install the latest service pack for Visual Studio 6.0.

If installing the service pack is not an option or you are running a version of
Visual Basic earlier than version 6.0, set the LabelEdit property of the
ListView control to lvwAutomatic and do not set Cancel equal to True in the in
the BeforeLabelEdit event of ListView.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a bug in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in the latest
service pack for Visual Studio 6.0.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
  default.

2. From the Project menu, choose Components, select Microsoft Windows Common
  Controls, and then click OK.

3. Add a ListView control to Form1.

4. Paste the following code into Form1's code window:

  Option Explicit

  Private Sub Form_Load()
      Dim Col As ColumnHeader
      Dim itmAdd As ListItem
      
      ' Set the report's view
      ListView1.View = lvwReport
      
      ' Add a column to the listview
      Set Col = ListView1.ColumnHeaders.Add(Text:="Items")
      
      ' Set the label editing to manual
      ListView1.LabelEdit = lvwManual
      
      ' Add some sample data
      Set itmAdd = ListView1.ListItems.Add(Text:="one")
      Set itmAdd = ListView1.ListItems.Add(Text:="two")
  End Sub

  Private Sub ListView1_ItemClick(ByVal Item As MSComctlLib.ListItem)
      Debug.Print ListView1.SelectedItem.Text
  End Sub

5. Run the sample.

6. Click item "two" in the ListView control. This should result in the text of
  item "two" being displayed in the debug/immediate window.

7. Wait a moment and then click item "two" again. This results in the text of
  item "two" being displayed two more times in the debug/immediate window.
