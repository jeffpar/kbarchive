Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Visual Basic Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. From the Project menu, choose Components, check Microsoft Chart Control 6.0,
  and then click OK.

3. Place an MSChart control on Form1.

4. Paste the following code into Form1's code window:

  Option Explicit

  Private Sub Form_Load()
    Dim i As Integer, j As Integer
    Dim series As Integer, rows As Integer
    
    MSChart1.chartType = VtChChartType2dStep
    
    series = 2
    rows = 5
    
    With MSChart1.DataGrid
        .ColumnCount = series
        .RowCount = rows
        For i = 1 To series
            For j = 1 To rows
                .SetData j, i, j * i, 0
            Next j
        Next i
    End With
  End Sub

  Private Sub MSChart1_PointSelected(series As Integer, DataPoint As Integer, MouseFlags As Integer, Cancel As Integer)
    MsgBox "Column = " &amp; series &amp; " DataPoint = " &amp; DataPoint
  End Sub

5. Press the F5 key to run the program. You should see two graphics plotted, one
  red and the other green.

6. Click on the last column (R5) on the green graphic to select it. Click again
  on the last column R5 (near level 9), and note that there is a message box
  displaying Column=2 and DataPoint=5. This means that you clicked on the
  second graphic (the green one) and the 5th point (in this case R5). This is
  the correct behavior.

7. Now click again on the green graphic and over R5, but this time near level 6.
  Note that the message box column is still 2 (correct), but DataPoint is 4.
  This is incorrect; it should be 5. This same problem occurs for R4, but not
  for R1 to R3.
