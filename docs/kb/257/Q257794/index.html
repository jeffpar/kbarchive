SUMMARY
=======

This article is intended as a supplement to the "Using Binary File Access" topic
in the MSDN Help. It provides a programming example based on the structures
discussed in that topic. The sample code demonstrates how to access both files
composed of fixed-length records using the Random access method, and files
composed of variable-length records using the Binary access method.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Create This Example:
-----------------------------

1. Start a new Visual Basic Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. On the Project menu, select Add Module to add a standard module to the
  project. Module1 is created by default.

3. On the Project menu, select Project1 Properties to display the Project
  Properties dialog box. Select the General tab and change the Startup Object
  to Sub Main.

4. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Module1:

  Option Explicit
  ' define structure of a variable-length record
  Type Person_VariableLength
      ID               As Integer
      MonthlySalary    As Currency
      LastReviewDate   As Long
      FirstName        As String
      LastName         As String
      Title            As String
      ReviewComments   As String
  End Type

  ' define structure of a fixed-length record
  Type Person_FixedLength
      ID               As Integer
      MonthlySalary    As Currency
      LastReviewDate   As Long
      FirstName        As String * 15
      LastName         As String * 15
      Title            As String * 15
      ReviewComments   As String * 150
  End Type

  ' variables for sample data
  Private binSampleOne As Person_VariableLength
  Private binSampleTwo As Person_VariableLength
  Private randomSampleOne As Person_FixedLength
  Private randomSampleTwo As Person_FixedLength

  ' record number for use with random (fixed-length) file
  Private intRecNum As Integer

  Public Sub main()
      buildSampleRecords
      demonstrateBinary
      demonstrateRandom
  End Sub

  Private Function demonstrateBinary()
      ' open the file and write the records
      Open "c:\BINsample" For Binary As #1
      Put #1, , binSampleOne
      Put #1, , binSampleTwo
      Close #1
      
      ' open the file and read the records
      Open "c:\binSample" For Binary As #1
      Dim udtPerson As Person_VariableLength
      Do While Not EOF(1)
          Get #1, , udtPerson
          ' display selected values
          With udtPerson
              Debug.Print .FirstName
              Debug.Print .LastName
              Debug.Print .ReviewComments
          End With
      Loop
      Close #1
  End Function

  Private Function demonstrateRandom()
      ' open the file and write the records
      Dim recSize As Person_FixedLength
      Open "c:\Randomsample" For Random As #1 Len = Len(recSize)
      Put #1, 1, randomSampleOne
      Put #1, 2, randomSampleTwo
      Close #1
      
      'open the file and read the records
      Dim udtPerson As Person_FixedLength
      Open "c:\randomsample" For Random As #1 Len = Len(udtPerson)
      ' demonstrate random access capability by reading file backwards
      For intRecNum = 2 To 1 Step -1
          Get #1, intRecNum, udtPerson
          ' display selected values
          With udtPerson
              Debug.Print .FirstName
              Debug.Print .LastName
              Debug.Print .ReviewComments
          End With
      Next intRecNum
      Close #1
  End Function

  Private Sub buildSampleRecords()
  ' routine to build sample records
  ' note that populating the data of the User Defined Type is the
  ' same regardless of fixed or variable length members
     With binSampleOne
          .ID = 1
          .MonthlySalary = 50000
          .LastReviewDate = #2/2/2000#
          .FirstName = "Wilma"
          .LastName = "Flintstone"
          .Title = "Movie Star"
          .ReviewComments = "Contract renewed for sequel"
      End With
      With binSampleTwo
          .ID = 2
          .MonthlySalary = 50000
          .LastReviewDate = #2/2/2000#
          .FirstName = "Fred"
          .LastName = "Flintstone"
          .Title = "Movie Star"
          .ReviewComments = "Replace with Clint Eastwood for sequel"
      End With
      With randomSampleOne
          .ID = 1
          .MonthlySalary = 50000
          .LastReviewDate = #2/2/2000#
          .FirstName = "Wilma"
          .LastName = "Flintstone"
          .Title = "Movie Star"
          .ReviewComments = "Contract renewed for sequel"
      End With
      With randomSampleTwo
          .ID = 2
          .MonthlySalary = 50000
          .LastReviewDate = #2/2/2000#
          .FirstName = "Fred"
          .LastName = "Flintstone"
          .Title = "Movie Star"
          .ReviewComments = "Replace with Clint Eastwood for sequel"
      End With
  End Sub

5. Make sure that the Immediate Window is displayed. If it is not, you need to
  select it from the View menu.

6. Run the project, and note that the results are displayed in the Immediate
  Window.
