-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
- MSPRESS Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit Part 2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install the InterOrg directory synchronization tool from the BackOffice
Resource Kit, Second Edition, the installation may not work and the following
error message may be displayed:

  Exchange service account
  Please logon using the Windows NT Exchange service account.

This error message may be displayed even if you are logged on to the domain with
the Exchange Server service account.

CAUSE
=====

If you are logged on to the domain with the Exchange Server service account,
this problem can occur because the case of the letters in the service account
user name was changed after Exchange Server was installed.

To determine if the service account user name was changed after Exchange Server
was installed:

1. Start User Manager for Domains.

2. Locate the service account, and then double-click it.

3. Locate the user name and note the case of each letter.

4. Click Cancel.

5. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

6. Locate the ObjectName value under the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeSA

7. Compare the case of the ObjectName value with the case of the service account
  user name in User Manager for Domains.

If the cases of the service account user name and the ObjectName value differ,
the OrgInstall.exe program does not recognize that you are logged on to the
domain with the service account. Perform the steps in the "Resolution" section
of this article to resolve the problem.

If the case of the service account user name and the ObjectName value are the
same, you are not experiencing the problem that this article deals with.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the case of the service account user name differs between User Manager for
Domains and the ObjectName value in the registry, edit the service account user
name to change its case to resolve this problem.

IMPORTANT: To change the case of the service account user name, you need to edit
it in the registry. It is very important that the actual spelling of the service
account user name remains exactly the same.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the ObjectName value under the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeSA

3. Click to select the ObjectName value.

4. On the Edit menu, click String, retype the service account user name in the
  same case in which it is displayed in User Manager for Domains, and then
  click OK.

5. Start the OrgInstall.exe program.

After you perform these steps, the OrgInstall.exe program should properly detect
that you are logged on to the domain with the Exchange Server service account.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The InterOrg Synchronization tool allows multiple Exchange Server organizations
to synchronize the contents of their directories.

The InterOrg Synchronization tool is available in the Microsoft BackOffice
Resource Kit, Second Edition. Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS) will use
commercially reasonable efforts in addressing all support problems. Please do
not confuse the InterOrg Synchronization tool with the InterOrg Replication
utility for public folders, which is available on the Exchange Server version
5.5 Service Pack 2 compact disc.

When you install the InterOrg Synchronization tool, the installation process
verifies that you are logged on to the domain with the Exchange Server service
account. Normally user names are not case sensitive. However, when this
comparison is made, it is case sensitive, and the installation does not work if
the case of the two values differs.
