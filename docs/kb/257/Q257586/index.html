SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the client authentication process during the Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL) handshake.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SSL-enabled servers can be configured to require client authentication, or
cryptographic validation by the server of the client's identity. When a server
that is configured this way requests client authentication, the client sends the
server both a certificate and a separate piece of digitally signed data to
authenticate itself. The server uses the digitally signed data to validate the
public key in the certificate and to authenticate the identity that the
certificate claims to represent.

The SSL protocol requires the client to create a digital signature by creating a
one-way hash from data that is generated randomly during the handshake and that
is known only to the client and server. The hash of the data is then encrypted
with the private key that corresponds to the public key in the certificate that
is being presented to the server.

An SSL-enabled server goes through the following steps to authenticate a user's
identity:

1. Does the user's public key validate the user's digital signature?

The server checks whether the user's digital signature can be validated with the
public key in the certificate. If so, the server has established that the public
key asserted to belong to the user matches the private key that is used to
create the signature and that the data has not been tampered with since it was
signed.

At this point, however, the binding between the public key and the Distinguished
Name (DN) that is specified in the certificate has not yet been established. The
certificate might have been created by someone attempting to impersonate the
user. To validate the binding between the public key and the DN, the server must
also complete step 3 and step 4.

2. Is today's date within the validity period?

The server checks the certificate's validity period. If the current date and time
are outside of that range, the authentication process does not go any further.
If the current date and time are within the certificate's validity period, the
server goes on to Step 3.

3. Is the issuing Certificate Authority (CA) a trusted CA?

Each SSL-enabled server maintains a list of trusted CA certificates. This list
determines which certificates the server will accept. If the DN of the issuing
CA matches the DN of a CA on the server's list of trusted CAs, the answer to
this question is yes, and the server goes on to Step 4. If the issuing CA is not
on the list, the client is not authenticated unless the server can verify a
certificate chain ending in a CA that is on the list. Administrators can control
which certificates are trusted or not trusted within their organizations by
controlling the lists of CA certificates that are maintained by clients and
servers.

4. Does the issuing CA's public key validate the issuer's digital signature?

The server uses the public key from the CA's certificate (which it found in its
list of trusted CAs in step 3) to validate the CA's digital signature on the
certificate that is being presented. If the information in the certificate has
changed since it was signed by the CA, or if the public key in the CA
certificate does not correspond to the private key that was used by the CA to
sign the certificate, the server does not authenticate the user's identity. If
the CA's digital signature can be validated, the server treats the user's
certificate as a valid "letter of introduction" from that CA and proceeds. At
this point, the SSL protocol allows the server to consider the client
authenticated and proceed with the connection in the next step.

5. Is the authenticated client authorized to access the requested resources?

The server checks what resources the client is permitted to access according to
the server's access control lists (ACLs) and establishes a connection with
appropriate access. If the server does not get to step 5 for any reason, the
user that is identified by the certificate cannot be authenticated, and the user
is not allowed to access any server resources that require authentication.
