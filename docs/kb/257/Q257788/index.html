The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0

SYMPTOMS
========

Navigating through a DataGrid control by using the Row Selector fails to submit
pending changes to the underlying data source.

RESOLUTION
==========

This behavior no longer occurs with the version of the DataGrid that is included
with the latest service pack for Visual Basic 6.0.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a bug in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in the latest
service pack for Visual Studio 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A Row Selector is the rectangle to the left of each row of a DataGrid. When it
is clicked, the Row Selector selects an entire row of the DataGrid. You may
navigate through the DataGrid by clicking on different Row Selectors in
sequence.

Navigating through the DataGrid using Row Selectors fails to submit pending
changes to the underlying data source, regardless of the backend database used
to populate the grid. The example below demonstrates the behavior against a Jet
Database.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In Visual Basic, open a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is added to the
  project by default.

2. From the Project menu, click to select Components. From the list of available
  components, select Microsoft ADO Data Control 6.0(OLEDB) and Microsoft
  DataGrid Control 6.0(OLEDB).

3. Place an ADO Data Control, a DataGrid, and a TextBox control onto Form1.

4. Set the ConnectionString property of the ADO Data Control to connect to the
  Nwind database that comes with Visual Basic. Connect using the Microsoft Jet
  4.0 OLE DB Provider.

5. The ConnectionString property of the ADO Data Control should look like the
  following:

Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=C:\Program Files\Microsoft
Visual Studio\VB98\NWIND.MDB;Persist Security Info=False

6. Set the RecordSource property of the ADO Data Control to Select * From
  Customers.

  Set the DataSource property of the DataGrid to ADODC1 (the ADO Data Control).

  Set the DataSource property of the TextBox to ADODC1.

  Set the DataField property of the TextBox to CompanyName.

7. Run the program.

8. Select the fourth row of data by using the DataGrid's Row Selector.

9. Edit the contents of the field in the TextBox. Without clicking other areas
  of the grid, navigate to the sixth row of the DataGrid by clicking on the Row
  Selector button for the sixth row.

10. Edit the contents of the field in the TextBox. Click on the Next button of
  the ADO Data Control to navigate to the next row.

11. Stop the application.

12. Run the application again to inspect the data, and note that when the ADO
  Data Control was used to navigate through the DataGrid, the change was
  submitted.

  However, when the Row Selector was used to navigate through the DataGrid, the
  change was not submitted.
