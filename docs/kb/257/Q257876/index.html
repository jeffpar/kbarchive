The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article demonstrates one way to print a log or other simple document from
an Exchange Server event script. This example uses a COM object to implement the
printing functionality by way of the Print Object. In addition, the account
under which the Exchange Event Service runs must have a default printer
installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

On the Exchange Server, the Exchange Event Service runs under a specific
account, usually the Exchange Service Account. In order for printing to succeed
from an event script, the account requires a default printer in its registry
hive.

1. In Control Panel, open the Services applet, select the Microsoft Exchange
  Event Service, and then open the Startup dialog box. Note which account the
  service runs under.

2. Open User Manager (Programs/Administrative Tools (Common)/User Manager for
  Domains). View the domain in which the Exchange server resides. Add the
  account noted in step 1 to either the Administrators group or the Power Users
  group.

3. Log on to the Exchange Server as the account noted in step 1. Add a printer
  to the system and make it the default printer.

4. Log on to a client computer as a user that has permissions to create an event
  script and add the following code to a Microsoft Exchange 5.5 public folder:

  &lt;SCRIPT RunAt=Server Language=VBScript&gt;

  Option Explicit 

  ' DESCRIPTION: This event is fired when a new message is added to the folder.
  Public Sub Folder_OnMessageCreated

     script.response = "Message Created -"
     PrintScript
     script.response = script.response &amp; "- Finished"

  End Sub

  Sub PrintScript

     Dim objprint

     Set objprint = CreateObject("PrintMsgProj.PrintMsgCls")
     objprint.PrintMsg

  End Sub
  &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;

5. Create an ActiveX DLL which uses the Print object to print a text string:

  a. Start a new project in Microsoft Visual Basic and select ActiveX DLL.
     Class1 is created by default; change the name to "PrintMsgCls".

  b. From the Visual Basic Project menu, select Project1 Properties. Change the
     Project name to "PrintMsgProj" and the Project Description to "Print EV
     Script Test Object". Click OK to close the Project Properties dialog box.

the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  MTS, or COM+

6. Paste the following code into the General Declarations section of
  PrintMsgCls:

  Public Sub PrintMsg()

  Printer.Print "The OnMessageCreated Event Has Fired!"
  Printer.EndDoc

  End Sub

7. Save the project. From the File menu, click Make PrintMsgProj.dll. You are
  now finished creating your ActiveX DLL project, but you still need to test
  it.

8. Create a Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) package. For additional
  information, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q223406 HOWTO: Create an Empty MTS Package to Add Components for ASP

9. Test the script. If nothing prints, check the script log for error
  information.
