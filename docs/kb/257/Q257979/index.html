The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

Exchange Server 5.5 can automatically dequeue e-mail messages from a provider's
server. This option is used in environments where the Exchange Server computer
does not have a continuous connection to the Internet, and a provider "hosts"
the domain the Exchange Server computer uses. Typically, Exchange Server 5.5
issues the ETRN command to the server to initiate this transfer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some providers do not support ETRN or cannot provide a static Internet Protocol
(IP) address for hosted customers, and instead support the issuing of the TURN
or ATRN command. You can configure Exchange Server 5.5 to issue this command
sequence rather than ETRN if necessary. This option is also useful when a proxy
server, Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) server, or a demand-dial router
performs the dial-up connection to the Internet and is assigned a dynamic IP
address. The TURN client functionality enables servers that receive a dynamic IP
address assignment from an Internet service provider (ISP) to retrieve e-mail
messages from an Internet-based e-mail server that queues e-mail messages for
TURN.

To configure the Exchange Server computer to issue the TURN command rather than
the ETRN command sequence, use the following steps.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor.

2. Locate the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Service\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters

3. Add a DWORD value named AlwaysUseTURN, and then set the value to 0x1.

4. Using the Exchange Administrator program, go to Internet Mail Service in the
  Connections Container, and then double-click the object to view its
  properties.

5. On the Security tab, click the Edit button for the domain.

6. Click "SASL/SSL security".

7. Click SASL/AUTH, and then click Change.

8. Type the authorization credentials (user name and password) necessary to log
  on to the remote computer.

  NOTE: If you are connecting to a Microsoft Windows domain, be sure to include
  the domain (for example, domain\user_account).

9. Stop and restart Internet Mail Service for the changes to take effect.

You can use the following sample script with the Windows Script Host that will
make the registry change.

  L_Welcome_MsgBox_Message_Text   = "This script adds the AlwaysUseTURN value to the Internet Mail Service that enables LAN based TURN."
  L_Welcome_MsgBox_Title_Text     = "Enabling TURN"
  Call Welcome()

  Dim WSHShell
  Set WSHShell = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
  WSHShell.Popup "Set value  HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters\AlwaysUseTURN to  REG_DWORD 1"
  WSHShell.RegWrite  "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters\AlwaysUseTURN" , 1,  "REG_DWORD"

  Sub Welcome()
      Dim intDoIt

      intDoIt =  MsgBox(L_Welcome_MsgBox_Message_Text,    _   
                        vbOKCancel + vbInformation,       _
                        L_Welcome_MsgBox_Title_Text )
      If intDoIt = vbCancel Then
          WScript.Quit
      End If
  End Sub
