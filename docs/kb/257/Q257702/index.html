-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Custom properties added to a form or class should display a value of nothing
(None) in the design interface. Instead, there is a heavy bar character followed
by some text. This text usually consists of the name of another of the form or
class object's properties.

CAUSE
=====

Within the "properties" field of the form's .scx file, or the visual class
library's .vcx file, there is no trailing space following the equal sign (=) in
the property's declaration statement. The form or class files are generated by
the Documenting Wizard of any Microsoft Visual FoxPro version prior to Visual
FoxPro 6.0 in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3.


RESOLUTION
==========

It most cases, the problem can be fixed by using the form or class library file
as a table and issuing a REPLACE statement as follows. For example, if the
problem exists in a form named Form1, perform the following:

  USE form1.scx
  REPLACE properties WITH STRTRAN(properties,"="+CHR(13),"= "+CHR(13))

This can also be repaired by running the Documenting Wizard shipped with Visual
Studio Service Pack 3. The generated code has the necessary space after the
equal sign for customer properties where the value is nothing.

NOTE: Always save backup copies of your project code before processing it through
the Documenting Wizard.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a bug in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in the latest
service pack for Visual Studio 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual FoxPro 6.0 processes forms and classes differently than previous versions
of the product. As a result, the absence of the space after the equal sign (for
a property with a value of nothing) did not result in a problem in those
previous versions of the product. However, if such class or form code is ported
over to Visual FoxPro 6.0, it will be problematic at design time and run time.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new form, and add a property called "myproperty" (without the
  quotation marks).

2. Blank out the logical value, such that the property's value appears as
  (None).

3. Close and save the form as "test" (without the quotation marks).

4. Use the form as a table by typing the following into the Command window:

"USE test.scx" (without the quotation marks)

5. Browse the .scx file, go to the third record, and then open the memo field
  named Properties.

6. Remove the space after the equal sign in the line that reads myproperty = .

7. Close the .scx table and open the form test in the design interface.

8. Go to the bottom of the Properties sheet (on the All page) and note that the
  value of myproperty displays a heavy bar character, followed by Name =
  "Form1".
