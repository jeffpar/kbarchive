SYMPTOMS
========

When a client loads a modal form from an ActiveX EXE server and leaves it up for
an extended period of time, the server may experience a severe resource leak
under Microsoft Windows 95 and Microsoft Windows 98. This behavior happens even
without any user interaction with the application. If you close the modal form
to shut down the server, the resource recovers. The resource loss does not occur
with a non-modal form.

CAUSE
=====

The client application is in a frozen state waiting for the modal form to go
away. During this time the message queue fills up and, therefore, system
resources are lowered.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a bug in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in the latest
service pack for Visual Studio 6.0.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new ActiveX EXE project and rename it to ModalSvr. Class1 is created
  by default.

2. Paste the following code in Class1:

  Public Sub ShowForm()
      Form1.Show vbModal
  End Sub

3. From the Project menu, add a new form, Form1.

4. Save and compile the project. ModalSvr.exe is made and registered on the
  computer.

5. Create a new Standard EXE project as the client. Form1 is created by default.

6. Add one TextBox and one CommandButton to Form1.

7. Paste the following code to the code window of Form1:

  Dim obj As Object
  Private Sub Command1_Click()
      Set obj = CreateObject("ModalSvr.Class1")
      obj.ShowForm
      Set obj = Nothing
  End Sub

  Private Sub Form_Load()
      Text1.Text = ""
  End Sub

  Private Sub Text1_KeyDown(KeyCode As Integer, Shift As Integer)
      If Not ((KeyCode = vbKeyF4) And (Shift = vbAltMask)) Then
         Command1_Click
      End If
  End Sub

8. On the Start menu, choose Programs, choose Accessories, choose System Tools,
  and then choose Resource Meter. If Resource Meter is not available, on the
  Start menu, choose Control Panel, choose Add/Remove Programs, and then choose
  the Windows Setup tab to add it.

9. Press the F5 key to run the client. Click on the TextBox and press the F4 key
  to launch the server and its modal form.

10. Watch the Resource Meter and note that the System and User resources
  gradually go down. Closing the modal form to shut down the server recovers
  the resources. If you use the KeyUp event or click Command1 to launch the
  modal form, the leak is not as severe.
