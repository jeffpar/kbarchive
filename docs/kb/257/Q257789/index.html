SYMPTOMS
========

A Visual Basic 6.0 Standard EXE project contains several data-bound UserControls
of the same type on a form. One property of the UserControl is bound to an OLE
DB Simple data source at run-time after the form is loaded. The bindings are
added by looping through the Form.Controls collection. The property attribute is
set to "immediate update" at UserControl design time.

In the Visual Basic integrated development environment (IDE), changes to the
bound properties are correctly reflected back to the underlying data source as
soon as the PropertyChanged method is called.

However, when you run the compiled EXE, the underlying data source of the control
is only updated when the control focus is moved to any other control on the
form.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, install the latest service pack for Visual Studio 6.0.
