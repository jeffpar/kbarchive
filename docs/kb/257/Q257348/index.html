The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

During periods of high server use, the following error messages may be logged in
the application event log:

  Source: MSExchangeMTA
  2026 - An internal MTA error occurred. Contact Microsoft Product
  Support Services. Unable to write to the message tracking log, error
  1%.

  Source: MSExchangeIMC
  3016 - An error occurred while logging a message tracking record. This
  will not affect message delivery. Verify that message tracking is
  configured correctly.

Mail flow is not affected by these messages.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when the system attendant writes to the message tracking
log (located in the Tracking.log folder under Exchsrvr). When the message
transfer agent (MTA), Internet Mail Service, or other service sends these
messages to the system attendant, the system attendant holds the messages in a
buffer and only writes to the log if a number of messages that is specified in
the registry (the LogFlushFreq registry value) is reached. The system attendant
spends less time waiting for disk input/output to finish if you increase this
buffer, which reduces or eliminates the 2026 and 3016 event IDs.

The default value of the LogFlushFreq registry value is 0x10 hexadecimal (16
decimal).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, increase this buffer by changing the LogFlushFreq
registry value:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the LogFlushFreq value under the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MsExchangeSA\Parameters

3. On the Edit menu, click DWORD, type "100" (without the quotation marks), and
  then click OK.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

Stop and restart all of the Exchange Server services so that this change takes
effect.
