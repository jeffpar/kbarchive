-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a long path or file name (more than 260 characters) is used in the
&lt;!--#include virtual | file ="filename"--&gt; directive in an ASP page, IIS
generates an Access Violation error message.

CAUSE
=====

The buffer allocated for the file name is 260 characters long. Therefore, a file
name that is more than 260 characters causes a buffer overflow and an Access
Violation error message to occur.
