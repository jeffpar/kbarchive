-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a package is distributed that requires the running of multiple programs
(for example, Microsoft Setup Toolkit) and the use of mapped drives, the setup
process may not be completed as expected because the drive mapping is removed
after the first program has completed running. Under this scenario, the initial
setup executable file appears to start other subsequent setup programs, but the
process is ultimately unsuccessful.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because Advertised Programs Manager (APM) disconnects the
installation drive after the initial package command has completed running. If
the initial setup command starts another program to complete the installation of
the package, the second program no longer has access to the network location
through a drive letter.

APM indicates that the running of the package was successful, therefore it
terminates and no error is recorded in the logs.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, use a wrapper program such as SMS Installer. A
wrapper can be used to script the running of the software or to copy the
software locally before proceeding with installation. Note that not all wrapper
programs are suitable for all situations.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems Management
Server version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The 32-bit clients may exhibit this behavior only if the package requires a
drive letter. Thirty-two-bit advertisements have the option of installing from
Universal Naming Convention (UNC) connections, which do not require a drive
letter.

For 16-bit clients, APM16 always creates a drive mapping.

SMS Installer can be found on the SMS 2.0 compact disc in the Smssetup\Sms_inst
folder. For more information about using SMS Installer, refer to online Help,
installed with SMS Installer.
