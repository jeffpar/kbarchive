SYMPTOMS
========

When a client with non-administrator rights is assigned to a second site, the
client does not create a Client Configuration Request file (.ccr) targeted to
the second site. The client is unable to add additional components or set the
second site as its primary site.

CAUSE
=====

If you have one site assigned, and then a user with non-administrator rights
requires another site, the second site's configuration data is incompletely
processed because the logged-on user does not have sufficient rights to
manipulate the registry.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, wait for the Client Component Installation Manager
(CCIM) to run and reset the registry permissions. After it does so, you are able
to log on again (as a user with non-administrator rights) and configure the
second site's information. Run CCIM again (using Setevnt or by waiting for it to
wake up), and the site is updated for the client.
