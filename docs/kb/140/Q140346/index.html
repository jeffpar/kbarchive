-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual C++, versions 1.5, 1.51, 1.52, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

OLE controls can be registered by using Visual C++ from the Tools menu, from the
Test Container provided with the Control Development Kit (CDK), or by using the
regsvr or regsvr32 applications provided with Visual C++. In some cases, the
registration of a control may fail; use this article to help troubleshoot the
problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

All of the previously mentioned methods for registering an OLE Control use
essentially the same technique. LoadLibrary() is called to load the control into
memory, GetProcAddress() is called to get the address of the DllRegisterServer()
function, and then DllRegisterServer() is called to register the control.

Reasons Why the Registration of a Control May Fail
--------------------------------------------------

- One or more of the necessary OLE DLLs is not in the path. Instructions for
  distributing OLE Controls as well as an explanation of what DLLs are
  necessary to ship can be found in the Shipctrl.wri file located in the same
  directory as the CDK.

- The control is loading a DLL other than the OLE DLL, and that DLL is not in
  the path. When the control is loaded into memory, any DLLs that are
  implicitly loaded through an import library are also loaded. If any of these
  DLLs are not in the path, the control is not loaded successfully, so
  registration fails.

- One or more DLLs may be the wrong version. If the control was built with a
  newer version of a DLL than the one installed on the computer, the control
  may not load properly, so registration fails.

- An old version of Ocd25.lib is being linked to. If the control is using the
  MFC database classes, there may be a problem with the version of the
  Ocd25.lib file that is being linked to.

- The OLE control is located on a Novell server's remote drive. In this case,
  the access rights to the .ocx file may be preventing the control from
  loading. Make sure that the access rights for the .ocx file are set to
  read-only, shareable access, which is the typical setting for executable
  files.

Troubleshooting Techniques
--------------------------

If none of the possible causes are true in your case, try the following
techniques.

1. With the control project loaded in Visual C++, set the executable for the
  debug session to the OLE Control Test Container (Tstcon16.exe or
  Tstcon32.exe). When you start the Test Container (under the debugger), you
  will get a warning that the Test Container does not contain debug
  information. Ignore this and proceed.

2. From the Test Container, attempt to register the control. Watch for debug
  output from the OLE Control DLL or any of its dependent DLLs. If you are
  running the 16-bit product, remember to run the DBWIN program to receive
  debug output.

  For information on how to set the executable for a DLL debug session, please
  see the help topic "Debugging DLLs" in Books Online.

As an alternative, you can attempt to register the control programmatically.
First create an MFC AppWizard application selecting Dialog-based application and
OLE Automation. Enabling OLE Automation will initialize OLE so that the code to
register the control will work properly. In the CWinApp-derived class, you will
find the function InitInstance() with the initial code as follows:

  BOOL CTestregApp::InitInstance()
  {

     // Initialize OLE libraries
     if (!AfxOleInit())
     {
        AfxMessageBox(IDP_OLE_INIT_FAILED);
        return FALSE;
     }

At this point, add the following code segment, which will allow you to check the
return codes from LoadLibrary(), GetProcAddress(), and DllRegisterServer.

  #ifdef _WIN32
      HINSTANCE hDLL = LoadLibrary("some.ocx");
      if(NULL == hDLL)
      {
          // See Winerror.h for explaination of error code.
          DWORD error = GetLastError();
          TRACE1("LoadLibrary() Failed with: %i\n", error);
          return FALSE;
      }

      typedef HRESULT (CALLBACK *HCRET)(void);
      HCRET lpfnDllRegisterServer;

      lpfnDllRegisterServer =
              (HCRET)GetProcAddress(hDLL, "DllRegisterServer");
      if(NULL == lpfnDllRegisterServer)
      {
          // See Winerror.h for explaination of error code.
          DWORD error = GetLastError();
          TRACE1("GetProcAddress() Failed with %i\n", error);
          return FALSE;
      }

      if(FAILED((*lpfnDllRegisterServer)()))
      {
          TRACE("DLLRegisterServer() Failed");
          return FALSE;
      }

  #else // 16-bit
      HINSTANCE hDLL = LoadLibrary("regtest.ocx");
      if(HINSTANCE_ERROR &gt; hDLL)
      {
          // See LoadLibrary() help for explaination of error code.
          TRACE1("LoadLibrary() Failed with: %i\n", hDLL);
          return FALSE;
      }

      typedef HRESULT (CALLBACK *HCRET)(void);
      HCRET lpfnDllRegisterServer;

      lpfnDllRegisterServer =
              (HCRET)GetProcAddress(hDLL, "DllRegisterServer");
      if(NULL == lpfnDllRegisterServer)
      {
          // See GetProcAddress() help for explaination of error code.
          TRACE("GetProcAddress() Failed");
          return FALSE;
      }

      if(FAILED((*lpfnDllRegisterServer)()))
      {
          TRACE("DLLRegisterServer() Failed");
          return FALSE;
      }
  #endif
