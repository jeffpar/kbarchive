-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Multitasking MTA for Windows NT, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Windows NT Multitasking MMTA (NT MMTA) Dispatch or External instance is
running, Control Panel, Services shows the instance as started and mail is being
moved, or Performance Monitor (PerfMon) shows the appropriate number of OS/2
processes active.

However, when you start a Monitor for the instance from the Mail Service Manager,
you will get an MS-DOS box that flashes open and closes. In addition, when you
start a Monitor for the instance from the Command window, you will get the
following error message:

  Error: Service instance not found. Service may not be running.

CAUSE
=====

The NT MMTA instance was previously stopped while a Monitor was connected to it.
The instance was restarted while the Monitor was still open. The running Monitor
did not connect to the restarted NT MMTA instance (expected behavior), and the
Monitor was closed.

All subsequent tries to start a Monitor for the restarted NT MMTA instance will
fail with the symptoms given above.

RESOLUTION
==========

Stop the problem NT MMTA instance, and start it again. Then start a Monitor for
the instance; the Monitor should start successfully and connect to the NT MMTA
instance.

In the future, if an NT MMTA instance has a Monitor running, make sure the
Monitor is stopped when the instance is stopped.
