   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows 3.x SNA Client Setup will fail on Windows 95 with the following
error if an Autoexec.bat file is not present:

  Setup is unable to detect any network on this computer. Please install a
  network and try Setup again later.

The same error occurs when running Setup on a client that was previously
installed if the Autoexec.bat has been removed from the system.

For information on other causes of this error message, please refer to the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q128118 SNA Server Win3.x Client Setup Err Msg: No Windows network...

CAUSE
=====

Setup was treating the non-existence of AUTOEXEC.BAT as an error, and returning
early from the SNAValidate function before attempting to figure out which
network protocols are installed.

While investigating this problem, another problem was discovered. If there's no
AUTOEXEC.BAT found when Setup starts, Setup tries to create one while modifying
the system files, and writes just one line to the new AUTOEXEC.BAT: "PATH
C:\SNA.WIN;".

The next time Setup is run, it finds AUTOEXEC.BAT, but on its way out Setup
changes the line to "PATHC:\SNA.WIN;". The next time Setup runs, it doesn't
recognize the path line, so it adds another one like the first time. This
process is repeated each time Setup is executed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has updated the file, WIN16CL.DLL, to correct this problem. The
Windows 3.x SNA Client Setup program now continues on with the SNAValidate
function if the AUTOEXEC.BAT does not exist. In addition, the Setup program
correctly writes the PATH statement.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, add an AUTOEXEC.BAT to the system where the client
is being installed. The AUTOEXEC.BAT does not need to contain any specific
commands; it just needs to exist on the system.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
