SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Send command in a MAPI-aware program to send a fax with
Microsoft Exchange, you may receive one of the following error messages:

- Word couldn't send mail because of MAPI failure: (0x00000002/0x00000000).

- The item could not be sent. A default set of folders could not be found. Your
  active profile must include such a set, such as a personal folder file.
  Microsoft Exchange Client - 9995 - [8100270B]

When you try to send a fax by printing to the Microsoft Fax service from a
MAPI-aware program, you may receive the following error message:

  General Error!

CAUSE
=====

These errors occur when the Microsoft Exchange profile you are using to send
faxes is not configured properly. To send faxes using Microsoft Fax, your
profile must include the following information services:

- Microsoft Fax

- Personal Address Book

- Personal Folders

A "General Error!" message can occur when the Subject field in any cover page,
including custom cover pages, includes text.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, use the appropriate method:

Method 1
--------

Make sure the correct information services are included in your Microsoft
Exchange profile. To do so, follow these steps:

1. If Microsoft Exchange is running, click Exit And Log Off on the File menu.

2. In Control Panel, double-click the Mail And Fax icon.

3. Click Show Profiles, click the profile you want to use to send faxes, and
  then click Properties.

4. Click the Services tab.

5. If the Personal Address Book service is not listed in the "The following
  information services are set up in this profile" box, click Add, click
  Personal Address Book, click OK, and then click OK.

6. If the Personal Folders service or a Personal Information Store is not listed
  in the "The following information services are set up in this profile" box,
  click Add, click Personal Folders, click OK, type a name for the personal
  folders, click Open, and then click OK.

7. Click OK, and then click Close.

Method 2
--------

To prevent "General Error!" messages, leave the Subject line in the fax blank.

Method 3
--------

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
  Add\Remove Programs.

2. Click the Windows Setup tab and then click the Microsoft Exchange (or Windows
  Messaging) check box to clear it. If you are prompted to remove Microsoft Fax
  also, do so.

3. Click Accessories, and then click Details.

4. Click the Wordpad check box to clear it, click OK and then click OK again.

5. Restart Windows 95, press the F8 key when you see the "Starting Windows 95"
  message, and then choose Safe Mode Command Prompt Only from the Startup menu.

6. At the command prompt, type the following commands. Press ENTER after each
  line.

  " cd\windows
  deltree forms " (without the quotation marks)

  When you are prompted to delete the folder, press Y.

7. Restart Windows 95 normally.

8. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
  Add\Remove Programs.

9. Click the Windows Setup tab, click the Microsoft Exchange (or Windows
  Messaging) check box to select it, and then click the Microsoft Fax check box
  to select it.

10. Click Accessories, and then click Details.

11. Click the Wordpad check box to select it, click OK and then click OK again.
  Restart your computer when you are prompted.

12. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click Windows Explorer.

13. Verify that your computer is configured to view hidden files. For
  information about how to view hidden files, please see the following article
  in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q141276 How to View System and Hidden Files in Windows 95

14. Verify the following files exist in the c:\Programs Files\Exchange folder:

  Mlset32.exe
  Mlshext.dll

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Personal Folders information service contains your mail folders (in a .pst
file). When you send a fax, the Personal Folders service is required for the
following reasons:

- The .pst file is used as a temporary store while you are composing a fax.
  When you send the fax, it is stored in the Outbox mail folder until it is
  sent, and it is stored in the Sent Items folder after it is sent.

- If there is a problem sending the fax, a mail message from the System
  Administrator describing the problem is delivered to the Inbox folder.

Notes
-----

- Note that similar problems can also occur after you install Windows
  Messaging. To resolve this issue, uninstall Windows Messaging and use the
  Microsoft Exchange client instead. This should allow you to send faxes with
  text in the Subject line.

- A similar problem can also occur if the computer name contains the "@"
  character (and possibly other special characters). To check the computer
  name, double-click Network in Control Panel, and then click the
  Identification tab.
