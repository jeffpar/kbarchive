-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When Windows 3.0 is set up on a network workstation via the SETUP /N command, a
Windows Setup Hardware List appears with a Display option.

If some of these workstations have Super VGA cards (SVGA) that can deliver 800 x
600 or 1024 x 768 resolutions, then it is possible to add the proper
manufacturers' software driver as an option to the Hardware List by editing the
SETUP.INF before running SETUP /N on the individual workstations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use the following outline to add additional video display driver Options via the
SETUP.INF file.

1. Copy the display drivers for the video card into the shared Windows
  directory. Make sure that none of the files replace existing Windows files.

2. Edit SETUP.INF with a standard ASCII text editor and locate the lines:

        [display]
        ;profile=driver, description of driver, resolution, 286 grabber,
        logo code, VDD, 386grabber, ega.sys, logo data

3. Add a new line to this section of the SETUP.INF following the format above
  exactly. Use the entry for Windows standard VGA as a reference point and
  substitute the new .DRV, .GR3, or VDD file names as supplied by the
  manufacturer.

For example, if the custom video driver you received for your Paradise video card
came with two files, PVGA800.DRV (a 800 x 600 driver) and VPVGA.GR3, then you
would add a new line under [DISPLAY] for the new video driver and resolution.
Copy the line for the standard "VGA" driver line exactly (commas and quotation
marks are IMPORTANT), but change the profile, driver, description of driver, and
386grabber to match the new driver. If you want to use the larger 8514 fonts,
you may also want to change the resolution option from "100,96,96" to
"100,120,120":

Example

     P800VGA=7:PVGA800.DRV, "Paradise 800x600 16 Color",
     "100,120,120", 3:vgacolor.gr2, 2:vgalogo.lgo, x:*vddvga,
     7:vpvga.gr3,, 2:vgalogo.rle

DEFINITIONS OF 10 SETTINGS
--------------------------

Setting        Definition
-------        ----------

profile        Short driver name

driver         Name of the driver (that is, PVGA800.DRV)

driver         Name that the Windows Setup program shows
description

resolution     What font set to use:

                "100,120,120" = 8514 fonts.
                "100,96,96" = VGA fonts.
                "133,96,72" = EGA and Hercules fonts.
                "200,96,48" = CGA fonts.

286 grabber   Screen grabber for old applications in
             a real and standard modes

logo code     Startup logo to use

vdd           Virtual display driver - video display
             for virtual machines in 386 enhanced mode

386grabber    Screen grabber for old applications in
             enhanced mode.

ega.sys       Where to find EGA.SYS if needed

logo data     Logo information to be bound into WIN.COM

The SETUP.INF file is a comma delineated text file formatted for 160 columns that
supplies customized directions to the SETUP.EXE.

Preferred Workstation Setup Method
----------------------------------

Install Windows 3.0 on a network (see pages 543-556 of the "Microsoft Windows
User's Guide"), and then run the SETUP /N command on each workstation. In some
instances (for example, large workstation groups) it may not be efficient to do
this and then customize each workstation individually. By editing the SETUP.INF
file with a text editor, it is possible to enhance the SETUP /N command so that
it customizes each workstation to a company standard.
