The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When Microsoft Windows 3.0 is set up on a network workstation via the SETUP /N
command, there are nine possible choices for pointing devices. It is possible to
add additional pointing device drivers for touch screens, digitizing tablets,
and trackballs by editing the SETUP.INF before running SETUP /N on the
individual workstations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use the following outline to add additional pointing device drivers via the
SETUP.INF file.

1. Copy the appropriate Windows 3.00 device drivers into the shared Windows
  directory.

2. Edit the SETUP.INF file with a standard ASCII text editor and locate the
  pointing.device section:

     [pointing.device]

     Identifier=x:drivename, "Description", x:virtualdrivername,
     dosdriver

  Parameter         Description
  ----------       ------------
  &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;
  Identifier       Driver short name
  drivername       Driver filename ending in .DRV
  Description      Title of driver used at setup
  Virtualdriver    (VMD) Most pointing devices use the internal driver
                in WIN386.EXE, but the manufacturer may supply one
                that will end in .386, e.g. "1:summa.386"

  Dosdriver        Pointing device driver in the CONFIG.SYS or
                AUTOEXEC.BAT that will be replaced by new version if
                selected (for example, replace old MOUSE.SYS with new
                version)

3. Add a blank line to the end of this section, and, on it, enter the additional
  driver.

Example
-------

To add the following two drivers, SUMMA.DRV and SUMMA.386, add the new line as
follows:

     Summa = 1:SUMMA.DRV, "Summa IS/100", 1:SUMMA.386

The "1:" or "x:" is showing disk number, where driver is located. On network
installations this is not valid.

The SETUP.INF file is a comma-delineated text file formatted for 160 columns that
supplies customized directions to the SETUP.EXE.

Preferred Workstation Setup Method
----------------------------------

Install Windows 3.0 on a network (see pages 543-556 of the "Microsoft Windows
User's Guide"), and then run the SETUP /N command on each workstation. In some
instances (for example, large workstation groups) it may not be efficient to do
this and then customize each workstation individually. By editing the SETUP.INF
file with a text editor, it is possible to enhance the SETUP /N command so that
it customizes each workstation to a company standard.
