The following open letter describes Microsoft's telephone support
policies for Microsoft BASIC and QuickBASIC, as of February 20, 1991:

Dear Microsoft BASIC or QuickBASIC Customer:

On October 23, 1990, Microsoft announced Microsoft OnCall(TM) for
Microsoft BASIC. OnCall for BASIC offers high-level support, extended
service hours, and minimal hold time for all Microsoft BASIC products
through a 900 phone number or a flat rate added to a toll number.
Microsoft offers OnCall for BASIC in response to customer demand for
faster, more sophisticated support.

"The entry-level support line meets the requirements of most customers
who need assistance with installing Microsoft QuickBASIC software and
getting up to speed. Those who require priority support on more
advanced issues now have an additional option with Microsoft OnCall
for BASIC," said Charles Stevens, general manager of Microsoft's Data
Access Business Unit. Common questions from Microsoft OnCall for BASIC
customers include inquiries about Microsoft QuickBASIC memory
management, inter-language calling, and error and event trapping.

Microsoft OnCall for BASIC is offered through a 900 phone number at a
cost of $2.00 per minute. Hold time will be minimal and customers will
not be charged until they reach a technician. Extended service hours
are from 6 AM to 6 PM Pacific Standard Time (PST), Monday through
Friday (excluding holidays). The Microsoft OnCall for BASIC phone
number is (900) 896-9999.

In many businesses, universities, and government agencies, the phone
systems are blocked from using our 900 phone number. Therefore, you
may also access OnCall for BASIC through the following unblocking toll
number: (206) 646-5102, which is open 6 AM to 6 PM PST, Monday through
Friday (excluding holidays), with a flat-rate fee of $20.00 per call
for programming assistance. Only Master Card, VISA, and American
Express credit cards are accepted.

The entry-level phone line for Microsoft QuickBASIC supports Microsoft
QuickBASIC version 4.50 for DOS systems, and Microsoft QuickBASIC
version 1.00 for Macintosh(R) systems. Technicians will help new
Microsoft QuickBASIC users get up and running as quickly as possible.
The entry-level Microsoft QuickBASIC support number is (206) 646-5101.
Service hours are 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM PST, Monday through Friday
(excluding holidays).

Users of Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System and earlier
versions of the Microsoft BASIC compiler will continue to have
unlimited support on the Microsoft Product Support Services toll line,
which is (206) 637-7096 for Languages and Hardware. Support for all
Microsoft BASIC products will continue on CompuServe as well.
