If you receive the following error when compiling a program with C
version 6.00 or 6.00a

   fatal error C1007: unrecognized flag '-Bm' in 'p2'

it may be the result of inadvertently invoking pass 2 (C2.EXE) of an
earlier version of the compiler, such as C version 5.10. Beginning
with C version 6.00, the option -Bm is a valid flag for pass 2 of the
compiler. This was not a valid option in earlier compiler versions.

When looking for an executable file, the operating system will first
search your current directory, and then search all the directories
listed in your path. You should make sure that the C 6.00 compiler is
listed first on your path, before any other versions of the compiler.
This is especially true when running on a network because network
search paths sometimes obscure exactly what directories are being
searched for files.

If you would like to double-check which drive and directory are being
used when compiling, invoke the compiler with the /d option. This
option displays the information that is being passed to each phase of
the compiler, including the name and directory of the compiler file in
use.
