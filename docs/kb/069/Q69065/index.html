The CodeView sequential mode (/T option) is not available in CodeView
version 3.00.

In CodeView versions 2.30 and earlier, the /T option caused the
debugger to operate in "sequential mode," which means that only a
command-line interface was available. You could then type the command
"=COM1" to redirect the input and output to the COM port, which
allowed debugging via a remote terminal.

The /T option and the "=COM1" command are not available in CodeView
3.00, 3.10, and 3.11 because of the new windowing environment used in
these versions.

However, you can still redirect CodeView output to COM1 using the
Redirected Output command.

The Redirected Output command causes the CodeView debugger to write
all subsequent command output to a device, such as another terminal, a
printer, or a file. The term "output" includes not only the output
from commands but also the command characters that are echoed as you
type them.

The second greater-than symbol (optional) appends the output to an
existing file. If you redirect output to an existing file without this
symbol, the existing file will be replaced. For example:

   &gt;&gt;COM1

In the example above, output is redirected to the device designated as
COM1 (probably a remote terminal). You might want to enter this
command, for example, when you are debugging a graphics program and
want CodeView commands to be displayed on a remote terminal while the
program display appears on the originating terminal.

   &gt;&gt;OUTFILE.TXT

In the example above, output is redirected to the file OUTFILE.TXT.
This command is helpful in keeping a permanent record of a CodeView
session.
