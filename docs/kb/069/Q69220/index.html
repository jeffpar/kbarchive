-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.1 
- Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for OS/2, versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) contains three ways to run a
program:

1. You can choose Execute from the Run menu (and choose Command Line from the
  Run menu to specify the command-line arguments).

2. You can choose Run DOS Command from the Run menu.

3. You can use the key combination "Arg textarg SHIFT+F9".

However, a problem occurs if a file is redirected as input into a program that is
executed using any of the methods above. The length of the input file, from
which STDIN will receive data, will be erased and will receive a length of zero
bytes. Thus, you cannot run a program (command) from the Programmer's WorkBench
that expects STDIN to be redirected from a file. For example, if the command
"PROG &lt;INPUT.TXT" is entered under Run DOS Command from the Run menu, the
file INPUT.TXT will be erased and have a length of zero. This problem occurs
only in DOS. The OS/2 version of the Programmer's WorkBench works correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

One way to work around the problem is to create a batch file that performs the
command. Rather than running the program directly, the program can be ran in the
batch file with STDIN redirected from a file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Programmer's WorkBench
version 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Below is sample program that receives data redirected from a file, and prints it
to the screen. To demonstrate the problem, you can use the sample program and do
one of the following:

Choose Execute from the Run Menu
--------------------------------

1. Open the source file or program list of the program you want to run.

2. Enter the command line option "&lt;input.txt" (without the quotation marks)
  under Command Line in the Run menu. INPUT.TXT is the file that contains the
  input for the program.

3. Choose Execute from the Run menu.

4. View the size of the file, INPUT.TXT.

Choose Run DOS Command from the Run Menu
----------------------------------------

1. Choose Run DOS Command from the Run menu.

2. Enter "prog &lt;input.txt" (without the quotation marks) where "prog" is the
  name of the executable and INPUT.TXT is the name of the input file.

3. View the size of the file, INPUT.TXT.

Type "Arg textarg SHIFT+F9"
---------------------------

1. Press ALT+A.

2. Type in the command "prog &lt;input.txt" (without the quotation marks).

3. Press SHIFT+F9.

4. View the size of the file, INPUT.TXT.

Sample Code
-----------

  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
  void main(void)
  {
     int c;
     for (c=getchar();!feof(stdin);c=getchar())
        printf("%c",(char)c);
  }
