-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When Windows 3.0 is set up on a network workstation via the SETUP /N command, at
least three default program groups, Main, Games, and Accessories, are created.
Each of these groups have a certain number of default program items.

It is possible to have custom new groups created with selected program items or
change the contents of the default program groups by editing the SETUP.INF
before running SETUP /N on the individual workstations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use the following outline to create custom groups via the SETUP.INF file.

1. Edit SETUP.INF with a standard ASCII text editor and locate the line:

        [progman.groups]

2. Add a blank line directly under Games, and, on this line, type the name of
  the new group you want to have built:

        [progman.groups]
        Main,1
        Accessories
        Games
        MyWork

  The ",1" parameter indicates which group will be the default "open" group upon
  starting Windows.

3. Add a new section header after the listing of groups and a list of what
  program items you want to appear in this group:

        [MyWork]
        "Solitaire",   SOL.EXE
        "StyleSheet",  "NOTEPAD.EXE STYLESH.TXT"
        "GammaWrite",  GW.EXE

The new group "MyWork" will have three program items in it. "Solitaire" is the
word that appears under the icon and the executable file is SOL.EXE.
"StyleSheet" is a text file on company style that will be represented as an icon
for quick reference. The command line is in quotation marks because there is a
space between the two filenames. "GammaWrite" is a third-party utility program
item. Because it does not come with Windows, it is necessary to add GW.EXE to
the end of two other sections of the SETUP.INF, [dontfind] and [win.apps]. If
this program is not located in the shared Windows directory, supply a full path
description to the executable file.

The SETUP.INF file is a comma-delineated text file formatted for 160 columns that
supplies customized directions to the SETUP.EXE.

Preferred Workstation Setup Method
----------------------------------

Install Windows 3.0 on a network (see pages 543-556 of the "Microsoft Windows
User's Guide"), and then run the SETUP /N command on each workstation. In some
instances (for example, large workstation groups) it may not be efficient to do
this and then customize each workstation individually. By editing the SETUP.INF
file with a text editor, it is possible to enhance the SETUP /N command so that
it customizes each workstation to a company standard.
