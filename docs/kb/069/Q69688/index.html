SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses video drivers for the Cornerstone single-page monitor for
Microsoft Windows 3.0 and the dual-page monitor for Windows 3.0 and 3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Cornerstone Technology has Windows 3.0-compatible video display drivers for its
single-page large-screen display. These drivers can be downloaded from the
Cornerstone bulletin board service (BBS) or you can order them on disk from
Cornerstone. Cornerstone recommends downloading the README.DOC file and reading
the instructions before you attempt to download the drivers from the BBS.

NOTE: Cornerstone Technology video display drivers dated before 2/1/91 need to be
updated.

You need to add the following line to the SYSTEM.INI file in the [386Enh] section
to prevent Windows from using the video extended memory segment that the
Cornerstone Technology drivers use.

  EMMEXCLUDE=B000-BFFF

Cornerstone Dual-Page Video Driver for Windows 3.0 and 3.1
----------------------------------------------------------

Cornerstone has developed a video driver for the dual-page monitor to run under
Windows operating system versions 3.0 and 3.1. The driver, VIDDRVR.SYS version
2.004 (for Windows 3.0) or 2.004a (for Windows 3.1), is loaded in the CONFIG.SYS
file.

NOTE: Versions of this driver earlier than 2.004 may cause the following error
message after you minimize a Windows-based application:

  Progman.exe caused a General Protection Fault in Progman.exe

Cornerstone provides many drivers on its BBS, including the video device driver
VIDDRVR.SYS version 2.004a. This driver is loaded in the CONFIG.SYS file as
follows:

       device=[drive:][path]viddrvr.sys

Do not load this device high. If you do, the following error message is
displayed:

  Invalid Vxd Dynamic Link Call to Device #000A, Service 0007

NOTE: VIDDRVR.SYS version 2.004 displays the Windows 3.0 logo. The version 2.004a
driver displays a combination Cornerstone and Windows logo.
