-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When your computer resolves a name that you entered as a CNAME in DNS, you
receive the following error messages

- When you try to ping the CNAME &lt;x&gt; like x.y.z.,where x.y.z. is a fully
  qualified domain name (FQDN):

  Bad IP address

- When you use Nslookup to resolve the CNAME x &lt;x&gt; like x.y.z.,where
  x.y.z. is a FQDN:

  Can't find x.y.z.: non-existent domain

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because name resolution for CNAME records does not work when
the corresponding "A" record resides in a delegated subzone.
