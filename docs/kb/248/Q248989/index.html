The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you are using Systems Management Server (SMS) 1.2 or 2.0 to remotely
control Microsoft Windows NT 4.0-based clients, you can use the Accelerated
Screen Transfer driver (Idisntkm.dll) to increase the remote control
performance.

The Accelerated Screen Transfer driver is compatible with a large number of
third-party video adapters and their drivers. However, Microsoft does not assume
responsibility for making the two drivers work together if there is an
incompatibility with a particular manufacturer's video adapter or its driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you install the Remote Control agent on the Windows NT 4.0-based client,
the client attempts to load the Idisntkm.dll driver when it is restarted. If
Idisntkm.dll and the system's video adapter driver are not compatible, the
"idisntkm" entry is removed from the following registry value on the Windows
NT-based client:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\&lt;video driver
  name&gt;\Device0

  Registry value: InstalledDisplayDrivers

If there is an incompatibility, a newer version of the video adapter driver may
correct it. To obtain an updated version of the video adapter driver, contact
the manufacturer of the video adapter.
