-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you compose a message that includes a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
one-off address and display name on the Cc line, and then send the message to a
Lotus Notes recipient, the Notes recipient may reply all to the message. When
you view the reply in an e-mail client, the SMTP address may appear in the
following format:

  "User1@Host1@SMTP@Domain1" &lt;User1@Host1&gt;@SMTP@Domain1

Note that multiple SMTP addresses are appended, which is not the correct format.
As a result, if you attempt to reply all to the original reply, the new reply
cannot be delivered to the SMTP recipient. This issue is known to occur when the
messages are sent between an Exchange Server computer and a Notes Release 5 (R5)
server through the Exchange Notes Connector, and the Notes recipient uses a
Notes R5 client to reply all to the original message.

In addition, if you compose a new message that includes an implicitly
encapsulated SMTP address and display name on the Cc line, and then send the
message from a Notes R5 client to an Exchange Server recipient, the address may
not be formatted correctly when the Exchange Server recipient views the message
in an e-mail client. However, if the Exchange Server recipient replies all to
the message, the reply is successfully delivered to the SMTP recipient.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs when the Exchange Notes Connector incorrectly parses an SMTP
address that includes a display name enclosed in quotes and containing one or
more at signs (@).

In addition, when an Exchange Server user replies all to a message that contains
an address in this format, a complete address is used as a display name, causing
Notes to construct an invalid Internet address in the following format:

  ""User1@Host1@SMTP@Domain1" &lt;User1@Host1&gt;@SMTP@Domain1"
  &lt;User1@Host1&gt;@SMTP@Domain1

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In an implicitly encapsulated SMTP address, the user and domain names are
enclosed in angle brackets (&lt;&gt;), but "@SMTP" is not included in the
address.
