SYMPTOMS
========

When connecting to Internet Information Services using a Web browser, you may
receive the following error message:

  HTTP 403.6 - Forbidden: IP address rejected

CAUSE
=====

Each client has a unique IP address. If the server defines a list of IP
addresses that are not allowed to access the site and the IP address you are
using is on this list, you will receive the error message.

This is a feature that grants or denies specific users access to a Web site,
directory, or file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

1. Using the Internet Service Manager (Microsoft Management Console), open the
  Internet Information Server (IIS) snap-in and select the Web site reporting
  the 403.6 error. Right-click the Web site, virtual directory, or file where
  the error is occurring. Click Properties to display the property sheet for
  that item.

2. Select the appropriate Directory Security or File Security property page.
  Under IP Address and Domain Name Restrictions, click Edit.

3. In the IP Address and Domain Name Restrictions dialog box, if the Denied
  Access option is selected, then add the IP address, network ID, or domain of
  the computer that requires access to the exceptions list.

  In the IP Address and Domain Name Restrictions dialog box, if the Granted
  Access option is selected, then remove the IP address, network ID, or domain
  of the computer that requires access to the exceptions list.

IMPORTANT:

- When you set security properties for a specific Web site, you automatically
  set the same security properties for directories and files belonging to that
  site, unless the security properties of the individual directories and files
  have been previously set.

- Your Web server will prompt you for permission to reset the properties of
  individual directories and files when you attempt to set security properties
  for your Web site. If you choose to reset these properties, your previous
  security settings will be replaced by the new settings. The same condition
  applies when you set security properties for a directory containing
  subdirectories or files with previously set security properties.

NOTES:

- By default, some sites are only granted access from the IP address 127.0.0.1,
  which corresponds to the computer name localhost and is considered a
  different address/name than the NetBIOS or fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
  of the Web server. To access a site restricted to localhost, you must be at
  the console of the computer with the localhost restriction.

- Computers accessing your server across proxy servers will appear to have the
  IP address of the proxy server.

- Restricting by domain name is not recommended because it decreases the
  performance of your Web server by forcing the Web server to perform a reverse
  DNS lookup for each connection to that site. In addition to increasing the
  load on the Web server, reverse lookups can also result in unexpected
  denials. For additional information, click the article number below to view
