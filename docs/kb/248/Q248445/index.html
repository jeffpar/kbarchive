SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform an upgrade to an Exchange Server 5.5 service pack, the
following error message may be displayed:

  Processing file [SP install path]\sp2\eng\server\setup\i386\shared.ins at or
  near line 48
  Access is denied
  NT ID: 0xC0020005

The following event ID may be logged in the System log:

  Event ID: 7028
  Source: Service control manager
  Description:
  The winreg registry key denied access to system account programs. The Service
  Control Manager took ownership of the registry key.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the account that you use to log on to Microsoft Windows
NT Server does not have sufficient permissions to modify the Winreg registry
key.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, you need to edit the registry:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate and select the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurePipeServers\Winreg

3. On the Security menu, click Permissions.
