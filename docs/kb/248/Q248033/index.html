NOTE: This article is written for Internet Information Services (IIS) administrators. If you are not an IIS administrator, but you want to understand what this error message means when you see it in your Web browser, please see the following Knowledge Base article instead: 

  Q264284 What to Do When You Receive 'The Page Cannot be Found' Error Message
  in Your Browser

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Web page is requested, the following error message is displayed at the
top of the Web browser:

  The page cannot be found
  The page you are looking for might have been removed, had its name changed, or
  is temporarily unavailable.

The following error message is also displayed further down on the Web page:

  HTTP 404 - File not found
  Internet Information Services

CAUSE
=====

The Web server returns the "HTTP 404 - File not found" error message when it
cannot retrieve the page that was requested.

The following are some common causes of this error message:

- The requested file has been renamed.
- The requested file has been moved to another location and/or deleted.
- The requested file is temporarily unavailable due to maintenance, upgrades,
  or other unknown causes.
- The requested file does not exist.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, verify that the file requested in the browser's URL
exists on the IIS computer and that it is in the correct location.

Use the IIS Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in to determine where the
file requested should exist in the IIS computer's file system.

This is particularly important if the Web site uses a virtual directory (VDIR),
which is a directory that is not contained in the home directory of the Web
site, but appears to client browser as though it does.

For example, assume that the URL that caused the 404 error is
http://Microsoft.Com/Test/File1.htm, and the IIS snap-in shows that for
Microsoft.Com Web site, the /Test/ directory is actually a virtual directory
that maps to the location of c:\Information on the IIS computer. This means that
you need to verify that the File1.htm file is located in the c:\Information
directory (and that the file name is spelled correctly).
