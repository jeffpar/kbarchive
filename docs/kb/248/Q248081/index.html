  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

Some users may be unable to log on to their mailboxes by using Microsoft Outlook
Web Access (OWA) if they use their SMTP addresses, and the following error
message may be displayed:

  OWA was unable to get to your inbox.

This problem occurs suddenly, and it is permanent. In some cases, the users can
log on to their mailboxes by using their aliases or their first and last names.

This problem does not occur if the users log on by using a MAPI client, such as
Microsoft Outlook.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the maximum size limit for user profiles is reached,
which is 0x2000 (in hexadecimal) by default.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, an administrator can increase the profile limit by
changing the setting in the registry on the Internet Information Service (IIS)
server.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the ProfileMemMaxSize value under the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Window
  MessagingSubSystem\Application\Inetinfo

  NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. On the Edit menu, click DWORD, type "0x4000 " (without the quotation marks),
  and then click OK.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

5. Stop and restart the IIS.

After an administrator performs these steps, the users are able to access their
mailboxes by using their SMTP addresses again.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

- An administrator can re-create the entry in the directory by moving the
  mailbox to another server or by using the Exmerge utility, and then deleting
  or re-creating the mailbox on the same server (many sites have only one
  server).

- Users can use their aliases or their first and last names to log on to their
  mailboxes when they use OWA.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With a modified version of the Logon.inc file, the following error message is
logged:

  Error Number: -2147024882
  Error Description: There is not enough memory available to perform the
  operation.
  [Microsoft Exchange Server Information Store - [E_OUTOFMEMORY(8007000E)]]
