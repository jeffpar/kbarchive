The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The information in this article applies only to Host Security Users who are configured for the Password is Replicated option in Host Account Manager (UDConfig.exe).

SYMPTOMS
========

Although it's possible to change the service account password that the Host
Security Services run under, a future problem may eventually occur for end-users
who are configured to replicate their Windows NT password to an AS/400 user
database (or a mainframe user database if third-party software is being used).
This is described in the "More Information" section of this article.

When the Host Security service account password is changed, anytime an end-user
changes their Windows NT password, the Event Viewer application log records the
following two events:

  Event 630 - Type:Warning

  RPC Layer returned error 0x5 (Access is denied.) This may happen if host
  security is not installed or the user account the service is running under,
  is not privileged to send messages to the remote end.

  Event 670 - Type:Error

  Password Change DLL was unable to open the RPC connection.

If an SNA WinNT Account Synchronization trace (PMPINTx.ATF) was taken during the
time of a failure, an error similar to the following occurs:

  stisupp.cpp(2795) SendGenericMessage About to invoke RPC on binding
  dc76dcd0-c084-11cf-a65e-0020afc28c52@ncacn_np:\\\\&lt;Server_Name&gt;
  0030:0182 10:07:49.0580

  stisupp.cpp(2827) SendGenericMessage RPC on binding
  dc76dcd0-c084-11cf-a65e-0020afc28c52@ncacn_np:\\\\&lt;Server_Name&gt;
  returned error: 0x5 (Access is denied. )0030:0182 10:07:49.0580

  stisupp.cpp(2842) SendGenericMessage RPC Layer returned error 0x5 (Access is
  denied.) This may happen if host security is not installed or the user
  account the service is running under, is not privileged to send messages to
  the remote end.0030:0182 10:07:49.0580

  hsevents.cpp(78) HsLogEvent ERROR CODE 0xA1500276, strings:""

CAUSE
=====

During the Host Security installation, the Setup program stores the Host
Security service account name and password in the Local Security Authority
(LSA). In addition to this, another service account copy is managed by the
Service Configuration Manager (SCM). When the service account password is
changed, the "new" service account password information is updated to the SCM;
however, the one stored by the Setup program in the LSA is never updated.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain
Lsainput.exe. Lsainput.exe synchronizes the LSA with the new service account
password being used.

Because all Host Security Services store and retrieve the service account
password from its own "local" LSA, Lsainput.exe needs to be run on any computer
where a Host Security component (service) is installed so that every
local/private LSA copy is updated.

information on support costs, please go to the following address on the World
Wide Web:

WORKAROUND
==========

A temporary workaround is to change the service account password back to what it
was before.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.


MORE INFORMATION
================

When Windows NT receives a password change, the request is intercepted by the
SNA Password Change DLL (Snapwchg.dll). This DLL is responsible for coordinating
the password change between Windows NT and host systems (AS/400 or mainframe).
Because this DLL communicates with other Host Security components (services)
through Remote Procedure Calls (RPC), an RPC request is issued to the SNA
Password Management Process (SNAPMP). Because the LSA was never updated to
reflect the "new" service account password change, the RPC request fails, and
the Host Account Cache (HAC) does not get updated. If the HAC is never updated,
the end-users' "new" Windows NT password change never gets to the AS/400 or host
system user database.

It is important to understand that even though the HAC is not updated, the
Windows NT user database is. From this point forward, the Windows NT user
database is out of sync with the HAC and the host system database.

Although the Windows NT database is now out of sync with the HAC, applications
written to take advantage of Single Sign-On (SSO) will continue to work as long
as the host system allows the existing password access. It is here where the
possibility for future failures might occur.

For example, if an AS/400 or host system enforces rules on user accounts (similar
to account policies in Windows NT), at some point, the host password will
expire. When this occurs, if an end-user attempts to synchronize their Windows
NT Password with the host system, the HAC is never updated, and SSO then fails
because the password on the host side has expired.
