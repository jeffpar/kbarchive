SYMPTOMS
========

When you start any of the programs listed above, your computer may stop
responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the video driver for your video adapter is outdated.
This has been known to happen on the following video adapters:

- nVIDIA Ge-Force 256 chip set

- Matrox G400 dual head with video card drivers older than version 5.32.010 of
  Apr, 25 2001


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, contact your hardware manufacturer for information about
how to obtain and install the most recent video driver available for your video
adapter.

For information about how to contact your hardware manufacturer, click the
appropriate article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

To work around this issue, reduce graphics hardware acceleration:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. Click the Performance tab, and then click Graphics.

4. Move the Hardware Acceleration slider until it is one notch to the right of
  None (the Basic acceleration setting).

5. Click OK, and then click Close.

6. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Yes.

  NOTE: If you encounter any problems after you reduce graphics hardware
  acceleration, follow these steps to restore graphics hardware acceleration to
  the original setting:

  a. Restart Windows in Safe mode. To do this, follow the appropriate steps for
     your operating system.

     Microsoft Windows 98:

     Restart your computer, press and hold down the CTRL key after your computer
     completes the Power On Self Test (POST), and then choose Safe Mode from
     the Startup menu.

     Microsoft Windows 95:

     Restart your computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message,
     press the F8 key, and then choose Safe Mode from the Startup menu.

  b. When Windows starts in Safe mode, click OK.

  c. Repeat steps 1 through 6, but in step 4 move the Hardware Acceleration
     slider back to its original position.

If getting updated video drivers do not help, or no drivers are available, then
try the work around steps below.

Change to 800 x 600 x 256 Color
-------------------------------

1. Click Start, point to Settings, then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Display.

3. Click the Settings tab. Write down your Colors and Screen area settings.

4. In the Colors section, click to select 256 Colors.

5. In the Screen area section, drag the slider to 800 x 600.

6. Click OK.

7. If you receive a prompt to restart the computer, click Yes.

If the steps above do not help, then try the next section: Reduce Graphics
Acceleration

2. Double-click System.

3. Click the Performance tab, and then click Graphics.

4. Move the Hardware acceleration slider left one notch.

5. Click OK, and then click OK again.

6. Try to reproduce the problem. If the problem persists, repeat steps 1-5 again
  until all settings have been tried.
