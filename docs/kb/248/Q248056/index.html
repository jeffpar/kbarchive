-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes may shut itself down and you
may be unable to restart it. The following events may be logged in the log file
from the Connectivity Controller service:

  31900 Call Product Support, error=invalid parameter
  08226 Process LME-NOTES-NTSMEX terminated abnormally
  08277 Shutting down LME-NOTES-Service

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if a malformed message comes from Notes to Exchange Server
and the malformed message are not moved to the Bad folder. This malformed
message is a non-delivery report (NDR) that contains no intended recipients.

The intended recipient is the address that the original mail was sent to. That
address is reused to populate the To field when you try to resend the mail after
you open the NDR.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, delete the bad e-mail messages in the Exchange.box
file, and then restart the Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 3. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server
5.5 Service Pack 4.

Additional query words: Non Delivery Report
