SUMMARY
=======

When you enable secure communications (SSL and TLS) on an Internet Information
Services (IIS) 5.0 computer, you must first obtain a server certificate. With
the integration of certificates in Windows 2000 and the new additions to IIS
5.0, there are several ways to obtain a server certificate.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Usually, you would use the Web Server Certificate Wizard to perform this task;
however, you can also use the Web forms that are included with Certificate
Services 2.0 to create a key pair that is signed by your CA without having to
use the Web Server Certificate Wizard. This can save time if you do not already
have a site configured, but already know the information needed to create the
certificate for the site.

To create a server certificate, perform the following steps:

NOTE: You must be an administrator to complete the following steps.

1. On the computer where the Web site will reside, browse to your certificate
  server's Web pages (usually located at http://servername/certsrv, where
  servername is the name of the server hosting IIS and the certificate server).

2. Choose Request a Certificate, and then click Next.

3. Choose Advanced Request, and then click Next.

4. Choose Submit a Certificate Request to This CA Using a Form, and then click
  Next.

5. Under Identifying Information, in the Name field, choose a common name for
  the Web site.

  For example, if users will type "https://server" into their browser, then the
  common name would be "server." However, if the user will contact your site
  using "https://www.server.com," then the common name will need to reflect
  this by using "www.server.com" as the server name.

6. For the rest of the information under Identifying Information, follow the
  instructions for e-mail, company, and so on.

7. In the Intended Purpose section, choose Server Authentication Certificate
  from the drop-down list.

8. In the Key Options section, leave everything at the defaults, but click to
  enable the Use Local Machine Store option.

9. Be sure to enable the Mark Private Key as Exportable check box if you want to
  backup this key pair later (recommended). If you do not do this, you will not
  have the option to export the private key at a later time (only the public
  key).

10. Click Submit.

11. When you are prompted to Install the Certificate, do so. This adds the
  certificate to your certificate store (the local computer store).

Now that you have a certificate in the local computer store, in order to use it
in IIS, do the following:

1. Open the Internet Services Manager (or custom MMC containing IIS) and
  navigate to the site where you want to enable secure communications.

2. Right-click on the Web site and choose Properties.

3. On the properties page for the site, click the Directory Security tab.

4. Click Server Certificate.

5. When the Web Server Certificate Wizard appears, click Next.

6. Choose Assign an Existing Certificate, and then click Next.

7. In the list, choose the certificate that you added to the store using the
  Certificate Web Forms, and then click Next.

8. When the summary screen appears, showing you the certificate you are about to
  bind to the Web site, make sure the information is correct. If everything
  looks good, click Next.

9. Click Finish to close the wizard.

10. Test your site to make sure you can access it using an https request (for
  example, https://common name).

For more information, see the Internet Information Services 5.0 online
documentation, which can be found at http://localhost/IISHelp (the default
path).
