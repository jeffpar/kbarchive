-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Anyone with Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator permissions within an
organization has the ability to create an Address Book view that can cause
adverse affects within an entire organization. The Address Book view can be
created from any Exchange Server computer or site within an organization. These
Address Book views may cause each server's Exchange Server directory service to
consume 100 percent of the CPU resources as the Address Book views are
replicated to each server in the organization. This may cause the Exchange
Server directory services to be inaccessible or a global address list to be
unavailable.

CAUSE
=====

Each Exchange Server computer builds the Address Book view based on Grouped by
Attributes (GBA) that are replicated between sites and servers. If the Address
Book views are poorly designed or frequently changed, the server may use a large
number of CPU cycles on the directory to regenerate these views. Any person with
permissions for the site naming context has permissions to alter the Address
Book view.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you apply this fix, a new heuristics bit is defined on the Address Book
View container. Setting the heuristic bit to 1 blocks the inheritance of the
permissions from the site container. After the change, which is replicated
throughout the organization, only the permissions set explicitly on the Address
Book View container are effective.

WARNING: The change in the permission model should not be implemented without
proper planning and only after assigning permission Administrators explicitly on
the Address Book View in every site.

To properly handle the explicit permission on the Address Book Views it is
strongly recommended to use Admin Fix described in Microsoft Knowledge Base
article Q262773.

The fix described in this article ensures that:

- The graphical user interface reflects the effective permissions

- With the Admin Fix it is not possible to remove the "Modify Permission" right
  from the last and only Admin and thus loosing the ability to administer
  permissions of the Address Book Views within the site.

- A Warning is received when removing the permission Admin role from the
  account which is currently logged on.

- A Warning is received when removing the last Account and thus removing the
  security from the object allowing anybody to modify it.

To enable the new heuristics bit:

WARNING: Using the raw mode of the Exchange Server Administrator program (admin
/r) incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall
Microsoft Windows NT Server and/or Microsoft Exchange Server. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of raw mode can be
solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.

1. Start the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program in raw mode by
  typing the following at a command prompt:

  "c:\exchsrvr\bin\admin /r" (without the quotation marks)

2. Click the Address Book container, and then click Raw Properties on the File
  menu.

3. In the "List Attributes of Type" list, click All.

4. Click Heuristics in the list of attributes.

5. In the Edit box, type "1" (without the quotation marks), click Set, and then
  click OK.

IMPORTANT: Although the heuristics flag replicates between sites, you must add a
Microsoft Windows NT account to the Permissions tab of the Address Book view
properties for the Address Book view for each site because the Windows NT
account does not replicate between sites.
