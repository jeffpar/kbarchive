-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

During the move of a mailbox from one Exchange Server computer to another,
messages may not be delivered to the primary recipient and no non-delivery
report (NDR) is sent to the message originator. This behavior occurs when the
following conditions exist:

- The user whose mailbox is moved has an alternate recipient.

- The deliver option to send to both the alternate recipient and the primary is
  selected.

- The delivery attempt occurs during the actual move user operation.

CAUSE
=====

The message is delivered to the alternate recipient, but deferred to the primary
recipient. At the end of the move operation, another attempt is made to deliver
the mail. When the delivery fails because the correct user address is not in the
message transfer agent (MTA) cache, no NDR is generated. With the fixed version
of MTA, an NDR is generated and delivered to the message originator.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

As a workaround, you can remove the alternate recipient before you move a
mailbox, and after the move, re-assign the alternate recipient.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 4.
