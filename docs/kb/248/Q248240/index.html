SYMPTOMS
========

When using Visual SourceSafe in a development environment where users are
accessing the same database from multiple time zones, Visual SourceSafe does not
handle the conversion from one time zone to another properly.

CAUSE
=====

Visual SourceSafe takes the timestamp off the client computer and uses that when
doing any Visual SourceSafe functions. This time is not converted into anything
global, like Universal Time Coordinate (UTC). This means that people in
different time zones, working at the same time, look to Visual SourceSafe as if
they are working at different times.

RESOLUTION
==========

Synchronize the Times:

Synchronize the dates and system clocks for all Visual SourceSafe client
computers with the Visual SourceSafe server. This prevents check-in and
check-out operations from appearing to happen out of sequence and effects any
labels that are applied. Synchronizing dates and system clocks is particularly
important when users from different time zones access the same database.

You can set up a Windows NT Server to act as a Domain Time Source server for
users to synchronize their local date and time with the network. For additional
information, see the Knowledge Base article "How to Set Up and Synchronize with
Domain Time Source Servers" listed below.

SourceOffSite:

There is a third-party utility that allows the timestamp from the server to be
used for all Visual SourceSafe activity. This allows users to keep their system
clocks in the proper time zone and Visual SourceSafe functions properly. See the
"SourceOffSite" link below for more information from their Web site.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
