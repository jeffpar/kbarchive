-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a user logs off a Terminal Server that has the "Delete cached copies of
roaming profiles" policy enabled, the local profile folder may not be deleted.
When this occurs, an additional folder may be created on the Terminal Server,
causing the amount of disk space used by the roaming profiles to increase.

Note that this behavior is also recorded in the Userenv.log file.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if users are using the Novell client for NetWare version
4.6 with Novell NetWare Client Service Pack 1 or Service Pack 2 to connect to a
Terminal Server that has the "Delete cached copies of roaming profiles" policy
enabled. The Novell client writes data to the Winnt\Profiles\&lt;User name&gt;
folder after the local cache profile is deleted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, assign the following permissions to the
Winnt\Profiles folder:

- Administrators: Full Control
- System: Full Control
- Creator Owner: Full Control
- Users: Read

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The issue described in this article may cause multiple folders to be created in
the Winnt\Profiles folder for a user. The extra folders are typically named with
the user name followed by a three-digit number. For example:

- Winnt\Profiles\&lt;User name&gt;\Desktop
- Winnt\Profiles\&lt;User name&gt;.000\Desktop
- Winnt\Profiles\&lt;User name&gt;.001\Desktop
