The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When the LsaLookupSids() function in Windows NT Local Security Authority (LSA)
is used to determine the Security Identifier (SID) associated with a particular
user or group name, invalid or contradictory arguments passed to the function
may not be handled correctly. The result may cause LSA to cease functioning
properly and prevent the computer from working. You can restart an affected
computer to put it back into service, but any work that was in progress at the
time is lost.

NOTE: This vulnerability does not affect computers running Microsoft Windows
2000.

RESOLUTION

STATUS
======

Windows NT Server or Workstation 4.0
------------------------------------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
----------------------------------------------

Microsoft has confirmed that this problem could result in some degree of security
vulnerability in Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem
was first corrected in Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service
Pack 6.

MORE INFORMATION
================

LSA provides security services for Windows NT. Among other tasks, it
authenticates all logon requests, adjudicates users' privileges, determines
whether users can gain access to requested resources, and oversees the security
auditing functions. The loss of the LSA service through this vulnerability
essentially renders the computer unable to perform any useful work because all
requests for services are denied by default.

When a user makes a service request that calls LsaLookupSids(), Windows NT
performs a security check to verify that the user has sufficient privileges
before fulfilling the request. There is no capability through this vulnerability
to bypass the security check. However, the computer stops responding before the
check is made, so any user, regardless of privilege, could levy the request and
cause the LSA to stop responding. Although it is possible to call LSA functions
remotely, doing so requires NetBIOS. If you follow standard recommended security
practices, NetBIOS should be filtered through a firewall, preventing an external
request from reaching your computer.
