The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word 97, the color of the Previous Page and Next Page buttons on
the vertical scroll bar change to blue, and the ToolTips change to Previous
Find/GoTo and Next Find/GoTo.

Also, when you press these buttons or their shortcut keys (CTRL+PAGE UP or
CTRL+PAGE DOWN), the insertion point either remains in the same place, goes to
an incorrect location, or Word displays the following message:

  Word has reached the {beginning or end} of the document. Do you want to
  continue searching at the {beginning or end}?


CAUSE
=====

The Previous Page and Next Page buttons are black by default. When a different
browse object type is selected, other than Browse By Page, the buttons turn blue
to indicate that the Previous and Next buttons have been reassigned. The
ToolTips for these buttons also indicate the current button assignments.

For example, the prompt to "continue searching" indicates that a search is
active, and the buttons have been reassigned to Previous Find/GoTo and Next
Find/GoTo.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use any of the following methods to reset the Previous and Next buttons to
Previous Page and Next Page.

Method 1: Reset the Select Browse Object to Browse By Page
----------------------------------------------------------

Click the Select Browse Object button (located between the Next and Previous
buttons on the scroll bar), and then click the Browse By Page icon (far right,
top row).

Method 2: Create Macros to Reset the Buttons Automatically
----------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft provides examples of Visual Basic for Applications procedures for
illustration only, without warranty either expressed or implied, including, but
not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a
particular purpose. The Visual Basic procedures in this article are provided 'as
is' and Microsoft does not guarantee that they can be used in all situations.
While Microsoft support professionals can help explain the functionality of a
particular macro, they will not modify these examples to provide added
functionality, nor will they help you construct macros to meet your specific
needs. If you have limited programming experience, you may want to consult one
of the Microsoft Solution Providers. Solution Providers offer a wide range of
fee-based services, including creating custom macros. For more information about
Microsoft Solution Providers, call Microsoft Customer Information Service at
(800) 426-9400.

You will need to create two macros (BrowseNext and BrowsePrev) that will
automatically reset the Browse Object buttons when you click them. Use the
following procedure to create the macros.

To create the BrowseNext macro, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Word 97 document.

2. On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Macros.

3. Under Macro Name, type "BrowseNext" (without the quotation marks). In the
  Macros In box, click to select "All active templates and Documents," and then
  click Create.

  NOTE: This macro has to be called BrowseNext so that it will function When you
  click the Next Page button.

4. Change the existing BrowseNext macro to the following:

        Sub BrowseNext()
        '
        ' BrowseNext Macro
        ' Jump to the next browse object.
        '
           Application.Browser.Target=wdBrowsePage
           Application.Browser.Next

        End Sub

5. On the File menu, click Save Normal.

6. On the File menu, click Close and Return to Microsoft Word.

To create the BrowsePrev macro, follow these steps:

1. With your new Word 97 document still open, on the Tools menu, point to Macro,
  and then click Macros.

2. Under Macro Name type "BrowsePrev" (without the quotation marks). In the
  Macros In box, click to select "All active templates and documents", and then
  click Create.

  NOTE: This macro has to be called BrowsePrev so that it will function when you
  click the Previous Page button.

3. Change the existing BrowsePrev macro to the following:

        Sub BrowsePrev()
        '
        ' BrowsePrev Macro
        ' Jump to the previous browse object
        '
           Application.Browser.Target=wdBrowsePage
           Application.Browser.Previous
        End Sub

4. On the File menu, click Save Normal.

5. On the File menu, click "Close and Return to Microsoft Word."

Method 3: Record Resetting the Select Browse Object to Browse by Page
---------------------------------------------------------------------

To record the action of resetting the Browse Object to Browse by Page:

1. On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and click Record New Macro.

2. Enter a name for the macro in the Macro Name box, and click OK.

3. Click the Select Browse Object button (located between the Next and Previous
  buttons on the scroll bar), and then click the Browse By Page icon (far
  right, top row).

4. On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and click Stop Recording.

You can then assign this macro to a toolbar or menu item.

For more information about how to assign a macro to a toolbar, click the Office
Assistant, type "How do I assign a macro" (without the quotation marks), click
Search, click the "Add a button to a toolbar" topic, and then click to view "Add
a button to a toolbar."

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Microsoft Help is not installed on your computer, please

MORE INFORMATION
================

Browse Buttons
--------------

The Select Browse Object button (located between the Next and Previous buttons on
the scrollbar) enables you to select a number of additional object types. Word
may assign one of the following properties to the Next and Previous buttons
after you attempt to go to any of these objects:

  Field
  Endnote
  Footnote
  Comment
  Section
  Edits
  Heading
  Graphic
  Table

For example, if you attempt to go to a comment, the buttons change to Previous
Comment and Next Comment. Another example would be when you click Find on the
Edit menu. Once you click Find to find an item, the Select Browse Object buttons
will be set to Next or Previous Find/GoTo.

For more information about the Select Browse Object buttons, click the Office
Assistant, type "What is select browse object?" (without the quotation marks),
click Search, click the "Move around in a document" topic, and then click to
view "Scroll through a document by using the mouse."

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Microsoft Help is not installed on your computer, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q120802 Office: How to Add/Remove a Single Office Program or Component

CTRL+PAGE UP and CTRL+PAGE DOWN
-------------------------------

When you press the CTRL+PAGE DOWN shortcut key, Word should place the insertion
point at the top of the next page.

When you press the CTRL+PAGE UP shortcut key, Word should place the insertion
point at the top of the previous page.
