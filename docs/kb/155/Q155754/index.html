-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0, 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual C++, versions 4.0, 4.1, 4.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual C++, when attempting to add a file that does not reside in the
directory tree rooted at the directory containing the Visual C++ makefile to
source code control, you may receive the following error:

  File &lt;filename&gt; could not be mapped to the SourceSafe project
  &lt;SourceSafe project name&gt;

While this article refers to Visual C++, the same error occurs in the same
circumstances in other integrated applications such as Visual Basic, FoxPro and
Access.

CAUSE
=====

SourceSafe could not find a corresponding file on your SourceSafe server. Often,
SourceSafe uses the directory structure on your local hard drive to provide
clues as to which SourceSafe project the file resides in. In this case, the
mapping between your directory structure on your local hard drive and the
project structure on your SourceSafe server could not be made.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you have not done so, you will need to add the file (that you are attempting
to add to source-code control in Visual C++) to a different SourceSafe project
from the SourceSafe project containing the Visual C++ makefile. Depending on how
you set up the SourceSafe project, you may or may not be able to use the Visual
C++ integrated source-code control.

For best results, mirror your local directory structure on your SourceSafe
server. For example, if your file is in C:\common\resources, then add the file
to a SourceSafe project $/common/resources. All of this must be done using
either the SourceSafe Explorer or SS.EXE from the Command prompt.

For information on sharing files between projects, please see article ID Q155678
- How to Share Files Under Source-Code Control in Visual C++.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
