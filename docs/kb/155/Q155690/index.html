SUMMARY
=======

Regaut.exe is a sample Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) Appwizard- generated
application that shows how to register a running object as active in the running
object table (ROT) so that multiple clients can connect to it. The CDocument
derived class CRegautDoc of this sample acts as the automation object, which is
registered in the running object table every time a new document is created or
an existing document is opened. By registering its document as active, this
sample application demonstrates how multiple clients can attach to a single
automation object in a local server and share its data.

NOTE: Use the -d option when running Regaut.exe to decompress the file and
re-create the proper directory structure.

The Regaut sample includes a Visual Basic client application called Vbclient.exe.
Vbclient.exe tries to attach to the Regaut server's document by calling the
Visual Basic GetObject API, which looks for the object in the ROT; if that
fails, it creates the object using the Visual Basic CreateObject API. Once the
first Vbclient.exe has been started, more instances of Vbclient.exe can be
started, which attach to the already running Regaut document. All instances of
Vbclient.exe share the same automation object. A C++ version of Vbclient.exe,
Vcclient.exe, is also included.

Another way to use this sample is to start the Regaut.exe application. After
Regaut is running, start as many instances of Vbclient.exe as you want. All of
these instances attach to the already running Regaut document. Each instance of
Vbclient.exe can retrieve and change the Regaut document's data. When the
Vbclient.exe applications are done accessing the Regaut document's data, they
can shut down, leaving Regaut running with its document containing the data from
the last Vbclient.exe that changed Regaut's data.

Regaut.exe also demonstrates the correct way to leave an automation server
running if the automation client makes the automation server's application
window visible. If during the course of automating a server, a client makes the
server[ASCII 146]s application window visible, the server should shut down only
in response to an explicit user or automation client command (such as the Exit
command from the File menu or the equivalent).

The CRegautDoc::RegisterAsActive() function registers the Regaut document as
active when a new document is created or when an existing document is opened. It
does this by registering The CRegautDoc's IUnknown pointer in the running object
table using the OLE API RegisterActiveObject. RegisterActiveObject has the
following prototype:

     HRESULT RegisterActiveObject (IUnknown FAR* punk,
                                   REFCLSID rclsid,
                                   DWORD dwFlags,
                                   unsigned long FAR* pdwRegister);

NOTE: punk is the IUnknown * for the object we want to register. You get this
pointer in Regaut by calling CCmdTarget::GetControllingUnknown().

The rclsid parameter is the clsid of the local server, which OLE uses to identify
this object in the ROT. Automation clients use this clsid to search for this
object in the ROT and to create this object. This clsid is generated by
Appwizard when you choose the Automation support option while generating your
application. It is created as a member variable of the CWinApp derived class, so
Regaut just uses a helper function in CRegautApp to access this value from other
classes.

The dwFlags parameter specifies how you would like to register the active object
in the running object table. You can either register with a strong lock
ACTIVEOBJECT_STRONG or a weak lock ACTIVEOBJECT_WEAK. For automation objects,
ACTIVEOBJECT_WEAK is almost always used. Online documentation for
RegisterActiveObject in Visual C++ Books online has a detailed discussion of the
differences between registering your automation object weak versus strong. You
should be familiar with this documentation before you use RegisterActiveObject.
Regaut.exe uses ACTIVEOBJECT_WEAK.

The pdwRegister parameter is a value returned by OLE to RegisterActiveObject that
is used in calls to RevokeActiveObject to explicitly remove an object's entry
from the ROT.

When a client application has connected to Regaut and wants to make it visible,
the client calls the ShowWindow() method. Once the Regaut window is visible, the
Regaut document makes sure the Regaut application stays running after the last
client disconnects by calling AfxSetUserControl(TRUE). This ensures that
Regaut.exe will not shut down after the last client detaches but does not ensure
that the current document will close after the last client detaches.

To ensure that the current document does not close, CRegautDoc calls
CoLockObjectExternal(GetControllingUnknown(),TRUE,TRUE) to put an external lock
on the document. When the user does decide to shut down the CRegaut application
or otherwise close the document,
CoLockObjectExternal(GetControllingUnknown(),FALSE,TRUE) is called to remove the
external lock on the document object. The calls to AfxSetUserControl and
CoLockObjectExternal ensure that the automation server behaves correctly if the
application window becomes visible. Having the server's application window
become visible is also known as putting the user in control.

This article demonstrates registering an object on the Running Object Table (ROT)
with the RegisterActiveObject API. RegisterActiveObject registers an object
using that objects GUID. To uniquely identify objects of the same type on the
ROT it is necessary to register the object with a moniker. Q152087 demonstrates
how to register a moniker on the ROT with IRunningObject::Register however,
please keep in mind the this is not what this sample was written to illustrate.
