The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent might generate the following
warning in Event Viewer if a message is sent from a user whose mailbox has no
associated X.400 address:

  Event ID 178,Source:MSExchangeMTA,Category:X400 Service An error occurred
  while transferring in message C=US;A= ;P=Org;L=MTAName-#############-##
  because the Directory name could not be expanded to an O/R Address. An X.400
  API Association (XAPIA) unable-to-transfer reason code and
  unrecognized-OR-name diagnostic code were returned. (MTA SUBMIT 16 73)(14)

The following Non-Delivery Report (NDR) will be returned to the sender:

  Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

  Subject: The subject
  Sent: 8/21/96 9:56:10 pm

  The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

  'John Smith' on 8/21/96 9:58:28 am
  Unable to deliver the message due to a recipient problem
  MSEXCH:MSExchangeIS:SiteName:MTAName

RESOLUTION
==========

The problem can be corrected by adding a valid X.400 address to the sender's
mailbox properties on the Email Addresses tab in the Microsoft Exchange
Administrator program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A similar condition might also result if the recipient of the message does not
have a valid X.400 address.

This condition does not affect message delivery between mailboxes on the same
Microsoft Exchange Server because the Information Store submits the message to
the mailbox directly. It will only occur when the message is being routed to
another Microsoft Exchange Site via one of the Site Connectors, when the message
is going between two Microsoft Exchange Servers in the same Site, or when a
message is addressed to go out a connector to a foreign system, in other words,
using the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector.

The X.400 addresses in Microsoft Exchange should never be deleted because
Microsoft Exchange is a native X.400 messaging system.
