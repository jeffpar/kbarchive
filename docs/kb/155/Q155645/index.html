SYMPTOMS
========

This article documents known problems that can cause an ActiveX control to fail
to work in Visual Basic for Windows while still allowing the control to work
successfully in an MFC control container.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Occasionally an ActiveX control works successfully in an MFC control container
but fails when used in Visual Basic. The failure in Visual Basic is usually
caused by a problem with the control. The following are known problems that can
cause this type of behavior.

- The control has been created with the simple frame option specified in
  ControlWizard but there is no call to the COleControl::EnableSimpleFrame
  method.

  By default, if the simple frame option is specified, ControlWizard adds a call
  to EnableSimpleFrame to the COleControl-derived class's constructor.
  ControlWizard also adds the OLEMISC_SIMPLEFRAME MiscStatus bit to the status
  bits for the control. If the call to EnableSimpleFrame is removed but the
  OLEMISC_SIMPLEFRAME MiscStatus bit is still specified, Visual Basic crashes
  with an Access Violation when the control is added to a form.

  If the OLEMISC_SIMPLEFRAME MiscStatus bit is turned on for a control, the
  COleControl::EnableSimpleFrame method must be called.

- The control has been given a property that is declared as type BSTR in the
  control's .odl file, but which is really of some other type, such as long,
  short, or double. Typically this kind of type mismatch happens when the .odl
  file for the control has been manually edited rather than letting ClassWizard
  handle the adding and removing of properties.

  In order for the problem to occur, the property must have been added via
  ClassWizard as a non-BSTR type and have been implemented as a member
  variable, not as Get/Set methods. If the control's .odl file is manually
  edited and the type of the property is then changed to BSTR but the
  corresponding control member variable type and dispatch map entry are not
  changed to reflect the new type, Visual Basic can crash with an Access
  Violation when the control is added to a form.

- A control implements a property, event, or method that has the same name as
  one of Visual Basic's extended properties, events, or methods.

  For example, if the control implements properties named DragIcon or DragMode,
  the problem might occur.

  To avoid the problem, rename the conflicting property, event, or method.


NOTE: For information on all of Visual Basic's extended properties, methods, and
events, please refer to the online topic "Object Property" in Visual Basic.

The problem has been fixed in Visual Basic 5.0.
