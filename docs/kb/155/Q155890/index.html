-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you click the Finish button in the Visual FoxPro for Macintosh Setup
Wizard, a WAIT WINDOW appears with the message "Copying the source code
files..." followed by the following error message:

  The Setup Wizard was unable to make a copy of your source files. Setup
  terminated.

A copy of the source files is not made.

CAUSE
=====

This error may occur because the Finder Scripting Extension is not loaded or the
Power PC Modern Memory Manager is not ON.

RESOLUTION
==========

Load the Finder Scripting Extension. If you are using System 7.5, it might be
disabled in the Extensions Manager Control Panel. If you are using System 7.1.2,
obtain a copy of the Finder Scripting Extension from a System 7.5 install or
download it from Apple's Web site.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Setup Wizard uses AppleScript to tell the Finder to make a copy of the
source code files. If the Finder Scripting Extension is not loaded, the Setup
Wizard cannot communicate this to the Finder.

The Finder Scripting Extension is installed with the System 7.5 versions of the
Macintosh System Software. It is not supplied or installed with System 7.1.2.
Therefore, the Visual FoxPro Setup Wizard does not run under System 7.1.2 unless
you place the Finder Scripting Extension in the System:Extensions folder.

For Visual FoxPro users who are still running System 7.1.2, you can download the
Finder Scripting Extension from the Apple Web site. You should use version 1.2
of the Finder Scripting Extension. Apple included version 1.1 of the Finder
Scripting Extension with AppleScript 1.1.

You can find the (http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/the)
Finder Scripting Extension in the following location on the Apple Web site. This
information is subject to change, however. Apple recommends you not bookmark the
page.

Connect to http://www.apple.com. Choose Customer Support, then Apple Software
Updates Archive from the next page. From the Apple Software Updates page choose
US, then Macintosh, then System, and then Other System.

NOTE: This error may also be caused by running a product called "Mac User's Hide
Always." "Hide Always" can hide the finder. You can either disable "Hide Always"
or prevent it from hiding the finder.
