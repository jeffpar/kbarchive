The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the SMS site server and the remotely controlled computer are using separate
primary WINS servers, the SMS Administrator cannot locate the client for remote
control using TCP/IP (until the WINS database is replicated to its partner).
Once the WINS replication occurs, remote control functions normally. This
problem does not occur if the SMS site server and client computer reside on the
same network segment.

CAUSE
=====

When the remote agent is loaded on a TCP/IP client, the &lt;43&gt; extension of
the client NetBIOS name is registered on the client. It is viewable by typing
"nbtstat -n" (without quotation marks) at the command prompt on the client. This
registration is picked up by the client's WINS server and is viewable in WINS
Manager. On the appropriate interval, the &lt;43&gt; extension registration is
replicated to any of the WINS replication partners.

If you attempt a remote control session prior to the WINS replication, the server
running SMS Administrator cannot resolve the &lt;43&gt; extension of the client
name.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

- Configure the Site Server (or server running the SMS Tools) to use the same
  primary WINS server

  -or-

- Keep the remote agent loaded on all computers all the time (once the
  extension is registered and replicated the first time, no delay occurs) Keep
  in mind that the extension can be removed from WINS by rebooting or unloading
  the remote agent.

  -or-

- Use the LMHOSTS file on the server. For more information, please see the
  following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q122057 How to Use Remote Control with TCP/IP

- Upgrade to Systems Management Server version 1.2, and set the default
  protocol to TCP/IP. For more information, please see the Systems Management
  Server 1.2 Administrator's Guide, Chapter 10, "Configuring Default Protocol
  Settings for Clients". Doing this allows remote sessions to use sockets,
  avoiding NetBIOS name resolution for the remote agent. This configuration is
  supported for Windows 95, Windows NT 3.51, Windows NT 4.0, and Windows for
  Workgroups (using MSTCPIP-32) client computers.
