SYMPTOMS
========

When you restart a Microsoft Windows x86-based computer, the computer stops with
an empty, black screen immediately after the power-on self test (POST) is
completed.

CAUSE
=====

The master boot record (MBR), partition tables, boot sector, or NTLDR file is
corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

1. Create a Microsoft Windows boot disk to start the computer. For additional
  information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
  Base:

  Q119467 How to Create a Bootable Disk for an NTFS or FAT Partition

  If you can start the computer without errors, the damage is limited to the
  master boot record (MBR), boot sector, or the NTLDR file. After Windows is
  running, immediately back up any data of value. Use Disk Administrator to
  verify that partitions on the boot drive are the correct size. If there are
  invalid partitions, the best solution is to re-create those partitions and
  reformat the affected drives, then restore the data from the most recent back
  up tape. If the system cannot be started from a Windows boot disk, you will
  most likely have to reinstall Windows and restore from tape.

2. Run the latest virus scanning software to verify no virus is present.
  MS-DOS-based virus software is sufficient for this purpose, even if the file
  system is NTFS. MS-DOS-based virus programs can be run from an MS-DOS boot
  disk.

3. Ensure the master boot record (MBR) is valid. Boot from a virus-free MS-DOS
  version 5.0 or later boot disk with FDISK on it. Run the following command:

  FDISK /MBR

  WARNING: If your computer is infected virus, using the FDISK /MBR switch may
  prevent you from being able to start your computer. Before using the FDISK
  /MBR command, you should be certain that your computer is not infected with a
  virus.

  Before you perform this step, see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
  article:

  Q166454 Using FDISK /MBR for Troubleshooting Windows NT Boot Problems

4. If the primary boot partition is a file allocation table (FAT) partition,
  boot from an MS-DOS disk, perform a SYS C: command to make the drive MS-DOS
  bootable, and then perform step 5 to replace the Windows boot sector.

5. Run Windows Setup and choose the Repair option. Choose the Inspect boot
  Sector and Restore Startup Environment options. If the boot sector on the
  boot drive is corrupted, this should repair it.

6. If the system still fails to boot correctly, use Attrib.exe or File Manager
  to remove the file attributes from the NTLDR file located in the root of the
  system partition. Copy a new NTLDR file from the i386 directory of the
  Windows CD-ROM to replace the existing one.

7. If you are running Windows and the system partition is NTFS, you may have a
  fragmented MFT that prevents the system from booting.

sector below to view the article about updating the boot sector in the Microsoft
