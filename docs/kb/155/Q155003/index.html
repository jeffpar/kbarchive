-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 is version 950b of Windows 95. An OEM Service
Release is an updated version of a product for PC manufacturers (OEMs) to
preinstall on new PCs. Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2) is not available
for download.

This product is Windows 95. It contains some new hardware support and programs,
but at its core it is Windows 95. The purpose is to allow PC manufacturers
(OEMs) to install an integrated Windows 95 product that contains the latest
available individual updates and supports recent advances in hardware that
requires core operating system support.

The retail version of Windows 95 is designed to upgrade Windows 3.x PCs. The
primary contents of this service release are intended to support new hardware.
As such, it will be sold with the PCs that have these new hardware capabilities.
The only major feature that does not require specific hardware support is the
new version of Microsoft Internet Explorer.

NOTE: A retail Windows 95 (version 950) installation cannot be upgraded with
Windows 95 OSR2.

At this time, there are no plans to make these features available in a step- up,
service pack, or upgrade kit for Windows 95.

Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.0, and the individual updates that are
widely applicable to a general audience will be available for free downloads
from the Internet.

Microsoft reserves the right to revise and change these plans without notice.

Support Boundaries
------------------

Windows 95 OSR2 is a product preinstalled on OEM computers. The OEM is the
primary support provider for this product and any warranty support for it will
be handled by their support organizations and governed by the OEMs support
policies. Microsoft will provide fee-based support. Any issues with this product
concerning Y2K will be handled free of charge by Microsoft.

Any modifications made to Windows 95 OSR2 by the OEM will not be supported by
Microsoft.

Microsoft Technical Support Desktop Systems does not support OEMs, or OEM
Preinstallation Kit (OPK) issues. OEMs are supported at an OEM account level
only.

Microsoft Premier Desktop Systems supports the full functionality and usability
of OSR2 as shipped by Microsoft to the OEM. Any modifications made to Windows 95
OSR2 by the OEM will be supported by the OEM. Installation of OSR2 is supported
by Microsoft OEM support at an OEM level. On a reasonable effort basis, Premier
Desktop Systems will support installation and setup of OSR2 as a troubleshooting
step. Batch installs and netsetup are not supported by OSR2 and will not be
supported by Premier Desktop Systems support.

OSR2 is an OEM version only and allows OEMs to install an integrated Windows 95
product that supports the latest PC hardware. Windows 95 OSR2 is not licensed
and not supported for installations on PCs that were not delivered by the
manufacturer with Windows 95 OSR2 preinstalled, even if those PCs are covered by
a Windows 95 license or maintenance agreement.
