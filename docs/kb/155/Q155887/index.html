SUMMARY
=======

Since the release of the Windows Telephony (TAPI) software development kit (SDK)
for Windows 3.1 in November, 1993, there have been changes in the telephone
dialing procedures used in several countries/regions. In addition, some
countries/regions have changed country/region codes, new countries/regions have
come into existence, and other changes have occurred. TAPI obtains information
related to countries/regions and dialing rules from the [Countries] section of
the Telephon.ini file in the Windows folder. You must update the Telephon.ini
file in the Windows folder in order to use the most recent information
available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There is an entry in the [Countries] section of the Telephon.ini file for each
country/region. For example, Singapore has the following entry:

  Country65=65,66,"Singapore","G","","001EFG"

The sections in this entry are described below:

- "Country65" identifies the entry in the country/region list. The "65" after
  the word "Country" is the country/region code ID (identifier), which must be
  unique in the list (and, for most countries, is usually the same as the
  country/region code). For example, the "65" here is for Singapore. If you
  needed to change the access code for the United States, you would use
  "Country1."

- The "65" to the right of the equal sign is the country/region code for
  Singapore. "66" is the next number in the sequence of country/region codes.
  This second number may or may not be contiguous, but it must be correct.

- "Singapore" is the country/region name in this example.

- "G" is the local dialing rules. This indicates that local dialing requires
  only the local number.

- "" represents the long distance dialing rules. In Singapore, there are no
  long distance calls; therefore, there are no dialing rules for long distance.
  In the United States, this would be "1FG" indicating a 1, the area code, and
  a local number.

- "001EFG" represents the dialing rules for international dialing. 001 is the
  international dialing access number for the country/region. "EFG? represents
  the country/region code, area code, and local number for the number being
  dialed.

NOTE: Localized versions of Windows (for languages other than English) need the
same entries in the Telephon.ini file. The only part of the entry that is
localized is the name of the country/region.

To update your Telephon.ini file to contain the latest country/region information
and dialing rules, follow these steps:

1. Create a backup copy of the Telephon.ini file by copying it to another name
  (such as Telephon.sav).

2. Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to open the Telephon.ini file in the
  Windows folder.

3. Delete the [Countries] section of the file, including the [Countries] header
  and all the "Country/Region" lines below it.

4. Insert the following [Countries] section into the Telephon.ini file and then
  save and close the file:

  the extra carriage return when you replace your [Countries] section.
