The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0 
- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0a 
- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to expand a project tree in Visual SourceSafe's Explorer window,
the Share dialog box may unexpectedly appear. This problem occurs under the
following circumstances:

- You are using Microsoft Windows 95 Operating System.

- The Project you are trying to expand contains one or more subprojects and at
  least 209 files.

- The Visual SourceSafe Explorer was last closed with one of the 209 files
  mentioned above having the focus.

- The Visual SourceSafe Explorer was last closed with the project containing
  the 209 files mentioned above in its open but unexpanded view. For example,
  its glyph is an open folder with a '+' sign to its left.

WORKAROUND
==========

Click the Cancel Command button to close the unwanted Share dialog box.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual SourceSafe
5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Open or switch to Microsoft Visual SourceSafe versions 4.0 or 4.0a running on
  Windows 95.

2. Using the Explorer window, create a project under the root project ($/)
  called "SOURCESAFEROCKS." Add 209 files and one additional subproject to the
  project.

3. Open the project in its unexpanded view by clicking its glyph so that the
  glyph is an open folder with a plus sign next to it. The right partition
  should now display the 209 files and subproject. Highlight any file in the
  right partition by clicking it once.

4. Close and then restart Visual SourceSafe. When the Explorer window reopens,
  click the glyph described in step 3. Note that the Share dialog box appears.
