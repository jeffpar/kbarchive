-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Issuing the following command causes a "Feature Not Available" message to appear
if QuickDraw GX is installed:

     REPORT FORM reportname TO FILE

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the ASCII clause on the above command or issue the following command:

     REPORT FORM reportname TO PRINTER PROMPT

In the Print dialog box that appears, select PostScript under destination. This
creates a file with embedded PostScript codes.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

QuickDraw GX is supplied with System 7.5.x. Install it by simply clicking the
Install QuickDraw GX icon in the Install System Software folder on the Apple
Macintosh CD-ROM. The Installation dialog box presents three choices: "Easy
Install," "Custom Install," and "Custom Remove." You can install or remove
QuickDraw via this dialog box.

After QuickDraw is installed, you can see a printer icon on the desktop for the
printer you were currently connected to under the old printing system. You can
go to the Chooser and set up other printer icons. Notice in Chooser that the
printers now have "GX" after their names. For each printer you set up, an icon
appears on the desktop.

QuickDraw GX may already be available on your system. If so, it is in the Apple
Extras folder.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Install QuickDraw GX.

2. Issue the following command in the Command window:

     SET DEFAULT TO SYS(2004)+"Samples:Data"

3. Create a report called "new" using the Customer table.

4. Issue the following command:

     REPORT FORM new TO FILE new.out
