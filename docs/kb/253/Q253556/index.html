SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Microsoft Windows on a computer where Microsoft Message Queue
(MSMQ) and the MSMQ - MQSeries Bridge are installed, the MSMQ - MQSeries Bridge
may not start properly. The following error message is posted to the Application
event log:

  

  C:\Program Files\MSMQ-MQSeries Bridge\Q2QGW.EXE (thread 212) -&gt;  
  ControlerThread: Error in e:\bridge40\falconmq\wing\q2q\q2qgw\q2qgw.cpp
  (from Thu Jun 24 15:07:19 1999), line 372 
  (compiled 12:20:16 on Aug 17 1999)
  &lt;&lt;Passing it on&gt;&gt;
  CQ2QControler::CQ2QControler: Error in
  e:\bridge40\falconmq\wing\q2q\q2qgw\q2qcntl.cpp (from Thu Jun 24 15:07:18
  1999), line 598 

  (compiled 12:20:04 on Aug 17 1999)
  &lt;&lt;Passing it on&gt;&gt;
  CreateOpenCntlQueues: Error in
  e:\bridge40\falconmq\wing\q2q\q2qgw\q2qcntl.cpp (from Thu Jun 24 15:07:18
  1999), line 101 

  (compiled 12:20:04 on Aug 17 1999)
  &lt;&lt;Passing it on&gt;&gt;
  CreateOpenCntlQueues: Error in
  e:\bridge40\falconmq\wing\q2q\q2qgw\q2qcntl.cpp (from Thu Jun 24 15:07:18
  1999), line 101 

  (compiled 12:20:04 on Aug 17 1999)
  &lt;&lt;MQCreateQueue failed - error = (c00e004a)
  MQ_ERROR_OBJECT_SERVER_NOT_AVAILABLE.&gt;&gt;

It is important to note that the last line in the log:

  MQ_ERROR_OBJECT_SERVER_NOT_AVAILABLE

may also occur as follows:

  MQ_ERROR_SERVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE
  MQ_ERROR_NO_DS

CAUSE
=====

The MSMQ service notifies the Service Control Manager that it is online, even
though it is not ready to take Message Queue Information Service requests. This
behavior is by design in order to allow any dependent services to start without
having to wait for the MSMQ service to complete its full initialization. This is
only a problem if a service that depends on the MSMQ needs to issue a Message
Queue Information Service request immediately.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With this fix installed, the MSMQ - MQSeries Bridge retries Message Queue
Information Service operations when an operation fails with one of the following
error messages:

  MQ_ERROR_OBJECT_SERVER_NOT_AVAILABLE
  MQ_ERROR_SERVICE_NOT_AVAILABLE
  MQ_ERROR_NO_DS

The default retry interval is one second, and three retries are attempted. This
interval can be changed by adding a new DWORD value named MQISRetryDelay to the
following registry key:

  HKLM\Software\Microsoft\MQBridge\Server

Set the value to the number of milliseconds that you want the server to wait
between retries.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
