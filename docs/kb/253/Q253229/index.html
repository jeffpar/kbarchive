-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you fill an NTFS volume to capacity, the volume may be marked "dirty",
even though Chkdsk finds no problems with the volume.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if an NTFS volume is filled to capacity in such a way that
the file system cannot allocate disk space for its own internal data structures.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT 4.0 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English-language version of this fix should have the following file
attributes or later:

  Date      Time       Size    File name     Platform
  ----------------------------------------------------
  02/02/2000  07:50p   363,056 ntfs.sys      i386
  02/02/2000  07:49p   556,368 ntfs.sys      alpha



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem does not result in data loss, but can result in unexpected and
unnecessary downtime. Because there is no way to determine the cause of the bit
having been set, you must run Autochk or Chkdsk in order to verify that the
volume is, in fact, clean.
