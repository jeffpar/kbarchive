A tree view is a way of presenting information in a hierarchical format that
looks like an upside-down tree. Like branches on a tree, the tree view has
branches of information that start from a root point. Individual points on the
tree stop at a leaf or split to form more branches or leaves. Each one of these
points on the tree is referred to as a node. A node can be a final point on a
branch or it can have its own set of nodes, called child nodes. Nodes that have
child nodes are referred to as parent nodes. The nodes located at the very top
of the tree view are referred to as root nodes. Root nodes do not have parent
nodes, but they can have sibling nodes (nodes located on the same branch).

The TreeView control contains, organizes, and presents Node objects in a tree
view. A Node object contains an index, key value, and text (or label). You must
specify a key value and text for the node. The key value must be a unique value
for that node in the collection. The index is created when you add a node to the
collection. If you want, you may include an ImageList control on the form
containing the TreeView control to specify images that may be used by TreeView.
This allows you to specify a default image, selected image, or an expanded image
for each node. The selected image appears for a node while that node in TreeView
has the focus. The expanded image appears when a parent node has been expanded
so that its child nodes are visible in TreeView.

The first node added to a tree view is a root node. Each node added after that
may be another root node or a node that has a relationship to a node that has
already been added. If you are adding a node that has a relationship, you are
required to specify the key value of the node to which the new node is related
and the relationship to that node. There are five types of relationships that
you may specify for a new node:

- Child - this creates the new node as a child node for the related node.

The following four relationship types create sibling nodes for the related node
and allow you to specify where the new node is placed in relationship to the
related node:

- First
- Last
- Next
- Previous

The default relationship is Next.
This example contains a project (TreeView) that contains two forms (TreeView,
AddNode) and six bitmap (.bmp) files. The TreeView form contains TreeView as
well as other controls that allow you to manipulate or view the properties of
the TreeView form as well as the currently selected node in TreeView. There are
ToolTips that help explain the purpose of the property that is being controlled
or displayed. There are also command buttons that contain code so that you may
see how to build the Nodes collection of TreeView, expand and collapse all the
nodes in the TreeView, plus add and remove nodes from the TreeView. There is
also an ImageList control so that you can see how to include images on the
TreeView. The second form (AddNode) provides a user interface to add nodes to
the TreeView. This allows you to try the five different types of relationships
for the new node.
