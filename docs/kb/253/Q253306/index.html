-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Migration Wizard to migrate all users from cc:Mail to Microsoft
Exchange Server, the cc:Mail mailboxes remain in the cc:Mail post office. When a
cc:Mail user sends a message to a user whose mailbox has been migrated, the
message goes to the cc:Mail mailbox instead of to the mailbox on Exchange
Server.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Migration Wizard does not remove mailboxes and their contents from the
cc:Mail system but copies them to Exchange Server and creates a mailbox for the
migrated recipient. When the migration is complete, custom recipients that are
associated with the cc:Mail mailbox for the same user are deleted. The new
Exchange mailbox now has two cc:Mail addresses:

- The primary address, displayed in bold formatting, is the user's Exchange
  Server address in cc:Mail format.

- The secondary address is the user's old cc:Mail address.

This allows mail addressed to the user from an outdated personal address book to
be successfully delivered.

To allow for recovery in case of a migration failure, the cc:Mail address for the
user is not deleted from the mail directory. No changes are made to the cc:Mail
data, and the old mailbox is not deleted from the cc:Mail post office.

After you confirm that the mailboxes are migrated successfully, manually remove
or delete the user from the cc:Mail post office. During the next directory
synchronization cycle, dirsync reports that a new Exchange user is created. Then
Import.exe creates an entry for the migrated user in the cc:Mail directory, and
mail is now delivered to the new Exchange Server mailbox.
