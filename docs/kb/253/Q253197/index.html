Keyword(s): kberrmsg kbsms120 kbsms120bug
Last Modified: 06-AUG-2002

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you distribute software to a Systems Management Server (SMS) client, the
following error message may be displayed when the advertisement runs:

  Runtime ERROR!
  Program \\server\smspkgd$\opl00003\mfctest.exe
  abnormal program termination

You may also see the following entry in the Smsapm32.log file:

  SCHED DATA : Attempting to execute
  \\SMSD4L8PDCUS\SMSPKGC$\RS100006\mfctest.exe' (SERVICE context)
  SCHED DATA : Command line "\\SMSD4L8PDCUS\SMSPKGC$\RS100006\mfctest.exe" CWD
  "\\SMSD4L8PDCUS\SMSPKGC$\RS100006\"

  SCHED DATA : Return code = 0x3; The system cannot find the path specified.~~;
  Program '\\SMSD4L8PDCUS\SMSPKGC$\RS100006\mfctest.exe' terminated with exit
  code = 3.

On the client, the program (the .exe file) may have a status of "Started" in Task
Manager, even though it is no longer active.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Setup file that is used by the advertised program
uses the Msvcrt.dll run-time library file from Microsoft Visual C++, and if one
of the following options is enabled on the Environment tab in the program
properties:

- Run with administrative rights

- Use Windows NT client software installation account

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The International Client Pack 5 (ICP5) version of this fix should have the
following file attributes or later:

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, do not enable the Run with administrative rights
or "Use Windows NT client software installation account" option.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, use either of the following methods.

Method 1: Using the Hotfix Installer
------------------------------------

NOTE: This method only works on I386-based computers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a share on your network. The Q253197.exe
  file is a Microsoft Windows Installer file that updates specific files on
  your site server.

2. Log on to your site server using an account with administrative privileges.

3. On the site server, close the SMS Administrator console.

4. Start Q253197.exe and follow the directions in the wizard. You can run the
  program in Quiet mode by using the /s switch.

Method 2: Manual Installation
-----------------------------

NOTE: You can use this method for both I386-based and Alpha-based site servers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a local subfolder on your site server or
  to a share on your network.

2. Close the SMS Administrator console and stop all SMS services.

3. Copy the following files from the hotfix I386 folder into the
  &lt;Sms_root_folder&gt;\Sms\Bin\I386 folder:

  Abnwcli.dll
  Bindclin.dll
  Ccim32.dll
  Clisvcl.exe
  Falclin.dll
  Mslmclin.dll
  Ndsclin.dll
  Smsapm32.exe

4. If Alpha-based support is enabled on the primary site, copy the following
  files from the hotfix Alpha folder into the
  &lt;Sms_root_folder&gt;\Sms\Bin\Alpha folder:

  Abnwcli.dll
  Ccim32.dll
  Clisvcl.exe
  Falclin.dll
  Mslmclin.dll
  Smsapm32.exe

5. Copy the following files from the appropriate platform subfolder into the
  &lt;Sms_root_folder&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base\&lt;platform &gt;folder:

  Ccmcore.exe
  Clicore.exe

6. Copy the Apasetup.exe file from the appropriate platform subfolder into the
  &lt;Sms_root_folder&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Smsapm32\&lt;platform&gt;
  folder.

7. Copy the updated Compver.ini file to the
  &lt;Sms_root_folder&gt;\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Smsapm32 folder.

8. Copy the updated Compver.ini file to the
  &lt;Sms_root_folder&gt;\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base folder.
