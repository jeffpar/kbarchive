-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0, 4.0 SP6a 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP5, Terminal Server Edition

SYMPTOMS
========

If you type a preferred NetWare server name that is preceded by a asterisk (*)
but has no following backslash (\) and path, access violations may occur in
services.

CAUSE
=====

When the preferred server is checked, the asterisk typically means that there
will be a backslash following the name (for example:
*&lt;server&gt;\&lt;name&gt;). Windows assumes that there will be a backslash
and some text. Making this assumption causes Windows to access a null pointer.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Windows NT 4.0 service pack that contains
this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:
