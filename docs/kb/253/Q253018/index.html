-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you set up the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes in an
environment where Exchange Server sends and receives all internet mail, the
Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes may append the From address with
"@SMTP@" along with the domain name configured in the "Exchange domain in Notes"
field on the connector. For example, @SMTP@Exchange if "Exchange" is the domain
name specified in the field above.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because earlier versions of the Exchange Connector for
Lotus Notes needed to append the address to properly resolve the address and
send the message through the Internet Mail Service to the Internet. Now that the
Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes can determine an Internet address by the way
the address is formed, this appendage is no longer necessary.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, click the article number below to view the article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To enable this new capability, add the following parameter to the
[LME-NOTES-MEXOUT] section of the Exchconn.ini file:

  INCAPSULATESMTP=NO

The default setting of this parameter is "YES." When this parameter is set to
YES, the Exchange Connector for Lotus Notes functions as it did before the fix
was applied.
