-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print your label document, your labels may not print correctly on your
label sheet after the first page of labels.

For example, the labels after the first page may print higher on each label page.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because with some label formats, Word uses a blank table row
as a separator between one row of labels and the next row. As a result, when you
press the TAB key to create the next row of labels, Word only creates a new row
exactly the same as the row in which you are pressing the TAB key. Word does not
add the separator row between label rows.

This problem is known to occur with the following labels:

- Avery 5366 File Folder
- Avery 8366 File Folder


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

Method 1: Copy and Paste First Page Labels to Other Pages
---------------------------------------------------------

Use this method if you need more than one page of labels and before you begin
typing text into your labels.

NOTE: These steps use the Avery 5366 File Folder label as an example.

1. On the Tools menu, click Envelopes and Labels.

2. On the Labels tab, click Options.

3. In the Labels Options dialog box, click the type of label you want to use,
  and then click OK.

  For example, click the Avery 5366 File Folder label.

4. In the Envelopes and Labels dialog box, click New Document. Word creates a
  new, one-page label document.

5. To create the additional pages of labels you need, follow these steps:

  a. On the Table menu, click Select Table.

  b. On the Edit menu, click Copy.

  c. Move the insertion point to the last label in your label document, and
     then press the TAB key until a new label row appears on the next page.

  d. On the new label page, select the new label row. To do this, click Select
     Row on the Table menu.

  e. On the Edit menu, click Paste Rows.

  f. Repeat steps c through e for each new label page you want.

Method 2: Adjust the Label Settings for the Second and Remaining Pages
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Use this method if you already created pages of labels and are experiencing the
problem as described in the "Symptoms" section of this article:

NOTE: These steps use the Avery 5366 File Folder label as an example.

1. On the first page of labels, click inside the first label.

2. On the Tools menu, click Envelopes and Labels.

3. On the Labels tab, click Options.

4. In the Label Options dialog box, make sure the correct label is selected in
  the Product number list, and then click Details.

5. Record the value listed in the Vertical pitch box. Then click Cancel.

  For example, in the details of the Avery 5366 File Folder label, the Vertical
  pitch is listed as 0.67".

  IMPORTANT: Write this value down, because you will use this value in step 10.

6. Click Cancel to close the Label Options dialog box.

7. Click Cancel to close the Envelopes and Labels dialog box.

8. On page 2 of your label document, select the first row of labels. Then extend
  the selection to include the remaining rows of labels on page 2 and the
  remaining pages of your label document.

  NOTE: Be sure not to select the labels on page 1 of your label document.

9. On the Table menu, click Cell Height and Width.

10. On the Row tab, change the Height of rows box to Exactly, and type the value
  of the Vertical pitch from step 5 in the At box.

  For example, type "0.67"" (without the quotation marks) and then click OK.

11. On page 2 of your label document, click into the first label of the first
  row of labels. Do not click into a label that is contained on the first page
  of your label document.

12. Right-click the label.

13. On the shortcut menu that appears, point to Alignment and click Align Top.

14. Repeat steps 12 through 13 for each of the remaining labels in your label
  document. Do not perform steps 12 through 13 on any label that is contained
  on the first page of your label document.

  NOTE: This step causes your label text for page 2 and the remaining label
  pages of your label document to shift to the top of the label. You may need
  to adjust the text downward a little by adding a blank line (or adding
  spacing) above the text on each label.

15. On the File menu, click Save to save the changes you made to your label
  document.
