-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 SP4, on platform(s):
   - the operating system: Mac OS (ALL) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Package Command Manager for the Macintosh (PCMMAC) is running the same job
on multiple clients simultaneously, the following error message may be
displayed:

  "error 0 in file array s.cpp".

In addition, the job may be displayed in the Systems Management Server (SMS)
Administrator console as being successfully completed, when the job has not
actually run correctly on the workstation.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Systems Management Server service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English-language version of this fix should have the following file
attributes or later:

  Date        Time      Size    File name    Platform
  ----------------------------------------------------
  2/4/2000    12:07PM   306K    Pcm.mac      Macintosh
  2/4/2000    6:56PM    191K    Pcmupd.mac   Macintosh

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that
contains the above files may also contain additional files.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Pcm.mac file is a compressed version of PCMMAC. Use the Hdecomp tool
included with SMS to decompress this file to a volume that supports Macintosh
files (such as NTFS).

The Pcmupd.mac file is a compressed version of a special Vise updater bundle
containing PCMMAC. Use the Hdecomp tool to extract this file, which generates a
Pcmupdater file. Run the resulting file to view its Readme file, and then apply
the update to the local computer.
