-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you cannot restart the directory service on Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0
after it stops for no apparent reason, you may receive an error message citing
internal error -1811, with ID: 203017d.

The application log of Event Viewer may display the following events:

  Event ID: 1166
  Source: MSExchangeDS
  Type: Information
  Category: Internal Processing
  Error -1811 has occurred. JET_errFileNotFound. Internal ID 203017d. Contact
  Microsoft Technical Support for assistance.

  Event ID: 1002
  Source: MSExchangeDS
  Type: Error
  Category: Internal Processing
  Description: The Microsoft Exchange Server database, EDB, could not be
  initialized and returned error -1811. Unrecoverable error. The directory
  can't continue.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the directory service cannot find the directory
databases it requires to start, or when the directory (Dir.edb) is damaged.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, change the paths for the directory logs and databases
if the paths are incorrect. If this does not resolve the behavior, restore the
directory from tape backup.

1. On the server properties page dialog box, click the Database Paths tab and
  verify that the paths for directory logs and databases are correct.

2. If the paths for logs and databases are incorrect, run Performance Optimizer
  (Perfwiz.exe) to change to the recommended paths:

  a. To start Performance Optimizer, click Start on the taskbar, point to
     Programs, point to Microsoft Exchange, and then click Microsoft Exchange
     Optimizer.

  b. The initial page of Performance Optimizer indicates that it stops all
     Exchange Server services. To accept, click Next. If you do not want
     Performance Optimizer to stop the Exchange Server services, click Cancel
     to quit Performance Optimizer.

  c. Follow the directions provided by Performance Optimizer until you reach
     the page that lists the data placement options. Accept the suggested
     changes by clicking Next, or manually enter the paths and then click Next.

  d. Confirm that the Move Files Automatically check box is selected by
     default, and then click Next. If you do not want Performance Optimizer to
     move your files at this time, click to clear the check box, and then click
     Next.

  e. Continue to click Next until you complete the program, and then click
     Finish to restart all Exchange Server services. If you select the Do not
     restart these services check box, Performance Optimizer will not restart
     any Exchange Server services.

3. If the directory service does not start, restore the directory from a tape
  backup. If you do not have a valid backup or a copy of the original Dir.edb
  file, you must perform full disaster recovery by removing and reinstalling
  Microsoft Exchange Server.
