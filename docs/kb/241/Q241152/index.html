The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You may need to run an Exchange Server directory service database in a lab
environment, or to send a database to Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS)
for testing and troubleshooting. Because the directory service database is
linked to the Exchange Server service account, running it "out of place" can be
inconvenient because its associated Microsoft Windows NT service account domain
must be available.

Alternately, you can "unsecure" the database and then reassociate it with an
unrelated domain and service account. Unsecuring a directory service database
removes the link between the database and any Windows NT domain security. After
you unsecure a directory service database, anyone with physical access to it can
read it, so you must carefully control unsecured copies.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can unsecure a directory service database by removing all Windows NT account
permissions from the following three "root" security objects in the directory:

- &lt;Organization Name&gt;

- &lt;Site Name&gt;

- Configuration

Removing all permissions from any of these objects makes the container completely
unsecure, rather than completely inaccessible. If you remove all permissions,
the following message is displayed:

  You have removed all security from this object, allowing anybody to modify
  it. Are you sure you want to do this? (Yes, No)

These three objects are the roots of three independent security "contexts" in the
Exchange Server directory. Inheritance of permissions from above in the
directory tree is blocked at the root object for each context.

This means a given account can have complete rights over the &lt;Site Name&gt;
container, but still have no rights at all for the Configuration container.
Rights granted on a root object flow to all its subobjects. Any account with
permissions on all three of the root objects inherits permissions on every
object in the Exchange Server directory, including the Schema and Address Book
Views objects. (Schema permissions are inherited from the Configuration object,
and Address Book Views permissions are inherited from the &lt;Site Name&gt;
object.

Be aware that removing permissions using the Exchange Server Administrator
program is different than deleting accounts with permissions using Windows NT
User Manager. If you delete all accounts with permissions using Windows NT User
Manager, the Exchange Server directory service database becomes inaccessible to
anyone.

IMPORTANT: It is safe to delete all accounts with permissions using the Exchange
Server Administrator program, but unsafe to do so using Windows NT User
Manager.

If you unsecure an Exchange Server directory service database while it is live on
the network, it replicates the change to all other Exchange Server computers in
the site, effectively unsecuring all the servers. To prevent this, follow this
procedure (which requires direct physical access to the server console):

1. Run the Exchange Server Administrator program, click to expand the &lt;Site
  Name&gt; container, click to expand the Configuration container, and then
  click to expand the Servers container, to access the properties of the server
  on which the Exchange Server directory service database is to be unsecured.
  On the Database Paths property page, note the directory service paths. There
  are three paths, some or all of which may be identical.

2. Stop the directory service and verify that the directory service database
  file is consistent. To do this, at a command prompt, run:

  eseutil /mh dir.edb | more

  Look for the line:

  State: Consistent

  If the state is inconsistent, do not proceed.

  NOTE: For Exchange Server 5.0 and 4.0, run Edbutil rather than Eseutil.

3. Rename each of the database folders noted in Step 1 above to
  Exchsvr\Dsadata_sav. Then create new Dsadata folders to replace the ones you
  just renamed.

4. Copy the Dir.edb file from Dsadata_sav to the corresponding Dsadata folder.

5. Start the directory service. After startup finishes, physically disconnect
  the server from the network, or otherwise ensure that there is no
  communication between it and any other Exchange Server computer.

  You may want to disable the directory service in Control Panel by
  double-clicking Services, and then clicking Startup. This does not stop the
  service if it is currently running, but prevents it from starting later
  without your intervention.

  Do not disconnect the server from the network before you start the directory
  service. If you do, and there are many other servers in your organization,
  startup may be greatly delayed while this server tries to communicate with
  the other servers.

6. Unsecure the directory service database by running the Exchange Server
  Administrator program on the server console, and removing all permissions
  from the &lt;Organization Name&gt;, &lt;Site Name&gt;, and Configuration
  objects.

7. Stop the directory service.

  If the directory service takes a long time to stop, you can use a utility,
  such as Kill.exe, from the Windows NT Resource Kit to forcibly stop the
  process (at a command prompt, type "kill dsamain.exe" (without the quotation
  marks)). You can also perform a normal shutdown of the server, and then
  restart it if you have previously disabled the directory service in Control
  Panel.

8. After you stop the directory service, at a command prompt, run "eseutil /mh"
  (without the quotation marks) again to ensure that the database file is
  consistent. Look for the line:

  State: Consistent

  If the state is inconsistent, at a command prompt, run:

  eseutil /r /ds

  Use the exact command line shown above. Do not substitute Dir.edb for /ds. The
  /r switch runs "soft recovery." Soft recovery may succeed, but still may not
  bring the database back to a consistent state. After soft recovery is
  finished, whether or not it reports success, check the database again for
  consistency using /mh.

  If the directory service database file is still not consistent, the process
  has failed. Follow the next two steps to restore the directory to its
  previous state, and consult PSS for further advice.

9. Rename the current Dsadata folders to Dsadata_uns, and then rename the
  Dsadata_sav folders back to Dsadata.

10. Connect the server back to the network and start the directory service (if
  you previously disabled the service, reenable it).

11. Preserve the Dir.edb file from the Dsadata_uns folder, and discard all other
  Dsadata_uns files.

The unsecured Dir.edb database is now ready to be transported to another Exchange
Server installation, and does not need its previous service account or service
account domain.

You can run this database on another Exchange Server installation where:

- The Windows NT server name is identical.

- The organization name and site name are identical.

- Revision and service pack levels are the same as the original server.

To run the unsecured directory in the new installation:

1. Stop the directory service.

2. Remove all existing files from the Dsadata folders.

3. Copy the unsecured Dir.edb into the appropriate Dsadata folder.

4. Start the directory service.

5. Secure the directory by adding the service account chosen at Exchange Server
  installation to the &lt;Organization Name&gt;, &lt;Site Name&gt;, and
  Configuration containers.

You must resecure the database, not only to protect it from unauthorized access,
but also to restore full functionality for all Exchange Server services. The
directory must be secure for some functions to work.

The information store service may not start and logs a 1011 error. This does not
indicate a problem with the database, but simply that the directory and
information store are not synchronized. To correct this, at a command prompt,
run:

  c:\exchsrvr\bin\isinteg -patch

Start the information store service again.
