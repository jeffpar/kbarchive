SYMPTOMS
========

When using IIS IP and Domain Restrictions to deny clients by a specific domain
name, a client with an IP address that IIS cannot resolve will still be allowed
to connect. The client may request content over this connection for the duration
of the session. If the client makes a request over a different connection, it
will be properly denied, and will receive a 403 error that the IP address is not
allowed.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
