SUMMARY
=======

Launching the Open File dialog box in Visual C++ using the keyboard shortcut key
or from the File menu results in the following error:

  Access Violation (0xC0000005) in DEVSHL.DLL at 0x5003eaed.
  DevShl.Dll referenced memory at 0x0000000. The memory could not be read.

The same error occurs when you select Add to Project from the Project menu and
click Files.

FileTool.exe is a sample that replaces the Open and Add to Project menu items in
Visual C++ using the Developer Studio Object Model.

The Developer Studio Object Model contains methods that both open files and add
files to a project. The BuildProject object contains an AddFile method that adds
files to a project. The Documents object contains an Open method that can open
files into Developer Studio. These can be used in either a macro or Add-In.

secure servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

Installing the Add-In
---------------------

1. Run FileTool.Exe to extract the Visual C++ 6.0 project.

2. Build the project in Visual C++ in Release or Debug configuration.

3. In Visual C++, click Customize from the Tools menu.

4. In the Customize dialog box, click the Add-Ins and Macro Files tab.

5. Click the Browse button and locate the FileTool.dll file that was built in
  step 2.

6. Click OK to save the settings.

A toolbar for the two commands appears.

NOTE: Only the Open command works in Visual C++ 5.0. The AddFile method was added
with the Visual Studio 6.0 release.

Removing Shortcut Keys
----------------------

After you load the add-in, you can remove the shortcut keys for the menu items
that stop Visual C++ and assign them to the two add-in commands by following the
steps below:

1. From the Visual C++ Tools menu, click Customize.

2. In the Customize dialog box, click the Keyboard tab.

3. From the Category box select File.

4. In the Commands window, select FileOpen.

5. In the Current keys window, select the CTRL+O entry and then click Remove.

6. From the Category box select Project.

7. In the Commands window, select InsertFilesIntoProject. If there is a shortcut
  associated with it, follow step 5 to remove it. By default there is no
  shortcut key for this item.

8. From the Category box select Add-Ins.

9. The two add-in commands AddFileToProject and OpenFile appear in the Commands
  window.

10. Select OpenFile then put the cursor in the Press New Shortcut Key box, press
  the shortcut key or key combination that you want, and click Assign.

11. Repeat the above step for the other command. The assigned shortcut keys for
  the two commands appear in the Current Keys window.

You may also wish to remove the menu commands and insert the AddIn commands in
their place. To insert the new AddIn commands in the MenuBar, use the following
steps:

1. From the Visual C++ Tools menu, click Customize.

2. Click the File menu and then drag the Open command off of the File popup and
  release it.

3. Click the Project menu, click Add To Project and then drag the Files command
  off of the popup and release it.

4. In the Customize dialog box, select the Commands tab.

5. Select Add-ins from the Category list box.

6. Drag the OpenFile command to the File menu and drop it in the space vacated
  by the Open command.

7. Drag the AddFileToProject command to the Add To Project item on the Project
  menu and drop it in the space vacated by the Files command.

When the menus have been modified as above, it is not necessary to have the AddIn
toolbar visible.
