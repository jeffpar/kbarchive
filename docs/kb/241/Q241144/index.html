SUMMARY
=======

ARCserve Storage Suite for Small Business Server by Computer Associates
International, is not compatible with Small Business Server 4.5. This program is
intended to run only on Small Business Server 4.0/4.0a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you were running ARCserve on Small Business Server 4.0 and upgraded to Small
Business Server 4.5, you may have problems starting the ARCserve backup
services. You may receive an error message that you do not have enough ARCserve
licenses to start the services. You receive this error message because ARCserve
is not detecting the correct number of Client Access Licenses installed for
Small Business Server.

Associates technical support at 1-800-243-9462 or visit their Web site at:
