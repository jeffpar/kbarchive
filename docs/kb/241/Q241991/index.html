-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A TN3270 emulator display screen may contain corrupted data and characters. The
display screen appears correctly using a 3270 emulator.

Note: This particular problem does not occur when you use 802.2 DLC and SDLC
connections to the host. Host connections that use other types of link services
(for example, Channel) may experience this problem.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server TN3270 service is an RUI Application. If an RUI application
issues an RUI_READ request, but the RUI library (Winrui32.dll) has more data to
return than can fit in the calling application's buffer (as specified in
lua_max_length), Winrui32.dll returns a primary return code of LUA_OK and a
secondary return code of LUA_DATA_INCOMPLETE. When the RUI application issues a
subsequent RUI_READ to pick up the remaining data, the data may be corrupted.
This data corruption can occur in Winrui32.dll if the "FMI" (3270 message) data
received from the SNA Server computer occurs in a certain sequence.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to

support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
