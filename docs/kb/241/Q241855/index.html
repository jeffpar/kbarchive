-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server information store may not start, or, if it is
already running, it may stop responding. The following event may be logged:

  Event ID: 145
  Source: ESE97
  Category: General
  Description: MSExchangeIS ((%pid%) ) The database engine could not access the
  file called %database path%\edb.log.

The file that the event lists may be any file in the database folder.

CAUSE
=====

A program has the file that the event lists locked open. Backup and antivirus
software may lock files open. To verify that the file is locked open:

1. Log on to the Exchange Server computer using the administrator account.

2. Create a Test folder on drive C.

3. At a command prompt, type the following:

  copy &lt;database path&gt;\edb.log c:\test

The file is locked open if the following error message is displayed:

  The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another
  process.

RESOLUTION
==========

Configure the AV, backup or other software so that it does not directly access
any of the data files on the Exchange server. It is recommended that you exclude
all \exchsrvr directories from being scanned by file-based virus scanning
software. Exchange aware virus scanning software do not access the files
directly and do not cause this problem.

If you intend to backup the Exchange server files, stop all of the Exchange
services first. You can use an Exchange aware backup product to back up the
Exchange databases while online without causing any file contention problems.
