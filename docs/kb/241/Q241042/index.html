-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following symptoms may occur:

- When a user logs on to a computer running Windows NT 4.0, a profile other
  than the user's assigned profile may be loaded and may run malicious files
  placed in the StartUp folder. The user may be unaware that the profile
  substitution has taken place.

- A normal domain user can add his or her account to the Domain Administrators
  group and obtain the permissions of that group by copying the profile to a
  self-deleting batch file and specifying the path to that file in the
  ProfileImagePath value in the Administrator's ProfileList key. The next time
  someone uses the Administrator account and password to log on, the batch file
  runs and adds that user's profile to the Domain Administrators group.

- Users may be able to bypass mandatory profiles.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs in Windows NT 4.0 because the registry key listed below
grants the SetValue permission to the Everyone group by default, so that any
user (even guests) can edit the information in the ProfileList registry key and
its subkeys:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList

Editing these keys can be performed locally or remotely, and setting permissions
in the Access Control List (ACL) on the Winreg key (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System)
does not limit remote access because the path to the CurrentVersion key is an
allowed path and can be edited regardless of the permissions assigned to the
Winreg key.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT Server or Workstation 4.0
------------------------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or the
individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
pack, please go to:

- http://www.microsoft.com/Windows/ServicePacks/

-or-

- Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack

For information on obtaining the individual software update, contact Microsoft
Product Support Services. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support
Services phone numbers and information on support costs, please go to the
following address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS


When you apply Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6 (SP6), the default permission on the
Everyone group is set to read access only. Also, the process created by
Winlogon.exe creates the user's Security Identifier (SID) subkey in the System
account, instead of under the CurrentVersion key, and then writes the necessary
values to the ProfileList key.

Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
----------------------------------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack
