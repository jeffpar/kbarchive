The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP) client is issued an
&lt;x&gt;.&lt;x&gt;.&lt;x&gt;.0 address from a DHCP server on which the scope
allows for a valid &lt;x&gt;.&lt;x&gt;.&lt;x&gt;.0 address (even though another
address may be excluded) and receives the address successfully as an active DHCP
client, the DHCP client's network connectivity may not function properly. Error
messages may be generated when the DHCP client, or other network resources or
services, attempt to establish a network connection.

You may see the following error message when other network resources or services
try to communicate across the network with the DHCP client:

  Destination specified is invalid

You may see the following error message when the DHCP client attempts to
establish a connection with other network resources:

  Request timed out

CAUSE
=====

Although the DHCP client receives the address from the DHCP server, the address
it receives is viewed as a "network address" instead of a client address on the
network. The use of the &lt;x&gt;.&lt;x&gt;.&lt;x&gt;.0 address is disallowed as
a client address even though it is a valid host address.

RESOLUTION
