-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the "subst" command to assign a drive letter to a third-tier
directory on a Microsoft Windows NT computer (see "Example" in this section of
the article), the local Systems Management Server accounts SMSCliToknAcct&amp;
and SMSCCMBootAcct&amp; do not correctly attempt connection over the network,
which can cause a lockout of the account.

Example:

  g=\\&lt;server&gt;\&lt;share&gt;, subst h=g:\&lt;directory&gt;

CAUSE
=====

During a Windows NT Remote client installation, the client uses the
SMSCCMBootAcct&amp; account. During software or hardware inventory, the client
uses the SMSCliToknAcct&amp; account. These accounts only exist for the local
use of the clients. Because the domain controllers share an accounts database,
the domain controllers also share these accounts. If either of these accounts is
used on the network, the accounts will be recognized, but the passwords will be
incorrect. This causes the lockout of the account in the domain.

Some organizations may use the subst command in logon scripts to have the
equivalent of a Novell MapRoot command, such as:

  net use g:\\&lt;server&gt;\&lt;share&gt;
  subst h: g:\&lt;username&gt;

The lockouts do not occur if you do not use the "subst" command.

RESOLUTION

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server that contains
this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English Service Pack 3 (SP3) version of this fix should have the following
file attributes or later:

  Date         Time   Version        Size     File Name        Platform

WORKAROUND
==========

Do not use the "subst" command.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

NOTE: As of SMS 2.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4), the software inventory agent no longer
causes incorrect account usage due to substituted drives. However, the remaining
issues with client installation and hardware inventory may still occur.
