-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Connector for Novell GroupWise may not correctly add
Exchange Server users to the GroupWise mail system. This only applies to an
update directory synchronization (dirysnc) cycle and not to the full reload
dirsync cycle. Possible reasons include:

- The Exchange Server user was recently marked unhidden from the global address
  list.

- The GroupWise proxy address was recently added to Exchange Server users.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange Connector for Novell GroupWise does not send the correct dirsync
transactions to GroupWise under certain conditions (some are listed above).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 3. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server
5.5 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The update dirsync process sends changes to the GroupWise system based on any
change in the USN-Changed field for Exchange Server recipients. If an Exchange
Server recipient is created and then hidden from the Exchange Server directory,
the recipient is not added to GroupWise during dirsync. If this recipient is
unhidden, the USN-Changed field causes a modify transaction to be sent to the
GroupWise system. Because this user does not exist in GroupWise, the modify
transaction is rejected, which results in an incomplete dirsync cycle.

The workaround is to send an additional add transaction with each modify
transaction during the dirsync cycle. This ensures that new users are added, and
any changes to existing users are modified in the GroupWise system.
