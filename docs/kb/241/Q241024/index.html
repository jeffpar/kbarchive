The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

Macintosh clients may experience slow performance when they attempt to gain
access to files on a Windows NT server running Services for Macintosh (SFM) if
other clients are using AppleScripts to query for files on the server.

CAUSE
=====

A program that uses AppleScript to use the Apple File Protocol (AFP) CatSearch
command (such as Macintosh File Find) may reduce the server's responsiveness to
other Macintosh clients on the network, causing them to appear to stop
responding (hang) for brief periods of time. This problem occurs only when there
is a large number of Macintosh clients connected to a Macintosh volume that
contains a very large number of files and folders.

If the AppleScript program is written to use a CatSearch command, it ignores the
"DisableCatSearch=1" setting, which indicates that no CatSearch commands are
allowed. Setting the "DisableCatSearch=1" setting in the registry disables
Macintosh clients from using CatSearch commands, but not custom programs that
use AppleScripts.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem.

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information on support costs, please go to the following address on the World
Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English-language version of this fix should have the following file
attributes or later:

  Date      Time                 Size    File name     Platform
  -------------------------------------------------------------
  09/28/99  11:49a              134,416  Sfmsrv.sys    x86
  09/28/99  11:48a              241,744  Sfmsrv.sys    Alpha



To Disable CatSearch Commands for All Clients on an SFM Volume
--------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

NOTE: This change is only valid on systems running Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2
or later.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the volume on which you want to disable CatSearch commands under the
  following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MacFile\Parameters\Volumes

3. On the Edit menu, click Multi String, type "DisableCatSearch=1" (without the
  quotation marks), and then click OK.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

5. Stop and then restart SFM.

NOTE: In Windows 2000 the administrator applies only the Registry setting to
enable this option. In Windows NT 4.0 the adminstrator must apply the binaries
and the registry entry.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This new functionality gives administrators the ability to turn off the
CatSearch command. If this feature is disabled, AppleScript-based programs may
not work. For additional information, click the article number below to view the
