-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Outlook to create and send a mail message, you receive one of the
following:

- A non-delivery report (NDR) that points to the wrong user. When you resend
  the message it is addressed to the correct user. This is only a display
  issue.

- A delivery receipt (DR) that has the To and Cc recipients exchanged in the
  body.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When Outlook modifies the recipient list during creation of a message, it
re-sorts the recipient list internally. The Exchange Server Message Transfer
Agent (MTA) does not interpret the list correctly.

This behavior occurs when two Exchange Server computers are connected by an X.400
Connector with the default parameters, except that the "Allow MS Exchange
Contents" and "Two Way Alternate" check boxes are cleared.
