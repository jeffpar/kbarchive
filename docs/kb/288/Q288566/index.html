-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running a session-level interface (SLI) application designed for
using asynchronous verb completion against the SNA Server/Host Integration
Server 2000 versions listed at the beginning of this article, the SLI
application may "hang" indefinitely.

CAUSE
=====

The SLI Library incorrectly sets the parameter lua_flag2.async, indicating that
the logical units for applications (LUA) interface verb completed
asynchronously, even if in fact it completed synchronously.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 4.0
--------------

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0 service pack that contains this
fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

+------------------------------------+
| File name    | Date     | Time     | 
+------------------------------------+
| Winsli32.dll | 02/02/01 | 02:05 pm | 
+------------------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.



Host Integration Server 2000
----------------------------

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server versions
4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, and 4.0 SP4 and Host Integration Server 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following annotated SNA Server LUA API trace (CLIAPIx.ATF) statement shows
an example of the problem described in this article.

NOTE: See the LUA Programmer's Guide in the SNA Server or Host Integration Server
2000 SDK for details on the format of the following SLI verb.

  

  SLI_BID response
  OK - OK
  ---- Verb Parameter Block at address 004884C0 ----
52005000 00000000 00000000 06000000     &lt;R.P.............&gt;
         ****
00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000     &lt;................&gt;
40426D00 00000C00 00000000 2D000000     &lt;@Bm.........-...&gt;
2C000901 022C0231 001F0141 00000000     &lt;,....,.1...A....&gt;
                        ^^
00000000 40404040 40404040 40404040     &lt;....@@@@@@@@@@@@&gt;

The SLI_BID response incorrectly set the lua_flag2.async value (denoted by ^^ in
the trace) to 0x'41', indicating asynchronous verb completion. However, this
particular verb completed synchronously, causing the primary return code to be
set to 0000, OK (denoted by ****), rather then 0030, IN_PROGRESS. Therefore, the
application waits indefinitely for final completion and never submits a
subsequent SLI_RECEIVE command to read the data.
