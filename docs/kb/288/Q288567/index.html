-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you update a collection manually in the Systems Management Server (SMS)
Administrator console by clicking Update Collection Membership, the resulting
collection update (.psd) file that is sent to the secondary site does not
contain any subcollection information. However, when the same collection is
updated by the Monitor Collections thread of the SMS Executive service at the
scheduled interval, the collection update file contains the correct
subcollection data.

This behavior causes advertisements that are made to subcollections through the
relationship to the parent collection not to work until the collection is
updated according to its defined update schedule.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The SMS 2.0 post-Service Pack 2 (SP2) version of this fix should have the
following file attributes or later:

  Date         Time   Version         Size     File name     Platform
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  10-Jun-2000  20:15  2.00.1493.2201  145,168  Colleval.dll  Alpha
  10-Jun-2000  20:15  2.00.1493.2201   90,000  Colleval.dll  I386

The SMS 2.0 post-Service Pack 3 (SP3) version of this fix should have the
following file attributes or later:

  Date         Time   Version         Size     File name     Platform
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  01-Mar-2001  10:05  2.00.1493.3138  145,168  Colleval.dll  Alpha
  01-Mar-2001  10:05  2.00.1493.3138   90,000  Colleval.dll  I386

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that
contains these files may also contain additional files.



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, make sure to define an update schedule for the
collection. To minimize the effects of the problem, do not update the collection
by using the SMS Administrator console.
