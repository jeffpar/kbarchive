-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 SP4 
- ActiveX Data Objects (ADO), versions 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set a recordset to use client-side cursor and the BatchOptimistic lock
type, there is no update to the database until you call the UpdateBatch method.
However, if the DataGrid is bound to the DataEnvironment object, it does not
work as expected. Any update to the DataGrid sends to the database immediately
without the UpdateBatch method being called even if you have set the command's
properties accordingly.

CAUSE
=====

The problem is caused by the Microsoft Environment Instance 1.0 component
(Msderun.dll), which does not handle such situations correctly. The problem only
occurs on Msderun.dll version 6.0.88.4 that is shipped with Microsoft Visual
Studio 6.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4). The problem does not occur on Msderun.dll
version 6.0.0.3005 that is shipped with Visual Studio 6.0) or version 6.0.84.50
that is shipped with Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3).

RESOLUTION
==========

One workaround is to use Microsoft ADO Data Control (ADODC) or ActiveX Data
Object ADO) recordset object as the data source of the DataGrid instead of using
the DataEnvironment and command, as follows:

1. Create a new Visual Basic project, add the DataGrid control, and then add an
  ADO Data Control, ADODC1.

2. Configure the ADO Data Control to use the Microsoft Jet 4.0 OLE DB Provider,
  and choose the Nwind.mdb database file. (The database file is shipped with
  Visual Basic 6.0, and the typical directory is C:\Program Files\Microsoft
  Visual Studio\VB98\NWIND.MDB.)

3. Set the LockType property of ADODC1 to 4-adLockBatchOptimistic.

4. On the newly added ADO Data Control, click the RecordSource tab of Property
  Pages, and then choose Products Table.

5. Configure the DataGrid control's DataSource to adodc1.

6. Run the project.

7. Modify the value in the cell of the first row, second column (ProductName).

8. Click another cell in the DataGrid, and note that the change is not updated
  to the database without calling the UpdateBatch method.

NOTE: Verify the change by rerunning the program.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem is not related to MDAC and OLE DB Provider. Both OLE DB Provider for
SQL Server and OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers can be used to reproduce the
problem.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Visual Basic project, add the DataGrid control, and then add
  DataEnvironment.

2. Configure the DataEnvironment to use the Microsoft Jet 4.0 OLE DB Provider,
  and choose database file Nwind.mdb. (The database file is shipped with Visual
  Basic 6.0 and the typical directory is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual
  Studio\VB98\NWIND.MDB.)

3. Create a new command, such as products, to open a table.

4. Open the newly created Command Property dialog box, and click the Advanced
  tab. Be sure to set the command to use client-side cursor and BatchOptimistic
  lock type.

5. Configure the DataGrid control's DataSource and DataMemeber properties to the
  DataEnvironment and the command.

6. Run the project.

7. Modify the value in the cell of first row, second column (ProductName).

8. Click another cell in the DataGrid, and note that the change is updated to
  the database without calling UpdateBatch.

NOTE: Verify the change by rerunning the program.
