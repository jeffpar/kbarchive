-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you send messages with attachments on a server running a third-party
antivirus product that uses the Exchange Antivirus application programming
interface (API), you may receive non-delivery reports (NDRs) that contain the
following information:

- Reason code = transfer-failure

- Diagnostic code = invalid-arguments

Also, an event ID 2025 error message from "MSExchangeIS Private" that contains
the following text may be logged in the Application event log:

  The delivery of a message failed due to error BB8 (or 50A). A non-delivery
  report is being sent to the message's originator.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if a user (user1) has an autoforward rule to another user
(user2), and a message with an attachment is sent to both users (user1 and
user2). User2 receives two messages, and the attachment needs to be scanned two
times by the third-party product.


RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Information store

+-------------------------+
| File name | Version     | 
+-------------------------+
| Store.exe | 5.5.2654.61 | 
+-------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, this fix requires Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 4.

version 5.5.
