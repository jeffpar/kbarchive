-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you do the following

1. Use Microsoft Word 2000 to open a document that was created in Hebrew Word 97
  SR-2

2. Save the document in Word 2000 format

3. Reopen the document in Hebrew Word 97

the Hebrew characters all appear the same size.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior results from new formatting features introduced in Word 2000 that
are incompatible with the Hebrew Word 97 format.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, use one of the following methods.

Method 1
--------

In Word 2000, save the document in RTF format instead of Word 2000 format. Move
any macros that are currently in the document to a template.

Method 2
--------

Use a Visual Basic for Applications macro to update the SizeBi property of the
text to be the same as the Size property.

  Sub SizeEqSizeBi()

      Dim i As Integer, iStart As Integer, iSizeBi As Integer
      Dim dCharCount As Double
      Dim rgCurrent As Range
      Dim ch As Characters
      Dim sTab As String

      dCharCount = ActiveDocument.Characters.Count
      iStart = 1
      iSizeBi = ActiveDocument.Characters(iStart).Font.SizeBi
      sTab = Chr(9)
      
      If dCharCount &gt; 1 Then

          For i = 1 To dCharCount
          
              Set rgCurrent = ActiveDocument.Characters(i)
   
              If rgCurrent.Font.SizeBi &lt;&gt; iSizeBi Or i = dCharCount Then
                  'ActiveDocument.Range(iStart - 1, i - 1).Select
                  ActiveDocument.Range(iStart - 1, i - 1).Font.Size = iSizeBi
                  iStart = i
                  iSizeBi = rgCurrent.Font.SizeBi
              End If
     
          Next

      End If

  End Sub

You can replace ActiveDocument with a document object passed in as an argument to
the sub. This works with a batch conversion process.
