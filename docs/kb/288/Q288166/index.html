-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Exchange Server 5.5 message transfer agent (MTA) may stop transferring
messages over some or all connectors that are accessed by the local MTA.

The MTA generates 2187 events:

  An MTA database server error was encountered while attempting to unlock an
  object which is not locked. Called from MTA. Procedure 155. Object at fault:
  08XXXXXX. [DB Server OPERATOR 20 58] (14)

CAUSE
=====

The MTA is experiencing a problem with a gateway delivery thread. The problem is
a result of the deletion of resources that are used internally by the MTA after
a site is deleted.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
