SUMMARY
=======

ArrayCom.exe is a sample file containing a project which includes files that
illustrate the key concepts involved in passing an array by reference from a
Visual FoxPro form to a COM DLL and returning the data that the COM DLL places
into the array. To use the files, extract them into a new directory and follow
the instructions in the enclosed Readme.txt file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  ArrayCom.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/vfox60/sample7/1/WIN98/EN-US/ArrayCom.exe)

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

How to Use the Sample Files
---------------------------

After extracting the files contained in ArrayCom.exe into a new directory, follow
the steps below to use the sample files.

1. Set the default directory to the new directory in which you extract the
  files, and then open the PassArray.pjx project in Visual FoxPro.

2. From the Project menu, choose Build.

3. In the Build Options dialog box, select "Build COM DLL". In addition, select
  "Recompile All Files" and "Display Errors". There should be no errors.

4. Click OK to build the COM DLL. Use the default name PassArray.dll for the DLL
  file.

5. In the Project Manager dialog box, click the Documents tab, select and then
  run the PassArray.scx form. Note that the project excludes this form so that
  it is not built into the COM DLL. The project lists the form for convenience
  only.

6. When you run the form, it should appear with a scrollable list populated by
  the Company field of the sample Customer table from the Testdata.dbc. A
  stripped down version of Testdata.dbc containing only the Customer table is
  included in ArrayCom.exe.

Behind the Scenes
-----------------

The following is an explanation of the form and the COM DLL and how the two work
together.

The form, PassArray.scx, contains a scrollable list and a Quit command button.
The RowSourceType property of the list is "5 [ASCII 150] Array". The RowSource
property is Thisform.listitems, which is a custom property of the form defined
to be an array. This array property is filled in the Load event of the form.

Before examining the code in the Load event of the form, it will be useful to
examine the relevant methods and properties of the COM DLL, Passarray.dll.

There are two custom methods and one custom property in the Passarray class that
the form uses. They are xgetdata(), xtransdata() and xtally.

The first method to be called is xgetdata(). The code from xgetdata() is below:

     SELECT company FROM customer INTO CURSOR junk
     This.xtally=_tally
     SELECT junk
     RETURN FCOUNT()

This method selects the company names from the Customer table. It then sets the
custom property, xtally, of the Passarray class to the number of records
returned by the SELECT statement by setting it equal to the _tally system memory
variable. The _tally system memory variable contains the number of records
processed by the most recently executed table command. Finally, the number of
fields selected is returned by the xgetdata() method by returning the FCOUNT()
function. This is not of much use in this example since only one field is
selected and that is all we are expecting in the form for the list box.

The next method the form calls is xtransdata() to transfer the data selected in
the xgetdata() method to the array passed in from the form by reference. The
code in the xtransdata() method follows:

     LPARAMETERS xx
     EXTERNAL ARRAY xx
     SELECT junk
     COPY TO ARRAY xx

This method just declares that the array passed in as a parameter, xx, is
external. Note that the name of the array that the form passes is temparr (see
sample code below). The name of the array in the form and the array declared in
the LPARAMETERS statement do not need to be the same. The cursor created by the
SELECT statement in xgetdata() is then selected and the COPY TO ARRAY command is
used to copy the records from the cursor into the array, xx.

That is all there is to the COM DLL.

The Load event of the form contains the following code:

     LOCAL lo, lflds
     lo=CREATEOBJECT("passarray.passarray")
     =COMARRAY(lo,11)
     lflds=lo.xgetdata
     DIMENSION temparr(lo.xTally,lflds)
     lo.xtransdata(@temparr)
     =ACOPY(temparr,Thisform.listitems)
     RELEASE lo

The code above illustrates the important concepts of passing an array to the COM
DLL by reference.

The first thing to happen is that the COM DLL is loaded and an object reference
to it is stored in the variable named lo.

The COMARRAY() function is then issued to tell Visual FoxPro how to pass arrays
to the COM object whose reference is stored in the variable lo. The second
argument of COMARRAY() can tell Visual FoxPro to pass arrays by reference or by
value and whether the array is zero or one based. In this case, the value of 11
tells Visual FoxPro to pass the variable as a one- based array by reference.
Please see the documentation for the COMARRAY() function for other values to
use.

Next, you call the xgetdata() method of the COM DLL. The xgetdata() method is
explained in the [ASCII 147]Behind the Scenes[ASCII 148] section.

The number of fields in the cursor created by the SELECT statement is returned to
the lflds variable. Also, remember that the xtally property of the COM DLL is
set to the number of records returned by the SELECT statement.

After the number of records and number of fields is known, an array variable is
dimensioned to the correct size using the xtally property of the COM DLL and the
value returned by the xgetdata() method. There are a couple of things to note
here. First, you dimension an array variable. Eventually, the data returned from
the COM DLL needs to be stored into an array property of the form. You cannot
pass the array property of the form by reference to the COM DLL, so the array
variable is used. Later the ACOPY() function will be used to copy the items from
the array variable to the array property of the form. Secondly, you dimension
the array variable to be the same size as the return data. The size of the array
variable is not adjusted automatically when it is passed to the COM DLL so this
is necessary to do before passing the variable.

Finally, the xtransdata() method of the COM DLL is called with the newly
dimensioned array being passed by reference. The @ symbol is necessary before
the array name to accomplish this even though the COMARRAY() function was used
to tell Visual FoxPro how to pass arrays to the COM DLL. After the data is
transferred into the array in the COM DLL, the ACOPY() function is used to
transfer the data into the array property of the form.
