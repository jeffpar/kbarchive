SUMMARY
=======

The Smsaddin.exe tool, included in the BackOffice Resource Kit, allows you to
register applications so they can be started directly from the Tools menu in the
Systems Management Server Administrator console.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Starting an application from the Systems Management Server Administrator console
requires adding information about the application to the Windows NT registry.

Systems Management Server provides and checks the following key in the registry
for starting an application:

  SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Applications

This key is located under both HKEY_CURRENT_USER and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. Tools
registered under HKEY_CURRENT_USER are available to all Systems Management
Server users; tools registered under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE are available only to
the user who registered the tool.

Based on information you provide during the registration process, the
Smsaddin.exe tool creates a vendor key, one application key for each application
(each application key corresponds to a Tools menu item), and context keys that
determine when the application appears on the Tools menu and specify the
command-line arguments to be passed when starting the application. The data
registered specifies the characteristics of the application, such as a
description, command name, working directory, and so on.

After it is registered, the application becomes available on the Tools menu in
the Systems Management Server Administrator console. Systems Management Server
uses the Registry data to determine how to start the application. Command-line
arguments are resolved dynamically when the application is started.

Smsaddin.exe registers applications in a context-specific manner. Context refers
to the Systems Management Server multiple document interface (MDI) window that
has the focus. Applications registered in a specific context are only available
on the Tools menu when that context is active (that is, when the context
corresponding MDI window has the focus).

You can register an application in more than one context. You can also register
an application in the General context, in which case the application is always
available on the Tools menu. General Context applications always appear in the
upper half of the Tools menu, above the separator line. Context-specific
applications appear below the separator line. If no applications are registered
for the current context, only the General Context applications appear on the
menu.
