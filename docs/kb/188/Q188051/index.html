SUMMARY
=======

Delmif.exe is a tool that is shipped with the BackOffice Resource Kit. The
utility creates MIF that can delete clients both up and down a hierarchy. By
default, DELMIF creates a delete-MIF file that deletes a client from a site
database and all site databases above it.

This file can be used in conjunction with a SQL trigger, so that DELMIF is
invoked automatically after a client is deleted. DELMIF can also be used to
delete clients down a hierarchy by creating command batch files and sending them
to child sites as Package Command Manager service (PCMSVC) jobs.

The problem occurs on the Alpha, MIPS, and x86 platforms.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following components can be used in the command line:

  delmif SMSID [output_directory]

  SMSID - The Systems Management Server ID of the client to delete.

  SMSID_file - A file containing several SMSIDs to be deleted, one per line.

  All characters after the first space on a line are ignored. An easy way to
  create SMSID_file is to execute a query in the Systems Management Server
  Administrator program (with Systems Management Server ID being the first
  column in the query output), highlight the computer names, and paste them
  into a Notepad file.

  output_directory - The directory where the delete-MIF file is written. The
  default is the LastLogonServerPath and ISVMIFCollectionPoint from C:\Sms.ini.
  The output directory can be on any logon server in Logon.srv\Isvmif.box, or
  on the site server in Site.srv\Isvmif.box. (The Site.srv directory gives a
  slightly faster response). Specifying an output directory is recommended.

Example
-------

The following command creates a delete-MIF file for the client with the SMS ID
ABC00012:

     delmif  ABC00012

The following command creates a delete-MIF file for the client with the Systems
Management Server ID ABC00345, and writes the delete-MIF file to D:\Test:

     delmif  ABC00345  d:\test

The following command creates a delete-MIF file for each client whose Systems
Management Server ID is listed in Del.dat:

     delmif  @del.dat

Use the following syntax for a SQL trigger that will automate the execution of
Delmif.exe when a computer's inventory is deleted from the Systems Management
Server database. Because inventory MIFs flow up the Systems Management Server
hierarchy, this will result in the same client inventory being deleted from all
primary sites to the top of the Systems Management Server hierarchy.

DELMIF trigger
--------------

     create trigger delmachine
     on Machines
     FOR DELETE
     AS
     DECLARE @smsid varchar(255)
     DECLARE tIDs CURSOR FOR
     select  SMSID0
     from    MachineDataHistoryTable m (index = dwMachineID_idx),
     Identification_SPEC i, deleted d
     where   i.datakey = m.SpecificKey and
             GroupKey = 1 and
             m.ArchitectureKey = 5  and
             m.dwMachineID = d.dwMachineID
     open tIDs
     FETCH NEXT
     FROM tIDs
     INTO @smsid
     WHILE (@@fetch_status &lt;&gt; -1)
     BEGIN
        exec master..xp_delmif @smsid, "C:\SMS\site.srv\isvmif.box\"
        FETCH NEXT
        FROM tIDs
        INTO @smsid
     end
     close tIDs
     deallocate tIDs

NOTE: It may be necessary to modify the output path the MIF is written to. For
more information on this topic, refer to the Systems Management Server Resource
Guide included in the BackOffice Resource Kit.
