-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A user sends a message over an X.400 Connector configured in 1984 mode and
requests a delivery receipt. The message is delivered to the remote user, the
report is returned, but it is discarded by the sending user's store, and the
sending user does not receive the report. The following event is logged by the
store:

  Computer: ComputerName
  Event-ID: 2026
  Source  : MSExchangeIS Private
  Type    : Information
  Category: Transport General

  The delivery of a report failed due to error 00000BB8. The report has
  been deleted.

CAUSE
=====

The delivery report has an invalid X.400 format. This happens when the message
transfer agent (MTA) that receives the message over the 1984 link (the
"Connector Server") routes it to another MTA in the site for delivery, and the
recipient has an Alternative Recipient set. The delivering MTA delivers the
message correctly and creates the delivery report. However, the Actual Recipient
attribute in the report contains only the Directory Name, and not the O/R
Address of the recipient. When the report reaches the connector server, it must
be downgraded to 1984 format for transfer over the connector. The Directory Name
is removed, and the Actual Recipient attribute consists of only an empty
Standard Attributes set, an invalid structure.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack
