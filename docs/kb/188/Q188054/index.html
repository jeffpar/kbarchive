The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Smgenie.exe, available in the Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit, generates
events that simulate actual system and application events. The purpose of
SMGENIE is to test the SNMP Event to Trap Translator, which converts specified
events to SNMP traps when the events are written to the Windows NT Event log.

After SMGENIE (which runs on computers with either Alpha or Intel-based
processors) is started, the SMGENIE window appears on your screen.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After Systems Management Server is installed and the SNMP components are set up,
you can configure the SNMP Event to Trap Translator with the events to
translate. For detailed information about the configuration process, see the SMS
1.2 Administrator's Guide. Then, use SMGENIE to generate events to the Windows
NT Event log. Events that have been set in the SNMP Event to Trap Translator
will be translated into traps and sent to the site server.

To Generate Events with SMGENIE
-------------------------------

1. Select an event log from the Event Logs box.

2. Select an event source from the Event Sources box.

  The events for the selected event source are displayed in the list at the top
  of the window. The number of events available in the event source are
  displayed in the Event Count box. You can use the Auto search box to locate
  an event source among all the Event logs. In the Auto search box, type the
  name of a source.

3. Select events by scrolling through the list and clicking on them.

  You can use SHIFT + CLICK and CTRL + CLICK combinations to select ranges and
  multiple events. The number of selected events is shown in the lower-right
  status bar of the window.

4. You can change the default substring value. The default is TEST-STRING.

  The substring is placed into each event wherever there is a percent sign (%)
  followed by a number. (In actual Windows NT event generation, subsequent
  numbers denote different strings. In SMGENIE, the substring is used
  regardless of the number following the percent sign.)

5. Generate events in either of the following two ways:

   - Click Generate Events.

   - In the Auto generate box, specify integers for Multiples and Interval In
     Seconds, then select Auto Generate. Multiples specifies how many events to
     generate for each selected event, and Interval In Seconds specifies the
     time to elapse between each event, repeating until Auto Generate is no
     longer selected.

     For example, if Winlogon is the event source, events 1001 and 1002 are
     selected, and the default settings are used, selecting Auto Generate
     generates one of each event every five seconds. Two events are logged in
     the Windows NT event log every five seconds -- one for event 1001 and one
     for event 1002.

     The number of events generated is shown in the lower-left status bar.
