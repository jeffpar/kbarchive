-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you go to the Tools menu in the Exchange client, the Inbox Assistant and
Out of Office Assistant menu items are missing.

CAUSE
=====

The Inbox Assistant and Out Of Office Assistant are removed from the Tools menu
after uninstalling Netscape Navigator, version 2.01. This is caused by a
registry key that is removed during the uninstall of Netscape. The missing
registry key is:

 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Exchange\Client\Extensions

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following procedures:

Before Uninstalling Netscape
----------------------------

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

1. Run the Registry Editor and export the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Exchange\Client\Extensions

2. Uninstall Netscape.

3. Import the registry key that was exported in step 1.

After Uninstalling Netscape
---------------------------

NOTE: This procedure can only be used on computers where the files are installed
in the same locations.

1. Find a computer that is not experiencing this problem.

2. Run the Registry Editor and export the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Exchange\Client\Extensions

3. Import the registry key on the problem computer.

If it is not possible to export and import the registry key, you must remove and
re-install the Exchange client.
