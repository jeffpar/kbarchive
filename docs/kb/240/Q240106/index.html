-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using TCP/IP over a Remote Access Services (RAS) connection, a Host
Announcement packet from the RAS client causes the RAS server to reset the
automatic disconnection timer.

On a Windows NT-based computer, the Announce parameter defaults to 720 seconds
(or 12 minutes). On a Windows NT-based RAS server, the RAS automatic disconnect
parameter defaults to 20 minutes. If the RAS client is also a Windows NT-based
computer, the RAS automatic disconnect timer is reset every 12 minutes, and
therefore, the RAS client never times out.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT 4.0 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English-language version of this fix should have the following file
attributes or later:
