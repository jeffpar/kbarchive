SUMMARY
=======

The metabase is a structure for storing Internet Information Server (IIS)
configuration settings. It performs some of the same functions as the Windows
system registry but is specific to Internet Information Server version 4.0. New
keys and values have been added for finer and more flexible control of IIS.

When a system is upgraded from IIS 3.0 or earlier to IIS 4.0, the configuration
parameters that were previously set in the registry are migrated to the
metabase. When IIS starts, it loads the metabase into memory, where it is
available until IIS shuts down. The metabase is stored in a special format file
by default named Metabase.bin in the Inetsrv folder in which IIS is normally
installed.

Like the registry, the metabase is organized in a hierarchical structure that
mirrors the structure of your IIS installation. It is made up of nodes, keys,
and subkeys. The main organization is by node, with each node in the metabase
structure representing a site or directory. Beneath the nodes are keys that may
contain one or more IIS configuration values called metabase properties. The
metabase keys correspond to individual configuration elements of IIS; each key
contains properties that affect the configuration of its associated directory or
site.

The structure of the metabase facilitates different settings of a property for
different nodes. For example, the MaxBandwidth property setting can be different
for each virtual site. However, metabase properties are inherited. This means
that those parameters that are configured at higher levels, such as the Web site
level, will affect the lower levels. But if you set a specific property for an
individual site, virtual site, or virtual directory, changes made at a higher
level will not automatically override the lower-level individual setting. Note
that when the metabase is searched for configuration information, it is
enumerated from the bottom, or subkey, to top, or node.

Many of the metabase parameters can be configured from the Internet Service
Manager snap-in for the Microsoft Management Console (MMC). Additional tools are
also available for further tuning of the metabase.

Caution:

Configuring properties in the metabase incorrectly can cause problems, including
the failure of a Web site or FTP site. If you make mistakes, your Web site or
FTP site's configuration could be damaged. You should edit metabase properties
only for settings that you cannot adjust in the user interface. Be very careful
whenever you edit the metabase directly.

There are two main ways to edit the metabase:

- IIS Administration Script Utility (Adsutil): Adsutil.vbs is a Visual Basic
  Script utility that uses Active Directory Service Interfaces (ADSI) to
  manipulate the configuration of IIS. Run this script using CScript, which is
  installed with the Windows Scripting Host as part of the Windows NT Option
  Pack. Cscript.exe is installed to %system root%/System32. Adsutil.vbs is
  installed to %system root$/System32/Inetsrv/Adminsamples.

- Mdutil.exe: This utility is available on the Option Pack CD-ROM. It can be
  utilized from: \Ntoppak\En\X86\Winnt.srv\Mdutil.exe.
