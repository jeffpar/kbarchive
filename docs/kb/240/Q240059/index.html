SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure Routing Information Protocol (RIP) with multiple adapters and
with all the default settings (including the Split Horizon with Poison Reverse
advanced settings), the RIP updates that are sent out have the correct metrics
for both of the RIP routes. However, RIP also advertises the routes that it
learns on the same subnet with a metric of 16 (poison reverse). On the Routing
and Remote Access Services (RRAS) computer that receives the RIP updates (with
the poison reverse update), the route should not be processed because RIP
already has a better route for that subnet (subnet A). It should also
distinguish the fact that this update is from a computer that is not the
destination router for that route to subnet A. However, RRAS processes that
route and therefore discards out a good route in favor of an unreachable route
(metric = 16). Any computer on its own remote subnet cannot reach this subnet
(subnet A), which now has a metric of 16.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT Server or Workstation 4.0
------------------------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or the
individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
pack, please go to:

Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
----------------------------------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition.

This problem was first corrected in Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6 and
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Split Horizon with Poison Reverse setting improves RIP convergence over a
simple split horizon by advertising all network IDs, but those network IDs
learned in a given direction are advertised with a metric of 16, indicating that
the network is unavailable. The Poison Reverse setting has no benefit beyond the
split horizon setting in a single-path internetwork. However, in a multiple-path
internetwork, the Split Horizon with Poison Reverse setting greatly reduces
counts to infinity and routing loops.

This behavior is described in Request for Comments (RFC) 1058, "Routing
Information Protocol."
