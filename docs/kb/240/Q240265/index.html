SUMMARY
=======

This article contains comments, corrections, and information about known errors
relating to the Microsoft Press book Programming Microsoft Office 2000 Web
Components, ISBN 0-7356-0794-x.

The following topics are covered:

- CD-ROM: Copy Readme.txt File To Hard Drive

- Chapter 8: Solution For This Chapter Does Not Work

- Chapter 10 Files Updated To Accommodate Change In Microsoft Investor

- Chapter 12 Files Missing From CD-ROM

MORE INFORMATION
================

CD-ROM: Copy Readme.txt File To Hard Drive
------------------------------------------

The sample code applications for this book are complex, and the instructions for
using the code vary from chapter to chapter. There are specific notes in the
Readme.txt file that will assist you in running the sample code from your hard
drive. It is recommended that you copy the Readme.txt file to your hard drive so
that you can easily refer to it when needed.


Chapter 8: Solution For This Chapter Does Not Work
--------------------------------------------------

Symptoms:

When you first open the Chapter 8 solution on the CD, it appears to work
correctly. You can create and edit a timesheet. When you submit a timesheet,
everything seems to be working fine. However, when you try to retrieve the
submitted timesheet, the program fails. The timesheet was not actually saved.
The spreadsheet area of the web page may appear white instead of with its usual
formatting. If you quit and reopen the page, the spreadsheet area once again
appears white.

Resolution:

Replace the ..\Chap08\Timesheet.asp file with this revised version.

Chapter 10 Files Updated To Accommodate Change In Microsoft Investor
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The files in chapter 10 may not work correctly due to a change in the Microsoft
Investor web site. The self-extracting archive file mentioned above includes a
fix for this problem.

Chapter 12 Files Missing From CD-ROM
------------------------------------

The Chapter 12 files were missing from the CD-ROM included with the first
printing of "Programming Microsoft Office 2000 Web Components." The
self-extracting archive file mentioned above includes those missing files.

Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
already contain most or all of the above corrections.
