IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

The Directory service stops responding (hangs) and logs the following error
message in the event log:

  Event ID: 1186
  Source: MSExchangeDS
  Type: Error
  Category: Replication
  Description: The internal directory replication agent (DRA) Dispatcher thread
  is waiting in a remote procedure call (RPC) to directory XXXX. The directory
  has attempted to cancel the call and recover the thread, with status 0x0. If
  this condition persists, stop and restart that Microsoft Exchange Server
  computer.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if the directory replication agent (DRA) waits for more
than 35 minutes for directory replication to complete within a site. This
default timeout is normally sufficient and is exceeded only if a very large
distribution list is being replicated or if there is limited usable bandwidth
between the servers within the Exchange Server site.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, restart the server that is experiencing the error,
as well as the server that is specified in the text of the event. This works
only if you find and resolve the underlying cause of the behavior (for example,
saturated network links). The client may also need to look into breaking up
large distribution lists.

If the problem persists after you restart both servers, you can change the
behavior of the DRA by modifying the following registry values:

- Directory Replication Timeout

- Max Threads

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Directory Replication Timeout
-----------------------------

You can change the default directory replication timeout value by adding the
following key into the registry:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeDs\Parameters

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

  Value Name: Replicator async thread check (minutes)
  Data Type: REG_DWORD
  Value: 35 (Dec,default)

4. Quit Registry Editor.

NOTE: Increase this value in increments of 30 until you no longer receive the
error message.

Max Threads
-----------

To increase the number of threads available for directory replication, adjust the
following parameter:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the Max Threads value under the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\
  MSExchangeDS\Parameters\Max Threads (EXDS+NSP+DRA)

3. Click the Max Threads value.

4. On the Edit menu, click DWORD.

5. In the Data field, type "200" (without the quotation marks) (Dec), and then
  click OK.

6. Quit Registry Editor.

This action increases the number of threads available from the default of 50 to
200. You may need to adjust this value for best results.
