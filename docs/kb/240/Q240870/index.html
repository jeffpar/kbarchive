-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP5 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to make a Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) connection
from a Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5 (SP5) client to a Windows NT 4.0 SP5 PPTP
server running Remote Access Services (RAS) or Routing and Remote Access
Services (RRAS), the initial authentication attempt may not succeed and may
display an "Error 5: Access Denied" error message. This problem can also occur
if RRAS is configured to forward Microsoft Challenge-Handshake Authentication
Protocol (MS-CHAP) version 2 authentication requests to a Remote Authentication
Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) server.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by a problem in Rasrad.dll, in which the challenge from
the RRAS server to the client is incorrectly formatted. This problem results in
the client rejecting the challenge and disconnecting the session.

==========

  Q222060 Err Msg: 'Error 5: Access Denied' When Using PPTP with RAS

To enable MS-CHAP with RADIUS authentication, you must add the following registry
value:

  Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Rasman\PPP\CHAP

  Value Name: OfferMSCHAP
  Type: DWORD
  Data Value: 0x00000001 - Once this is enabled, every incoming Point-to-Point
  Protocol (PPP) connection is offered MS-CHAP, and MS-CHAP is used to
  authenticate each PPP user against the RADIUS server that your RAS server is
  using.
