SYMPTOMS
========

If your computer uses the "NoDrives" policy to hide local drives in Windows NT
Explorer, but your desktop includes links to folders on hidden local drives to
provide limited access to local data, you cannot gain access to these local
folders by using their desktop links after upgrading to Windows NT 4.0 Service
Pack 5 (SP5).

When you attempt to open such a folder from the desktop, you receive the
following error message:

  This operation has been canceled due to restrictions in effect on this
  computer. Please contact your system administrator.
