SYMPTOMS
========

When you log on to a computer running Terminal Server Edition, you may receive
the following error message:

  An application error has occurred and an application error log is being
  generated.
  Userinit.exe
  Exception: access violation (0xc0000005), Address: 0x77f901b3

NOTE: The address value may be different, depending on your computer
configuration.

The Terminal Server client is disconnected after you click OK or Cancel.

CAUSE

This behavior occurs because an invalid value exists in the registry.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this issue, delete the invalid registry value:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Terminal
  Server\Install\IniFile Times

3. Locate the invalid value (this is usually a value with no name).

4. Click the invalid value.

5. On the Edit menu, click Delete, and then click Yes.

6. Quit Registry Editor.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Windows NT 4.0 Server, Terminal Server Edition, Service Pack 5.
