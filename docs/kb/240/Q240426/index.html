SYMPTOMS
========

On a Systems Management Server (SMS) version 2.0 site server or component
server, you may not be able to gather data from the SMS-related performance
counters in the Windows NT Performance Monitor tool, or with third-party
performance-monitoring software.

In Performance Monitor, the symptoms of this problem can include the complete
absence of SMS performance counters or slow performance when adding.

In third-party programs, the symptoms can include an error message when
initializing Smsperf.dll or the inability to gather some or all performance data
from the SMS site or component server.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.
