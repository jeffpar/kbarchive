-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP2 
- Microsoft Outlook 97, versions 8.03, 8.04 
- Microsoft Outlook 98 
- Microsoft Outlook 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the updated AutoAccept Event script, when you access the resource
calendar (on the File menu, click Open, and then click Other User's Folder) with
Reviewer permission, the following error message is displayed:

  Can't open this item. Unable to open the free/busy information.

Also, dates on which meetings are scheduled may not be bold, and the AutoAccept
script may not decline conflicting meetings.

CAUSE
=====

You do not have full control permissions to update the locally cached copy of
free and busy information for the resource. The following process occurs:

1. The free and busy information is updated on the server.

2. The locally cached copy of the free and busy information is deleted.

3. The server attempts to provide a complete copy of the free and busy
  information to the client.

  NOTE: If the client that you currently use to log on to the server does not
  have full control permissions, the locally cached copy is not updated.

4. You experience the problems described in the "Symptoms" section of this
  article.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can use one of the following methods to work around this problem:

Workaround 1:

1. Set up one Windows NT account that has full permissions for all of the
  resource mailboxes that use the AutoAccept script.

2. Log on to each resource mailbox once, and set each resource mailbox to update
  the free and busy information on the server every minute:

  a. On the Tools menu, click Options.

  b. Click Calendar Options, and then click Free/Busy Options.

  c. In the "Update free/busy information on the server every" box, type "1"
     (without the quotation marks).

  Then log off from the resource mailbox.

3. At a client computer, log on using the Windows NT account that you created
  that has full permissions for all of the resource mailboxes.

4. Start Outlook and log on to one of the resource mailboxes. On the File menu,
  click Open, and then click Other User's Folder to open every other resource
  mailbox, and then leave them open.

Workaround 2:

Log on to the server using the resource mailbox, and then open Outlook using the
/CleanFreeBusy switch.

Workaround 3:

This workaround requires a pure Outlook 2000 environment. Deploy Outlook 2000,
and then follow the instructions in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
article:
