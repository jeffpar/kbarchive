-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Microsoft TreeView control has been added to a Visual Basic form, and
the user places the mouse cursor over a node where the text is longer than the
control's width, a tooltip should appear over that text. If the form is being
displayed modally, however, the tooltip will "flash" on and off repeatedly. This
behavior occurs only in the compiled version of the application and not in the
Visual Basic design environment (IDE.) This problem occurs with the TreeView
control from both the Comctl32.ocx and Mscomctl.ocx on all Windows platforms.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is a result of the TreeView's owned tooltip window becoming
disabled when the TreeView's top level client window is shown modally.

RESOLUTION
==========

The tooltip window must be re-enabled before shown, and after the TreeView's top
level owner window is fully loaded.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTES

- Mscomctl.ocx is statically linked to version 5.x of Comctl32.dll, and is not
  affected by the version of Comctl32.dll installed on the target system.

- The workaround provided below is insufficient when running under Windows NT
  4.0 and comctl32.dll version 4.x or lower is installed. In this case
  implement the workaround described in the Microsoft Knowledge Base article
  Q241097 referred to in the REFERENCES section below.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Visual Basic Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. On the Project menu, select Components. Check either Microsoft Windows Common
  Controls 5.0 or Microsoft Windows Common Controls 6.0 and click OK.

3. Add two CommandButtons and a Label to Form1.

4. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Form1:

  Option Explicit

  Private Sub Form_Load()
     On Error Resume Next
    
    ' Since the problem only occurs in the IDE, only disable the
    ' TreeView's Node tooltip window in the VB IDE.
    ' Since the Statement Debug.Print is removed by compiling, you can use
    ' it to throw an error to detect the IDE.
     Debug.Print 1 / 0
     If Err Then
        Command1.Enabled = False
        Command2.Enabled = False
        Me.Caption = "Application MUST be compiled"
     End If
     On Error GoTo 0
     Command1.Caption = "Show Form2 modally"
     Command2.Caption = "Show Form2 non-modally"
     Label1.Caption = "If Form2 is shown modally and run from a compiled " _
   &amp; "executable, its TreeView Node tooltip window will repeatedly appear" _
   &amp; " and disappear, unless you enable it (remove its WS_DISABLED)."

  End Sub

  Private Sub Command1_Click()
     If (Form2.Visible = False) Then
        Form2.Command1.Enabled = True
        Form2.Show vbModal
     End If
  End Sub

  Private Sub Command2_Click()
     Form2.Command1.Enabled = False
     Form2.Show
  End Sub

5. On the Project menu, click Add Form to add a second form to the project.

6. Add the TreeView control and a CommandButton to Form2. Resize the TreeView
  Control so that 35 characters of Node Text are partially obscured.

7. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Form2:

  Option Explicit

  Private Declare Function SendMessage Lib "user32" Alias "SendMessageA" _
                            (ByVal hWnd As Long, ByVal wMsg As Long, _
                             ByVal wParam As Long, lParam As Any) As Long

  ' treeview messages
  Private Const TV_FIRST = &amp;H1100
  Private Const TVM_GETTOOLTIPS = (TV_FIRST + 25)

  Private Const GWL_STYLE = (-16)
  Private Const WS_DISABLED = &amp;H8000000

  Private Declare Function GetWindowLong Lib "user32" Alias _
   "GetWindowLongA" (ByVal hWnd As Long, ByVal nIndex As Long) As Long

  Private Declare Function EnableWindow Lib "user32" _
   (ByVal hWnd As Long, bEnable As Long) As Long

  Private Sub Form_Load()
     Dim i As Integer

     ' Fill up the treeview...
     For i = 1 To 10
        Call TreeView1.Nodes.Add(Text:="item" &amp; i &amp; String$(30, "x"))
     Next
     Command1.Caption = "Enable TreeView Tooltips"
  End Sub

  Private Sub Command1_Click()
     Dim hwndTT As Long
     Dim dwStyle As Long
    
    ' Get the handle of the TreeView's tooltip window
     hwndTT = SendMessage(TreeView1.hWnd, TVM_GETTOOLTIPS, 0, 0)
     If hwndTT Then ' If the tooltip window is disabled, enable it.
        If (GetWindowLong(hwndTT, GWL_STYLE) And WS_DISABLED) Then
           Call EnableWindow(hwndTT, 1)
        End If
     End If

    ' All done...
    Command1.Enabled = False
  End Sub

8. From the File menu, choose Make Project1.exe.

9. Run the compiled executable and display Form2 both non-modally and modally,
  placing the cursor over TreeView Node text.

  NOTE: When displayed modally the tooltip window flashes unless the TreeView
  Node tooltip window is enabled by clicking the CommandButton.
