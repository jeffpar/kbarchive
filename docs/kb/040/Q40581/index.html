Question:

I have written a large program that needs to be overlaid to run in
DOS. Is there a way I can compile it for OS/2, then BIND it to run in
DOS with overlays so that I only have a single executable for both
OS/2 and DOS?

Response:

You cannot do this; to BIND a program to run in DOS, you need a
protected-mode executable. However, protected-mode executables do not
understand overlays. As a result, there is no way to BIND a program
that needs overlays in DOS. You have to have two different
executables.

Note: The two executables could be combined into one large executable
by creating the real-mode executable and naming it in the STUB
statement in the .DEF file when linking the OS/2 application. There is
no real advantage to this; however, the new .EXE file will be a little
larger than the two separate files. The STUB statement is documented
by the C 5.10 utilities update in the LINK section.
