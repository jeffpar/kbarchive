There is a maximum number of directories you can set in both the
compile line and the INCLUDE environment variable. The combined
maximum is 15. Exceeding the maximum can cause the error U1013 or
U1077 in a MAKE file.

No error message is given if the compile line is typed in directly
from the DOS prompt. The program just fails to compile. This maximum
applies to both DOS and OS/2.

Note: If you have 14 directories in your include environment variable
and added several others at the command line (with one /I, as opposed
to using a /I for every directory), you could break this boundary.
However, you should normally avoid using more than 15 directories.
