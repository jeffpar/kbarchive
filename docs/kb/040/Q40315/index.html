The following information about sample programs is taken from the
SAMPLES.DOC file included with the Microsoft QuickC Compiler Version
2.00.

In addition to the reference and "C For Yourself" manual examples in
the QC Advisor, the following sample programs are provided with
QuickC:

   Files              Description

   GRDEMO.MAK         GRDEMO illustrates general graphics techniques
   GRDEMO.C           including drawing, animation, palette
   MENU.C             switching, window adjustment, menus, and
   MENU.H             turtle graphics. The MENU and TURTLE modules
   TURTLE.C           are independent modules that could be used
   TURTLE.H           in your own programs.

   LIFE.MAK           LIFE illustrates general C and inline assembler
   LIFE.C             techniques. In particular, it shows how to write
   TOOLS.C            entire screens to the screen buffer. The TOOLS
   TOOLS.H            module contains independent functions and
                      macros that could be used in your own programs.

   CHRTDEMO.MAK       CHRTDEMO illustrates presentation graphics
   CHRTDEMO.C         techniques. You can use this program as a tool
   CHRTSUPT.C         for testing different modes and options before
   CHRTDEMO.H         building them into your own programs.

   CRLF.C             CRLF is a tool for converting certain files that
                      can not be loaded into the QC environment. It
                      removes unwanted control characters and ensures
                      that each line is terminated by a carriage-return/
                      line-feed pair. CRLF.EXE is also provided on the
                      utilities disk.
