SUMMARY
=======

SMARTDrive, the MS-DOS disk caching driver, supports the use of extended memory
and expanded memory, but not conventional memory. SMARTDRV.SYS was designed as a
disk caching program for environments with memory that MS-DOS does not use
heavily: extended and expanded memory. The maximum 640K of conventional memory
is so valuable that most people don't waste it with disk caching.

Most people would rather use this precious conventional memory for running
programs, and not for SMARTDrive to speed up their systems. However, if you do
want to use SMARTDrive to speed up your system, there are two upgrade paths
available, which are as follows:

- Obtain an expanded memory board (or software to emulate an expanded memory
  board, such as the MS-DOS version 4.0 driver EMM386.SYS).

-or-

- Obtain an extended memory board.

SMARTDrive can be used in the extended or expanded memory areas. MS-DOS original
equipment manufacturers (OEMs) may choose to modify SMARTDrive to support
conventional memory if they decide that the memory choices SMARTDrive was
designed with are not adequate.
