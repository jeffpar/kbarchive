SUMMARY
=======

If you are using Systems Management Server (SMS) and you try to connect to the
site server, you may receive a "Connection Failed" message, or the nodes may not
be displayed after you are connected. This article describes how to troubleshoot
a new or an existing SMS Administrator console to determine why it cannot
connect to the site server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following procedure describes how to grant additional users access to the
SMS Administrator console:

1. Create a global group for the domain that contains users who require specific
  access to the SMS Administrator console.

2. Add this global group (or the explicit domain user account) to the local SMS
  Admins group.

3. Configure the SMS permissions for the global group that you created.

  NOTE: To complete this step you must be an administrator with full permissions
  on the site.

  The permissions that you grant depend on the functionality that you want the
  members of this global group to perform. To grant permissions, right-click
  the Security rights node in the SMS Administrator console, point to All
  tasks, and then click Manage SMS Users to start the Security Wizard.

4. Use the wizard to add, remove, or modify the security settings of users and
  groups.

NOTE: For SMS Service Pack 3 (SP3) hierarchies in Microsoft Windows 2000 domains,
you may have to obtain the hotfix that is described in the following Microsoft
Knowledge Base article:

Administrator console, click the article number below to view the article in the

Troubleshooting SMS Administrator Console Connectivity
------------------------------------------------------

To troubleshoot SMS Administrator console connectivity, consider the following
issues:

- Is the user a member of a global group that is a member in the SMS Admins
  group, or is the user explicitly defined in the SMS Admins Group?

  The SMS Admins group is created during the SMS site installation. If your site
  was installed on a member server, the SMS Admins group is a local group in
  the local Security Accounts Manager (SAM). If your site server is a domain
  controller, the SMS Admins group is a local group in the domain. The user
  must be part of the SMS Admins group because it is granted the necessary
  permissions to the SMS and SMS_site code namespace in the Windows Management
  Instrumentation (WMI) repository when the SMS site is built.

- Has this server had a previous installation of SMS?

  If so, there may be multiple site codes in the SMS_ProviderLocation class that
  is located in the site server's SMS namespace. Delete any site code that no
  longer exists on the site server. You can use the WBEMtest tool (as described
  in the following procedure) to view the SMS_ProverLocation class.

For additional information about WBEMtest, click the article number below to view
the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q239899 Administrator Console Cannot Connect After Reinstallation

- On the site server, view the properties that are defined in Dcomcnfg.exe
  utility.

  To do so, click the Default properties tab, and then confirm the following
  settings:

   - The "Enable Distributed COM on this computer" check box is selected.

   - The Default Authentication level is set Connect.

   - The Default Impersonation level is set to Identify.

- If you are testing a remote SMS Administrator console, make sure that the
  latest SMS service pack has been applied to this console.

  Run Setup from the service pack source to determine if the SMS Administrator
  console is the only component that must to be upgraded.

After you consider these issues, complete the troubleshooting procedures that are
described in the following sections.

Troubleshooting SMS Namespace Connectivity:

Make sure that the user can connect to the SMS namespace and the SMS_'sitecode'
namespaces:

1. Click Start, click Run, and then type "wbemtest" (without the quotation
  marks).

2. Click Connect, type "\\siteserver\root\sms" (without the quotation marks),
  and then click Login.

3. Click Enum Classes, click Recursive, and then click OK.

4. In the Query Result list, double-click SMS_ProviderLocation.

5. Click Instances, and then double-click the line that contains the target site
  code (for example, SMS_ProviderLocation.SiteCode="&lt;xxx&gt;").

6. In the Properties section, locate the NamespacePath line (you may have to
  double-click this line to see the whole line).

7. Copy this value to the clipboard (for example, copy the following value:
  \\&lt;server_name&gt;\root\sms\site_&lt;xxx&gt;).

If you successfully complete this procedure, you can connect to the site server
and enumerate the SMS namespace.

Troubleshooting Server Connectivity:

Next, determine if you can connect to the server that the provider is located on.
The server is defined in the NamespacePath value that you determined in the
"Troubleshooting SMS Namespace Connectivity" section. Typically, this server is
the same server.

1. Close any WBEMtest windows that may be open (you must see only the main
  window).

2. Click Connect, paste the path that you copied in step 7 of the procedure
  described earlier, and then click Login.

3. Click Enum Classes, click Recursive, and then click OK

4. In the Query Result list, double-click SMS_Site.

If you receive an "access denied" error message when you perform this procedure,
the account that is used does not have the appropriate permissions to the
namespace of the provider. To modify or verify the permissions, follow these
steps.

NOTE: The following procedure is for Microsoft WMI 1.5, which is included in
Microsoft Windows 2000.

1. On the server on which you enumerated the SMS site, click Start, click Run,
  type "wmimgmt.msc" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.

2. Right-click WMI Control, and then click Properties.

3. On the Security tab, expand Root, and then click SMS.

4. Click Security in the right pane to see the permissions.

5. Click Advanced, click SMS Admins, and then click View-edit.

  For the SMS namespace, the SMS Admins group must have the following
  permissions:

   - Enable account

   - Remote enable

6. Repeat steps 1 to 5 to check the SMS Admins group for the SMS_&lt;xxx&gt;
  namespace (where &lt;xxx&gt; is the site code). The SMS Admins group must
  have the following permissions:

   - Execute Methods

   - Provider Write

   - Enable Account

   - Remote Enable

Additional Connectivity Tests
-----------------------------

Start the WMI Control on the site server (not the provider server if this server
is different), click the Logging tab, and then set the logging level to Verbose
to increase the logging to the
&lt;Windows_folder&gt;\System32\Wbem\Logs\Wbemcore.log file.

Analyze this log on the site server. You see all of the WMI traffic that is
generated. Look for the query for SMS_Providerlocation that occurred when an SMS
Administrator console tried to connect. If this query is present, you can
confirm that there is communication between the console and the site server.
Test connectivity from the site server back to the requesting SMS Administrator
console.

If WBEMtest connectivity testing determines that the remote procedure call (RPC)
server is unavailable, see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q229091 SMS: Remote Administrator Gets a 'Connection Failed' Error When
  Connecting to Site Server

The error message that is described in this article may also occur if name
resolution is not completed correctly. To determine if you are experiencing a
name resolution issue, use the WBEMtest tool and try to connect to the site
server by using the IP address (for example, \\111.222.333.444\root\default). If
you can connect when you use the IP address, but you cannot connect when you use
the netBIOS name of the site server, you are experiencing a name resolution
issue. To resolve this issue, confirm either the WINS or the DNS
configurations.

NOTE: If you can connect to the database but if the nodes are not enumerated (for
example, the collections node, the packages node, and other nodes), check the
SMS permissions that are granted to the global group (or a specific user) in the
Security node of the SMS Administrator console.
