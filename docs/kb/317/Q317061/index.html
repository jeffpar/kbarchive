-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

If you distribute a package to a Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 site in
which the site server and Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server are installed on the
same computer, the package may not arrive at the distribution points for that
site.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because SMS Distribution Manager (SMS_DISTRIBUTION_MANAGER)
recognizes the Installable File System (IFS) drive of Exchange 2000 Server as a
fixed drive instead of an IFS drive. Therefore, Distribution Manager may try to
decompress the SMS package to the virtual drive, to which it does not have Write
access. Distribution Manager selects the NTFS drive that has the most free disk
space as the decompression drive.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English-language version of this fix for SMS 2.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) should
have the following file attributes or later:

  Date         Time   Version         Size     File name     Platform
  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  01-Mar-2001  04:20  2.00.1493.3240  810,768  Baseutil.dll  Alpha
  01-Mar-2001  04:20  2.00.1493.3240  359,184  Distmgr.dll   Alpha
  01-Mar-2001  04:20  2.00.1493.3240  526,272  Baseutil.dll  i386
  01-Mar-2001  04:20  2.00.1493.3240  230,800  Distmgr.dll   i386

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that
contains the above files may also contain additional files.



To install the hotfix, use the appropriate method.

Use the Hotfix Installer
------------------------

NOTE: This method is only for Intel-based computers.

1. Create a folder in a location that is accessible to your SMS site servers.

2. Copy the update file (Q317061.exe) and platform folders to the new folder.
  The folder structure must be such that the update file is located one folder
  "above" the platform folders.

3. From each of the primary and secondary SMS site servers in your environment,
  log on to your site server by using an account with administrative
  permissions.

4. Quit the SMS Administrator console, if it is running.

5. Run Q317061.exe, and then follow the directions in the wizard.

Install the Hotfix Manually
---------------------------

1. Create a folder in a location that is accessible to your SMS site servers.

2. Copy the platform folders that contain the hotfix files to the new folder.

3. From each of the primary and secondary SMS site servers in your environment,
  log on to your site server by using an account with administrative
  permissions.

4. Quit the SMS Administrator console, if it is running.

5. Stop all SMS services, and stop the Windows Management or Windows Management
  Instrumentation service.

6. Replace the Baseutil.dll file in the
  &lt;Sms_root_folder&gt;\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the version from the
  hotfix.

7. Replace the Distmgr.dll file in the
  &lt;Sms_root_folder&gt;\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the version from the
  hotfix.

8. Restart all of the SMS services, and restart the Windows Management or
  Windows Management Instrumentation service.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

You can make the following registry change to hide the IFS drive from Windows
Explorer, and to prevent SMS from using the IFS drive to decompress packages:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate and then click the following registry value:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EXIFS\Parameters\DriveLetter

3. Change the data value to be blank (remove the "M" and do not leave a space).

4. Restart the server.

NOTE: If you hide the Exchange 2000 Server IFS drive by modifying the registry
value, Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) may not function properly.

STATUS
======
