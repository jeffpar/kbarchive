RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems

additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific

To Install the Hotfix

To install the hotfix, use the appropriate method on the SMS site server and on
each SMS Administrator console.

  console by using an account with administrator permissions.

3. Make sure that the SMS Administrator console is not running.

4. Run Q317795.exe and follow the instructions in the wizard. You can run
  Q317795.exe in Quiet mode by using the /s switch.

Manually Installing the Hotfix:

To manually install the hotfix on a site server or on a computer that runs the
SMS Administrator console:

1. On the site server, make sure that the SMS Administrator console is not
  running.

2. Replace the Ldwmnt.dll file in the &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Bin\I386 folder with the
  version from the hotfix.
