SYMPTOMS
========

After you restart a Windows NT-based computer, the following event ID messages
may be logged in the System log in Event Viewer:

  Event ID: 3870
  Source: Workstation
  &lt;ComputerName&gt; is not a valid computer name.

  -and-

  Event ID: 7023
  Source: Service Control Manager Error
  The Workstation service terminated with the following error:
  A duplicate name exists on the network.

  -and-

  Event ID: 2504
  Source: Server
  Description: The server could not bind to the transport
  Device\Netbt_&lt;AdapterName&gt;

  -and-

  Event ID: 7002
  Source: Service Control Manager
  The TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper service depends on the NetworkProvider group and no
  member of this group started.

  -and-

  Event ID: 7009
  Source: Service Control Manager
  Description: Timeout (120000 milliseconds) waiting for service to connect.

  -and-

  Event ID: 7001
  Source: Service Control Manager
  The Messenger service depends on the Workstation service which failed to start
  because of the following error:
  A duplicate name exists on the network.

  -and-

  Event ID: 7001
  Source: Service Control Manager Error
  The Alerter service depends on the Workstation service which failed to start
  because of the following error:
  A duplicate name exists on the network.

  -and-

  Event ID: 7001
  Source: Service Control Manager Error
  The Computer Browser service depends on the Workstation service, which failed
  to start because of the following error:
  A duplicate name exists on the network.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if any one of the following conditions is true:

- The computer has two network adapters and both network adapters attempt to
  register the same NetBIOS name with the Microsoft Windows Internet Naming
  Service (WINS).

  -or-

- A static entry exists in the WINS database.

  -or-

- There is a problem with a hardware component of the network, for example, a
  switch or router.

RESOLUTION
==========

To troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

1. If your computer is multiple-homed, disable the NetBEUI protocol that is
  bound to one of the network adapters.

  For additional information about how to disable the NetBEUI protocol, click
  the article numbers below to view the articles in the Microsoft Knowledge
  Base:

  Q197157 Workstation Service Does Not Start

  Q103470 NetBIOS Name Conflicts When NetBEUI Used on Multiple NICs

  If you continue to receive the event ID messages that are described in the
  "Symptoms" section of this article after you disable the NetBEUI protocol, go
  to step 2.

2. Determine if the WINS database contains static mappings.

  If a static entry exists, remove it, and then restart the computer. For
  additional information about how to remove static WINS entries, click the
  article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q177140 How to Remove Static WINS Entries from All WINS Servers

  If you continue to receive the event ID messages that are described in the
  "Symptoms" section of this article after you remove the static WINS entries,
  go to step 3.

3. Disconnect the network cable from the computer, and then restart the
  computer.

  If you no longer receive the event ID messages that are described in the
  "Symptoms" section of this article, investigate possible network issues. For
  example, remove or disable the network components one by one to isolate the
  cause of this behavior, and then test to determine whether the event ID
  messages occur again.
