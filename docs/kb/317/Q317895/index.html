The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.1 
- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A cross-site scripting (CSS) vulnerability exists in Internet Information
Services (IIS) 5.0 and 5.1. Through this vulnerability, an attacker can send a
request to an affected server that causes a Web page that contains script to be
sent to another user. The script executes in the user's browser as though it
comes from the third-party site, which lets the script run by using the security
settings that are appropriate to the third-party Web site, and also permits the
attacker to access any data that belongs to the site.

This vulnerability can only be exploited if the user opens a Hypertext Markup
Language (HTML) mail message or visited Web site of a malicious user. The code
cannot be "injected" into an existing session.

CAUSE
=====

This vulnerability occurs because a search facility that permits IIS Help files
to be searched does not properly validate all inputs before using them.
