The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Internet Mail Service may unexpectedly stop and it cannot be restarted. If
you examine the Application Event log, you may see the following events in the
Application Event log:

  4116

  An error was returned from the messaging software the Internet Mail Service
  uses to process messages on the Microsoft Exchange Server. It is possible
  that the piece of mail being processed at the time will not be delivered. The
  message that was being processed has been moved to the "BAD" folder. Use the
  appropriate utilities found in the SUPPORT directory of your Exchange CD to
  view and manipulate these messages.

  4102

  A serious error has occurred while trying to send mail into the Exchange
  Information Store. The Internet Mail Service is being shut down.

CAUSE
=====

This issue may occur in one of the following scenarios:

- Antivirus software is installed and running on the server.


- The server is running out of available disk space on the partition where the
  Imcdata folder is located.

- Your server installation needs to be updated with the latest release of the
  service pack and any hotfixes for Store.exe that may be available.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the available disk space on the drive where the Imcdata folder is
  located. To free up more space, use any or all of the following procedures:

   - Remove unnecessary programs.
   - Empty the Recycle Bin.
   - Delete files in all temporary directories.
   - Remove any unnecessary files from the Imcdata\Log folder.
   - Move the Imcdata folder to another drive or another partition.

2. If your SMTP Protocol Log appears to occupy a significant portion of the
  partition, change the logging level to a lower setting. To do this, follow
  these steps:

  a. Start the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program.

  b. Click your server, click Properties on the File menu, and then click the
     Diagnostic Logging tab.

  c. Locate the SMTP protocol, and then change its logging setting to a lower
     value.

3. Turn off or remove any antivirus software that may be running on your
  computer.

4. Locate and delete a bad message that may be causing the information store to
  stop responding. To do this, follow these steps:

  a. Stop the Internet Mail Service.

  b. Move all messages from the C:\Exchange\Imcdata\In folder to another folder
     (for example, create a folder named C:\Messages to move the messages to).

  c. Move the messages back to C:\Exchange\Imcdata\In one message at a time. If
     the number of messages is large, you can move them in small groups.

  d. Delete the Queue.dat file from the Imcdata folder.

  e. Restart the Internet Mail Service.

     If a bad message was placed in the Imcdata\In folder, the information store
     stops responding immediately.

  f. Repeat steps a through e until you locate and delete the bad message.

5. Use the information from the following Knowledge Base article to change the
  Max Threads(Private+Public) registry setting:

6. Apply the latest service pack and the most current Exchange Information Store
  service (Store.exe) hot fixes.
