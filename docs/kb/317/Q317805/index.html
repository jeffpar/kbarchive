SUMMARY
=======

Starting with Host Integration Server 2000, Host Integration Server 2000 clients
close their sponsor connections after five minutes and rely upon a "On Demand"
(dynamic) sponsor connection. SNA clients before Host Integration Server 2000
used "persistent" sponsor connection.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After a Host Integration Server 2000 client establishes a sponsor connection to
either an SNA server or Host Integration Server computer, the sponsor connection
is closed after 5 minutes. This change was implemented because the client does
not require a sponsor connection (by using port 1478) on a constant basis.

This has no effect on application sessions that communicate with the SNA/Host
Integration Server computer by using port 1477. The only circumstances where
this does not apply are:

- If an invokable Transaction Program (TP) is running on the client.

- If SNA Manager is running on an administrative client.

- If the SNA LU6.2 Resync TP service is running on an administrative client.

Under the preceding conditions, the client uses a persistent sponsor connection.
After the On Demand sponsor connection is closed, it will only be re-opened by
the SNABase when it needs to send an RPC request (for example, to locate which
servers support the requested SNA/Host Integration Server resource). During this
time, the client updates its Service Table (ST) whenever the connection is
reopened, but then closes again after the five-minute timeout expires. There is
no way to turn off the use of the On Demand sponsor connection.
