SUMMARY
=======

Many Microsoft games and hardware have cash-back rebate offers. This article
tells you how to locate rebate information for Microsoft products.

NOTE: The products listed at the beginning of this article may not currently
offer rebates. For the latest rebates, see the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/insider/rebates/

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the United States and Canada, if you have questions about a cash-back rebate
offer, do one of the following:

- See the Online Microsoft Consumer Rebate Center at the following Microsoft
  Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/insider/rebates/

- Call the appropriate Microsoft Rebate Center for the product in question
  (8:00 a.m. until 7:30p.m. EST, except weekends and holidays). No rebates will
  be authorized over the phone.

Please allow six to eight weeks for delivery of your rebate.

Offer valid only in the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, all U.S.
military bases that contain valid APO/FPO addresses, and Canada. Offer not valid
in U.S. Territories, including Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, or Guam. Offer
void where prohibited, taxed, or restricted by law. Only original coupons will
be accepted.

Contact the Rebate Center for any of the following issues or concerns:

- Your rebate coupon is missing. Note that rebate information is included
  either inside the product box or on a sticker on the outside of the box.

- The rebate information is incomplete or incorrect. For example, the rebate
  address is missing from the coupon. Please note that some coupons have two
  portions, and the information that you need may be on the second portion.

- You never received the rebate. Note that only one rebate is allowed per
  household per product (unless otherwise stated). If you purchase multiple
  copies of the same product, you will receive only one rebate for that
  purchase.

- You want to check on the status of your rebate. Please remember to allow six
  to eight weeks for delivery of your rebate check.

Microsoft will not share the information that you provide with third parties
without your permission, except where necessary to complete the services or
transactions you requested, or as required by law.
