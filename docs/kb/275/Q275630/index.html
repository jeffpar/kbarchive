-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2, versions 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a DTS package is built to export a SQL Server table to DB2/MVS (version 5.1)
by using the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for DB2 (DB2OLEDB) and the AUTOCOMMIT
property of the provider is set to FALSE, the following error may be reported:

  [OLE/DB provider returned message: A SQL error has occurred. Please consult
  the documentation for your specific DB2 version for a description of the
  associated Native Error and SQL State. SQLSTATE: 24501, SQLCODE: -501]

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

Set the AUTOCOMMIT property of the provider to TRUE.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version
4.0.

This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can apply the hotfix to resolve the error message that is shown in the
"Symptoms" section, however, for the DTS export or import to work correctly, the
AUTOCOMMIT property of DB2OLEDB must be set to TRUE.

If you set the AUTOCOMMIT property of the provider to FALSE, a COMMIT may never
be issued, and therefore the inserts are rolled back. Users can still work
around this behavior by writing their own transformation script for use with
DTS, to issue a commit after every few inserts.
