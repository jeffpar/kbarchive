SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to troubleshoot a "STOP 0x0000001E
KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED" error message.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A "STOP 0x0000001E KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED" error message is a common type
of STOP error message you may receive on a Windows NT-based computer. A "STOP
0x0000001E KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED" error message indicates that an error
condition was detected by the kernel and Windows NT was unable to continue
running because of this error condition. The types of problems that can cause a
"STOP 0x0000001E KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED" error message are very similar to
the problems that cause a "STOP 0x0000000A" error message, such as bad pointers,
invalid addresses and other types of access violations. The STOP 0x0000001E bug
check identifies an error that occurred in a section of code where no error
handling routines exist. Note that most exceptions are generated directly in the
section of code that is running.

The top four lines of a STOP 0x0000001E generally appear as:

  STOP: 0x0000001E (0xAAAAAAAA,0xBBBBBBBB,0xCCCCCCCC,0xDDDDDDDD)
  KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED
  AAAAAAAAA from BBBBBBBB (CCCCCCCC,DDDDDDDD)
  Address BBBBBBBB has base at XXXXXXXX - MODULE1.SYS Address CCCCCCCC has base
  at YYYYYYYY - MODULE2.SYS

The four hexadecimal parameters after the STOP code (0xAAAAAAAA, 0xBBBBBBBB,
0xCCCCCCCC, 0xDDDDDDDD) have the following meanings:

- 0xAAAAAAAA is a code that identifies the exception that was not handled.

- 0xBBBBBBBB is the address at which the exception occurred.

- 0xCCCCCCCC is the first parameter of the exception, and sometimes this is
  another address in code.

- 0xDDDDDDDD is the second parameter of the exception, which can vary in
  meaning.

Interpreting the Parameters
---------------------------

Usually the exception address identifies the driver or function that caused the
problem. Always note this address and the date of the driver or image that
contains this address.

The first parameter is a Windows NT error code, and all error codes are defined
in the Ntstatus.h file (which can also be found in the Windows NT 4.0 SDK). The
first parameter tells you the type of error.

The second parameter is also important because it tells you in what code module
the error occurred. This can frequently point to an individual driver or piece
of hardware that is at fault, which will generally be listed on the third line
of the STOP screen.

The last two parameters vary depending upon the exception that has occurred.
Typically, you can find a description of the parameters included with the name
of the error code in the Ntstatus.h file.

If there where no parameters to the error code, these will be 0x00000000.

For example, in the following STOP error message, an access violation
(0xC0000005) occurred in module Srv.sys, which is the kernel mode server
service:

  STOP: 0x0000001E (0xC0000005, 0xFCA733B9, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)
  KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED 0xC0000005 from 0xFCA733B9 (0x0, 0x0)Address
  FCA733B9 has base at FCA70000 - SRV.SYS

Note that no parameters went with this error code.

How to Troubleshoot a "STOP 0x0000001E KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED" Error Message
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Try to replace the driver that is identified in the STOP error message,
  either with a known good copy from your installation media, or with an
  updated version from the manufacturer.

2. Disable the driver that is identified in the STOP error message or any newly
  installed drivers.

3. Verify that any new hardware or software is properly installed. Disconnect
  the new hardware or replace it to see if this resolves the issue.

4. If you have a video driver that was not supplied with the operating system,
  try switching to the standard VGA driver or a driver that is compatible with
  the operating system.

5. View the following Microsoft Hardware Compatibility List Web site to verify
  that all your hardware and drivers are compatible with the operating system:

  http://www.microsoft.com/hcl

6. Run any system diagnostics that are supplied by your computer manufacturer,
  especially a RAM check. If this is a new installation of the hardware or
  software, contact the manufacturer for any requires updates for drivers or
  firmware.

7. Disable all filter drivers, such as remote control software, antivirus
  programs, backup programs, and so on.
