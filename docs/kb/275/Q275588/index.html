SYMPTOMS
========

When you collect performance data and the network adapter is disabled, the
following error message may be logged in the Application event log:

  Event ID: 3101 - Unable to read control Information from NBT device.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if Windows NT 4.0 recognises the network card as always
present and always active. If you do not receive the error message that is
mentioned in the "Symptoms" section, the level was changed so that the problem
is reported as a warning (yellow) and not an error (red).


RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT 4.0 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services

update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
