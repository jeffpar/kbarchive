  wheel Init() failed: HRESULT 80042008

  C:\refdev01\shared\sharedfind\source\sharedfindCTRL.cpp (471):Failed to
  CoCreate Instance CLSID_SharedFindMGR: HRESULT 0x80010105 The server threw an
  exception.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if any of the following conditions are true:

- The program CD-ROM or DVD-ROM is dirty or damaged.

- You are running one or more memory-resident programs that interfere with the
  operation of the program.

- Certain files on your computer are missing or damaged.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following methods in the order in which they are
presented.

Clean the CD-ROM
----------------

Clean the CD-ROM. To do this, use a CD-ROM cleaning kit, or gently wipe the
silver side of the CD-ROM with a soft, lint-free cotton cloth. Do not use paper
cloth which can scratch the plastic and leave streaks. When you clean the
CD-ROM, wipe from the center of the disc outward. Do not use a circular motion.

If the issue continues to occur, clean the CD-ROM with a damp cloth or a
commercial CD cleaning solution. Dry the CD-ROM thoroughly before you insert it
into the CD-ROM drive.


If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Clean the CD-ROM Drive
----------------------

If cleaning the CD-ROM does not resolve the issue, clean the CD-ROM drive using a
CD-ROM drive cleaning disc if you have one. If you do not have one, obtain one
after all other steps in this article have failed to resolve the issue. CD-ROM
drive cleaning discs are available in most computer stores.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Run the Encarta Repair Feature
------------------------------

1. Quit all programs that are running on your computer.

2. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

3. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

4. Click the Microsoft Encarta program that you want to repair, and then click
  Add/Remove.

5. Click Next.
