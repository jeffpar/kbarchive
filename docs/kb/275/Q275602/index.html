CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because when you restore an earlier online backup to an
empty Mdbdata folder (or restore an earlier online backup with the "erase all
existing data" option) and start the Information Store service, a new Edb.log
file is created with the current log generation. After you copy the saved
transaction logs back to the Mdbdata folder, the transaction logs seem to be in
the correct sequence; however, the copied transaction logs' generation number is
equal to or greater than the Edb.log file number.

One of the transaction logs has the same log generation as the Edb.log file.
Because of the already existing corresponding log, the Edb.log file cannot be
renamed into the next number after the Edb.log file reaches 5 megabytes (MB).
This causes the information store to stop and leaves the databases in an
inconsistent state.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, you can use one of the two following methods. You lose
data with both methods. The amount of data that you lose depends on the
situation, and cannot be foreseen.

Method 1
--------

This is the fastest method, but this method is likely to involve more data loss.

1. Run the eseutil /ml command on the Edb.log file to find out the log
  generation number of the Edb.log file.

2. Delete all transaction logs that are equal to or greater than the Edb.log
  file number. Start the information store again.

Method 2
--------

This method is more time consuming, but in most cases involves less data loss.

1. Restore the information store databases from an online backup again (either
  restore the databases to an empty Mdbdata folder or click "erase existing
  data").

2. Copy the transaction logs that were saved before in the first online backup
  to the Mdbdata folder.

3. Make sure that the log files are concurrent in number, and then start the
  information store again.

NOTE: Transaction logs can only be replayed into the database during a
restoration operation before you start the service.
