-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An expected Internet Information Server (IIS) log in the
%systemroot%\System32\Logfiles folder is not created.

The following log entry may appear in the Event Viewer:

  Event ID: 2
  Source: IISLog
  "Cannot Create Directory"

Note: Garbage is listed in place of the name that was not initialized. It is
possible in this scenario to have hundreds of these errors present in the event
logs.

CAUSE
=====

During system startup, IIS attempts to initialize the IIS logs. When the open is
attempted it can happen that the metabase is locked exclusively for some time.
As a result, the attempt to access the metabase fails and the IIS log cannot be
initialized. If the metabase is available immediately, this problem does not
occur.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, start IIS and all dependency services manually
following system initialization.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date      Time    Version      Size    File name     Platform
