-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a user makes a request to a Web server, Internet Information Services (IIS)
5.0 may go into an infinite loop. This problem can occur if the IISADMPWD
virtual directory is configured to require authentication that is not Anonymous
and the user's password has either expired or has been configured so that the
user must change their password at the next logon. The PasswordChangeFlags in
the metabase must also be set to enable password change notifications.

CAUSE
=====

When you have IIS configured to support password change notifications, IIS
notifies a user whose password is about to expire, has expired, or has been
configured to force the user to change their password at the next logon. IIS
does this by redirecting the user to either a page that informs them that the
password is about to expire, or to a page that states that their password has
expired. In Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0, this redirect occurs
internally. IIS 5.0 uses a 302 redirect, which forces a brand new request from
the client, and subsequently, if authentication is required on the IISADMPWD
virtual directory, a new logon attempt occurs. For a password that has expired,
or must be changed at the next logon, the logon fails and IIS redirects again,
which causes an infinite loop.

WORKAROUND
==========

Allow Anonymous access on the IISADMPWD virtual directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows 2000. For
