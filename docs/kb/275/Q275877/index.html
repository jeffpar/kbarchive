SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 with Service Pack 1 (SP1) is
included with Microsoft BackOffice Server version 4.5. However, you need SMS
Service Pack 2 (SP2) to install SMS 2.0 on a computer that is running Microsoft
Windows 2000 or later.

Microsoft provides the SMS SP2 on its Web site and FTP locations. The
installation process for the online update is to apply the patch to the original
SMS source by using the downloaded service pack. For additional information,
click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q268803 SMS: Problems Upgrading SMS 2.0 to Service Pack 2 with the Web Patch

However, to apply the service patch to the BackOffice Server 4.5 SMS source, you
need the SP2 CD-ROM because you are unable to use the service pack that you can
download online.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft provides the Readiness Kit for Windows 2000, which contains necessary
service pack software and online documentation for upgrading BackOffice Server
4.5 to Windows 2000 Server, and for freshly installing BackOffice Server 4.5
onto an existing Windows 2000 server.

Note: SMS 2.0 with SP2 is not included with the BackOffice Server 4.5 Readiness
Kit for Windows 2000. If you plan to use SMS on your BackOffice Server 4.5
computer, a full installation of SMS 2.0 with SP2 is required for completing
these steps. You can order this by phone. To order a full installation of
Systems Management Server 2.0 SP2, call (800) 329-9015 (U.S. and Canadian
customers only).
