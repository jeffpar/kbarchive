-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING: This utility is used for creating or moving individual Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 or Microsoft Windows 2000 print servers. Do not use it to upgrade a Windows NT 4.0 print server to a Windows 2000 print server.

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Printer Migrator 2000 (Printmig.exe version 2.0) is included with the
Microsoft Windows 2000 Resource Kit Supplement version 1.0. However, the Help
file that is included with this supplement is for use with Printmig.exe version
1.0. This article provides Help information for Printmig.exe version 2.0.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Overview
--------

Printer Migrator 2000 (Printmig.exe) performs a complete printer configuration
backup of a Windows NT 4.0-based or Windows 2000-based computer. This backup
data is stored in a user-specified .cab file. If Printmig.exe is enabled (by
default, it is enabled), Printmig.exe also writes status information to the
Pm.log file in the %SystemRoot%\System32\Spool\Pm folder. The following data is
backed up to the .cab file:

- Printers

- Defined print queues in Windows NT and Windows 2000

- Print monitor ports

  NOTE: Printmig.exe recognizes and backs up the following ports:

   - Hewlett-Packard network port

   - LexMark MarkVision port monitor (IP/DLC)

   - Jet Admin

   - LPR port

   - Local ports

   - Digital network port

   - Apple Talk port monitor

   - Standard port monitor

- Printer driver platforms for Windows NT 4.0: x86, Alpha, Mips, PPC. Printer
  driver platforms for Windows 2000: x86.

- Share point information. Note that all file shares, print shares, and user
  permissions are backed up. Also, by default, only print shares are restored.

NOTE: Printer Migrator 2000 does not back up the actual monitor, instead, it only
backs up the defined ports. Prior to the restoration operation, you must
reinstall the original set of port monitors to ensure complete functionality.
Printer Migrator 2000 generates a warning message for each monitor that is not
present after the restoration. However this information is only written to the
log file if you use the -i switch, or if you previously clicked to select the
Suppress Warning Popups check box.

Features That Are Included in Printmig.exe Version 2.0 But Not Version 1.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Merge Configurations:

In Restore mode, Printer Migrator version 1.0 performed a printer configuration
registry overwrite of the target computer. Because of this, any existing printer
configuration would be lost after the Printer Migrator restoration process
finishes. The majority of development efforts for Printmig.exe version 2.0 have
been dedicated to the registry-merging code upon a restoration. By merging
registry information, printer configurations can be merged (this is the default
behavior) or overwritten. To overwrite printer configurations, use the /o switch
(in combination with the /r switch) or click to select the "Replace (overwrite)
existing print shares" check box in the Restore dialog box.

Full Operation from a Command Prompt:

Because you can start Microsoft Printer Migrator version 2000 from a command
prompt, you can use it with a script. Several switches have been added to
Printer Migrator 2000 version 2.0 that are not included in version 1.0, and you
can view these switches by using the /? switch. Note that if you start
Printmig.exe from a command prompt, the user interface also starts, but it
automatically shuts down when the operation is complete. The following list
provides a description of the different switches you can use with Printmig.exe:

- -?

  This switch was introduced in version 1.0. The /? switch displays the
  available switches.

- -d

  The disable spooler switch was introduced in version 1.0. The /d switch
  disables the spooler. When you use the /d switch, Printer Migrator does not
  allow any backup or restore activity, but enumerates the target computer and
  populates the tree view with related information. Use the /d switch if you
  are unable to gain access to the target computer when the spooler is started
  and you want to check which printers are installed. This switch is provided
  in case you do not have sufficient access permissions to modify spooler
  information.

- -b

  The backup switch causes Printmig.exe to backup the printer configuration
  information of a Windows NT 4.0-based or Windows 2000-based computer. Note
  that if you do not specify the target computer name (in the form of
  \\computer name), the local computer is implied.

- -f

  The file name switch determines the file name to read from or write to, and
  this depends on whether you use the /r or /b switch. In either case, the file
  name directly follows the switch. For file names or paths with spaces, the
  complete file name and path must be enclosed in quotation marks.

- -r

  The restore switch causes Printmig.exe to restore the specified printer
  configuration of a Windows NT 4.0-based or Windows 2000-based computer to a
  Windows NT 4.0-based or Windows 2000-based computer. Note that Printmig.exe
  2.0 does not allow restoration from a Windows NT 4.0-based computer to a
  Windows 2000-based computer or from a Windows 2000-based computer to a
  Windows NT 4.0-based computer. Like Printmig.exe 1.0, Printmig.exe 2.0 only
  allows like platform restorations for Windows NT 4.0-based computers (for
  example, x86 to x86). Also, the default for the /r switch is to merge the
  printer configuration from the .cab file to the existing printer
  configuration on the target.

- -o

  The overwrite switch (in combination with the /r switch) causes the target
  server to be overwritten with the printer configuration information that is
  contained in the .cab file that is specified by the /f switch.

- -s

  The restore file shares switch merges the file shares in the .cab file with
  the existing file shares that exist on the target.

- -p

  The restore user permissions switch merges the user permissions in the .cab
  file with the existing user permissions on the target.

- -i

  The suppress warning popups switch disables warning dialog boxes that require
  user intervention, such as OK, Cancel, and so on. Note that the warnings are
  still written to the log file. You should use this switch when you use a
  script to start Printmig.exe.

Terminal Services Aware:

Printmig.exe 1.0 was not Terminal Services aware for restorations. Instead,
version 1.0 would target the %SystemRoot% folder on a per-user basis, even
though it needed to use a system-wide basis. This has been corrected with
Printmig.exe 2.0, and is transparent when you restore to a computer that is
running Terminal Services.

Scheduling:

Printmig.exe has been fully tested with the Mstask.exe tool, and all known
scheduling bugs have been fixed. For example, no one needs to be logged in for
the program to operate successfully operate.

Multi-Threaded Graphical User Interface:

Printmig.exe 2.0 is multithreaded, so the tool should not stop responding (hang)
during a long operation. Do not attempt to run simultaneous backups or
restorations with a single instance of Printmig.exe 2.0. Instead, you must run
separate instances of Printmig.exe 2.0 to perform simultaneous backups or
restorations from a single computer.

Usage
-----

Backup:

When you use Printmig.exe 2.0 to back up the printer configuration of a Windows
NT-based or Windows 2000-based computer, you must specify the .cab file location
and name that Printmig.exe will create. Optionally, you can specify the target
server.

To create a backup from a command prompt, use the -b switch and the -f [file
name] switch. Optionally, you can specify the target computer name as the last
parameter of the command in the \\server name form. To create a backup from with
the program:

1. Click Backup on the Actions menu.

2. Manually enter the path and file name of the .cab file to be created, or
  browse to the desired folder and type the file name.

3. Click Save, and then click OK to begin the back up procedure.

As the backup command runs, a progress report is displayed in the lower portion
of the Printer Migrator window. The contents of this report are saved in the
Pm.log file that is located in the %SystemRoot%\System32\Spool\Pm folder. After
this process completes, the .cab file contains the related printer registry data
and spooler files.

Restore:

When you use Printmig.exe 2.0 to restore a printer configuration to a Windows NT
4.0-based or Windows 2000-based computer, the default behavior is to merge the
configuration from the .cab file to the existing configuration on the target
computer. Note that this behavior differs from Printmig.exe 1.0 which overwrites
the existing configuration on the target with the configuration from the .cab
file. To overwrite with Printmig.exe 2.0, use the -o switch or click to select
the "Replace (overwrite) existing print shares" check box in the Restore dialog
box.

To restore from a command prompt, use the -r and the -f [filename] switches.
Optionally, you can specify the target computer name as the last parameter of
the command in the \\server name form.

To restore from within the program:

1. Click Restore on the Actions menu.

2. Open the folder that contains the existing .cab file.

3. Type the name of the .cab file you want to read in the File Name box.
  Optionally, you can specify the computer name in the \\server name form.

4. Select any options you want to use, such as "Suppress warning popups",
  "Replace existing file shares", "Restore user permissions", and "Restore file
  shares".

5. Click Open to begin the restoration process.

IMPORTANT: Printmig.exe temporarily stops the spooler (and MacPrint, if it is
started) on the target computer to restore print queue information. Also, before
you run the "Restore" (without the quotation marks) command on a print server,
verify that the following requirements are satisfied:

- The backup computer and the target computer must both be running the same
  operating system and use the same platform such as x86, Alpha, and so on.

- Print monitor information is consistent with the backup computer. If a
  monitor is missing, Printer Migrator generates a warning message, and you
  must install the monitor or service to run the restoration again.

- The current user must have administrative rights on the target computer.

As the "Restore" (without the quotation marks) command runs, a progress report is
displayed in the lower portion of the Printer Migrator window. The contents of
this report are saved in the Pm.log file that is located in the
%SystemRoot%\System32\Spool\Pm folder.

Note that Printmig.exe 2.0 is backwards compatible with .cab files that were
created by Printmig.exe 1.0, but not the other way around.

Log File:

The log file records detailed information about backups, restorations, and errors
that were encountered. The Pm.log log file is stored in the
%SystemRoot%\System32\Spool\Pm folder. Warnings and errors are still logged even
if these items are disabled. Log To Text is enabled by default on the Options
menu. Click this command to disable logging to a text file. However, note that
all of this information is still displayed in the lower portion of the Printer
Migrator logging window.

View:

The Target and Restore Local commands enumerate print queue information in a tree
view format. The title bar identifies the computer that corresponds to the
currently displayed tree view. Note that this computer is the target of all
subsequent operations.

To enumerate a remote computer and populate the tree view:

1. Click Target on the View menu.

2. In the Target Server box, type the name of the target server, for example,
  \\server1.

To enumerate the local computer and populate the tree view, click Restore Local
on the View menu.
