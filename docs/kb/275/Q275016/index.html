-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On Windows NT-based Systems Management Server (SMS) client computers that have
the Microsoft Windows CE Platform Builder add-on installed, you may receive
access violation error messages in the Odpusr32.exe, Smsapm32.exe, and
Smsmon32.exe programs.

NOTE: On client computers that experience this problem, software distribution is
not functional.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because there is a fault in the method that is used by the
SMS client to detect an interactive user session. The Platform Builder add-on
adds numerous performance monitor counters to the computer. Some of these
additional counters have duplicate names to those that are used by SMS. Because
the counters have duplicate names, the SMS client accesses the incorrect
information.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q288239 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 3.
