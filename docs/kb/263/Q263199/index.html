SUMMARY
=======

Exchange Server administrators may want to divide an organization into
departments for Internet mail, and Exchange Server users may want to receive
mail as &lt;user_name&gt;@&lt;department&gt;.&lt;company&gt;.com. An example of
this type of Internet address is user1@example.microsoft.com. This article
describes how to divide an organization into departments for Internet mail.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To divide an organization into departments for Internet mail:

1. Confirm that all users are receiving e-mail messages in the
  &lt;user_name&gt;@&lt;company&gt;.com format. This will confirm that the A
  record and Mail Exchanger (MX) records are properly configured on the Domain
  Name System (DNS), which can be local or in the site of the Internet service
  provider (ISP).

For additional information the A and MX records, click the article number below
to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q153001 XFOR: DNS MX Records and CNAMEs

2. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, click Configuration, click
  Connections, and then double-click Internet Mail Service.

3. Click the Routing tab, and then click "Reroute incoming SMTP mail". Click
  Add, type the new domain name (&lt;department&gt;.&lt;company&gt;.com) and
  leave the other settings at the default settings. This record looks like the
  other exiting records (for example, example.microsoft.com).

For additional information about adding a routing domain name, click the article
number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q174351 XFOR: How to Configure Exchange with Secondary SMTP Addresses

4. Add an MX record on the DNS with the new domain name
  (&lt;department&gt;.&lt;company&gt;.com). For additional information about
  the extra A and MX records, click the article number below to view the
  article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q196927 XIMS: How to Configure a Single Domain with Connected Sites via IMS

  Confirm that the A and MX records are correct by running the NSLookup utility.
  Let the DNS replicate with other DNS servers on the Internet. This can take
  from 24 to 48 hours.

5. For every mailbox, add a secondary Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
  address space with the e-mail address of
  &lt;user_name&gt;@&lt;department&gt;.&lt;company&gt;.com. In the
  Administrator program, double-click the mailbox to open the mailbox
  properties. Click the E-mail Address tab, click New, click Internet Address,
  and then click OK. Type
  "&lt;user_name&gt;@&lt;department&gt;.&lt;company&gt;.com" (without the
  quotation marks) as the e-mail address.

For additional information about how to automate this process for several users,
click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q155594 XADM: Generic Import Format to Add SMTP Secondary Proxy Address

6. After the DNS replication (24 to 48 hours), test to make sure that the
  configuration is correct by sending a message to the new SMTP address
  (&lt;user_name&gt;@&lt;department&gt;.&lt;company&gt;.com), and confirm that
  the user receives the message.
