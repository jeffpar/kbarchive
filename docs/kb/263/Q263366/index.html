-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

After you run Setup for Systems Management Server and select the "Modify or
reset the current installation" option on a Systems Management Server Service
Pack 2 (SP2) site, the following dialog box may appear, even when you are only
adding additional components:

  Warning:
  Do you want to reset the server connection account on this computer? The
  server connection account is the account the remote SMS services use to
  connect to the site server. If you have account lockout policy enabled, you
  might not want to reset the server connection account password now because
  doing so risks locking out the server connection account, which prevents
  remote SMS services from accessing the site server.

This dialog box was added in Systems Management Server SP2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have already reset the Server Connection account for Systems Management
Server, use the Access Control List (ACL) Reset tool (Aclreset.exe) to restore
access permissions.

For information about the Systems Management Server Recovery Tools and how to
obtain them, review the Tools section at the following Microsoft Web site:
http://www.microsoft.com/smsmgmt/techdetails/recovery/

Use the ACL Reset tool every time the server connection account is changed or
re-created.


About the Systems Management Server Connection Account
------------------------------------------------------

The Server Connection account is the account that Systems Management Servers run
on remote site systems (such as logon points), to connect to the site server. It
is used by the following:

- The Systems Management Server Windows NT Logon Discovery Agent service, to
  gain access to the site server when transferring discovery data.

- The Inbox Manager Assistant component of the Systems Management Server
  Executive service on remote Client Access Points (CAPs), to gain access to
  the site server when transferring data.

- Systems Management Server services running on remote site systems, to gain
  access to the Systems Management Server registry keys and specific
  directories on the site server.

- The Systems Management Server Provider, to gain access to the Systems
  Management Server directories on the site server, including the Portable
  Document Format (PDF) store.

Systems Management Server Setup creates the default Server Connection account
SMSServer_sitecode on the site server and adds it to the Domain Users group in
the site server's domain.
