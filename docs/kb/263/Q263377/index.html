-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install a Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 site, you may receive
"Access violation" error messages that list Sitecomp.exe.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Counter (REG_MULTI_SZ) value in he following
registry key contains an empty (null) string, or is damaged:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Perflib\009

The value may be similar to:

  .
  .
  .
  1858
  Committed pages
  1860
  Procedure cache pages in use
  1862

  1864
  Free buffers
  1866
  Lazy Writes
  .
  .
.

The error message occurs when Site Component Manager reads the unexpected string
value. The damage may have been caused if you previously stopped an SMS
installation before it was finished.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

If the registry damage is not significant and the Counter value simply contains
an empty string (as noted in the example), you can resolve the issue by changing
the empty string to a non-empty string such as ABCDEFG.

For example:

  .
  .
  .
  1858
  Committed pages
  1860
  Procedure cache pages in use
  1862
  ABCDEFG
  1864
  Free buffers
  1866
  Lazy Writes
  .
  .
.

If the registry damage is significant, you may have to reinstall Microsoft
Windows NT.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
