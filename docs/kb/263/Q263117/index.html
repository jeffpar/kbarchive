SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to a remote Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS)
computer that has more than one network card using the Microsoft Management
Console (MMC), a delay of approximately 30 seconds may occur on the first
connection. Subsequent connections are much quicker.

CAUSE
=====

The remote procedure call (RPC) returns the IP addresses for all of the network
interface cards (NICs) on the IIS server. The list is tried in the order in
which it is returned. If the first NIC returned is not reachable by the client
where MMC is run, the process keeps trying the first address until 32 seconds
have passed. After the timeout, it proceeds on down the list.


RESOLUTION
==========

The order in which the list is returned is controlled by the binding order on
the TCP/IP protocol. To alter the binding order on Microsoft Windows NT 4.0,
follow these steps:

1. Open the network control panel on the IIS Server.

2. Click the Bindings tab.

3. Select "Show Bindings for All Protocols".

4. Expand the TCP/IP protocol.

5. Highlight the NIC that you want at the top of the list, and then click Move
  Up until it is at the top of the list.

6. Restart the IIS server.

To alter the binding order on Microsoft Windows 2000, follow these steps:

1. Open the network control panel on the IIS Server.

2. Click Advanced on the menu, and then select Advanced Settings.

3. Highlight the NIC that you want at the top of the list, and then click the up
  arrow until the NIC is at the top of the list.

4. Click OK.
