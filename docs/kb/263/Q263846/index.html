-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a Microsoft Windows 2000-based server running Terminal Services in
Application Server mode, you attempt to install a secondary site from the
primary site using the Secondary Site Installation Wizard.

This attempted installation may cause the Smssetup.log file on the secondary site
to display the following log entry on your computer system:

  Setup has detected that Windows Terminal Server is running on this computer
  and the current user session is in the Execute mode. You must set the current
  user session to the Install mode in order to run Microsoft Systems Management
  Server (SMS) Setup.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the Terminal Services-based server is not in
Install mode when the SMS Setup program is run.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, perform the following instructions: when Terminal
Services is running in Application Server mode, the secondary site must be
installed on the local server directly from an SMS installation location.
However, before you use the SMS Setup program, run the change user /install
command.
