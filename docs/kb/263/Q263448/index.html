SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Mailbox Manager is included with Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3.
Mailbox Manager is a tool to implement corporate e-mail retention policies.
Features of Mailbox Manager include the following:

- Configuration flexibility. You can configure Mailbox Manager to delete
  messages according to message age, folder size, message type, and other
  parameters.

- Automation. You can create a weekly schedule that specifies when Mailbox
  Manager deletes messages from Exchange Server mailboxes.

- Report generation. You can configure Mailbox Manager to log detailed reports
  about message removal and other Mailbox Manager activities and to send the
  reports to administrators.

This article lists the versions of Exchange Server and Microsoft Windows NT
Server that must be installed for Mailbox Manager to work properly.
