-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you uninstall the Systems Management Server (SMS) client, reinstall the
SMS client, and then upgrade the SMS client from Service Pack 1 (SP1) to Service
Pack 2 (SP2) without restarting the client computer, hardware inventory on the
Microsoft Windows 9x clients is not re-enabled.

In Systems Management Server in Control Panel on the client computer, the
Hardware Inventory Agent component remains in the status of "Reboot Required."

When you run the Smsls.bat file, you receive an error message that the Clilog.dll
file was not found.

CAUSE
=====

When you uninstall the SMS client, some files are only removed after you restart
the computer. If you do not restart the computer, the files are not removed.
When you re-install the SMS client, new components are installed. When you
upgrade from SP1 to SP2, the Hardware Inventory Agent is disabled and marked to
be restarted. When you restart the computer, the files from the original
uninstallation procedure are removed and so are the files from the upgraded
installation. The Hardware Inventory Agent is not re-enabled because the enabler
cannot find the Clilog.dll file. Because the re-enabler runs only once, the
Hardware Inventory Agent is not re-enabled.

WORKAROUND
==========

When you uninstall the SMS client components by using the Systems Management
Installation Wizard (Smsman.exe) or the 20clicln.bat file, restart the computer
to complete the uninstallation procedure. After you restart the computer, you
can install the client normally.

You can also manually repair the Hardware Inventory Agent in Control Panel.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
