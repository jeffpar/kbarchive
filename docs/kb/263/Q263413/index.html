-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install Remote Control on a Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0
client on a Microsoft Windows 98/95-based computer, you may receive the
following error message:

  Cannot find the file \PCDDOS.EXE. Make sure that the file exists on your
  system and that the path and filename are correct.

While this message is displayed, the computer stops responding except for the
ability to dismiss the dialog box. After you close the dialog box, the client
installation continues normally. In some cases, a reboot may be required to
finish this installation.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur during the installation when the Remote Control component
looks for PCDDOS in the %windir% folder instead of the %sms_local_dir% folder.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, change the environment variable for sms_local_dir
to c:\windows.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.The third-party products discussed in
this article are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft; we make no
warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance or
reliability.
