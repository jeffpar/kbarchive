SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to install a Microsoft Windows 2000 print driver on a
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 print server for point and print functionality.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Section 1: Installing a Windows 2000 Print Driver
-------------------------------------------------

To install a Windows 2000 print driver on a Windows NT server, follow these steps
from a Windows 2000-based computer on your network:

NOTE: If you are using either a Windows NT 4.0 driver or a Windows 2000 driver
that is supplied by a third party, these steps may not work due to differences
in design or driver names.

You may also encounter errors when you are managing drivers on a Windows NT
4.0-based printer server from a Windows 2000-based computer. For additional
information, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q318577 You Receive an Error Message When You Manage a Windows NT 4.0 Printer
  Server from Windows 2000

1. Click Start, click Run, and then type the Uniform Naming Convention (UNC)
  path for the Windows NT 4.0 print server (for example: \\Nt4srvname).

  This action displays the shares on the remote computer.

2. Open the Printers folder. This action takes you into the printers folder on
  the remote computer.

3. Right-click the icon for the printer for which you want to add the Windows
  2000 driver, and then click Sharing.

4. From the Sharing tab, click Additional Drivers, click the "Intel/Windows
  2000" option, and then click OK.

Section 2: Verifying That the Drivers Are Installed
---------------------------------------------------

To verify that the drivers are installed, do one of the following:

From a Windows 2000-based computer:

1. While you are still viewing the Printers folder of the remote, Windows NT
  4.0-based computer, click File.

2. Select Server Properties, and then click the Drivers tab.

3. A list of installed printer drivers is displayed with the following
  properties:

  &lt;Printer_Name&gt; Intel Windows 2000 (Windows 2000 drivers)
  &lt;Printer_Name &gt; Intel Windows NT 4.0 or 2000 (Windows NT 4.0 drivers)

From a Windows NT 4.0-based computer:

1. Run Regedt32.exe and navigate to the registry of the Windows NT 4.0 computer.
  Open the following key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Environments\Windows
  NT x86\Drivers

2. Under this key, you should see the following two subkeys that list the
  drivers currently installed:

  Version-2 is for NT 4.0 drivers
  Version-3 is for 2000 drivers

NOTE: Windows 2000 print drivers can be installed simultaneously for all drivers
on a Windows NT 4.0 system using the Fixprnsv.exe file from the Windows 2000
Server CD-ROM.
