-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Extensible Storage Engine (ESE) fix that is described in
the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article

  Q254682 XADM: Exchange Server 5.5 Post-SP3 Database Engine Fixes

Cheyenne ARCserve 6.5 may not work when you back up Exchange Server databases.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because a new Edbbcli.dll file (version 5.5.2652.31) is
included in the ESE fix to resolve the issue that is described in the following
Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q243601 XADM: Backups Time Out on Large Databases when Database Scrubbing Is
  Enabled

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 service pack that contains
this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: ESE

+---------------------------+
| File name   | Version     | 
+---------------------------+
| Edbbcli.dll | 5.5.2652.45 | 
+---------------------------+



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, either remove the fix from the server that you want
to back up or replace the Edbbcli.dll file with the Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 3 (version 5.5.2650.17) version of the Edbbcli.dll file until the fix that
is described in this article is available.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack
3.
