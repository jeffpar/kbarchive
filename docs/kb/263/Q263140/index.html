-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to connect to a Web page that is running under Internet Information
Services (IIS) 5.0 on a Microsoft Windows 2000 Domain Controller by using
Anonymous or Basic authentication, the following error message may appear in the
Web browser, even when the proper permissions are set:

  HTTP 401.1 - Unauthorized: Logon Failed

CAUSE
=====

For security reasons, on Windows 2000 domain controllers, only the account
operators, administrators, backup operators, print operators, server operators,
Internet guest account, and Terminal Services user accounts have the Log on
Locally user right, which is a requirement for both Anonymous and Basic
authentication.

WORKAROUND
==========

IMPORTANT: Microsoft does not recommend running Internet Information Services on
a domain controller (or BDC/PDC if you are running Microsoft Windows NT Server
4.0), because IIS performance is severely degraded due to the networking and
processor load imposed by authentication and other roles performed by domain
controllers. For additional information, click the article number below to view
the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q197132 Windows 2000 Active Directory FSMO Roles

To work around this issue, perform the following steps:

1. Load the Domain Users and Computers snap-in.

2. Right-click the Users container, click New, and then select Group.

3. Configure this new group as follows:

   - Group Name: WebUsers

   - Group Scope: Domain Local

   - Group Type: Security

4. Click Next until the wizard is finished and the WebUsers group is created.

5. Add any users or groups that require access to your Web site to the WebUsers
  group.

6. Load the Domain Controller Security Policy snap-in.

7. In the left pane, click to expand Windows Settings, click to expand Security
  Settings, click to expand Local Policies, and then select User Rights
  Assignments.

8. Double-click the Log on locally user right.

9. Add the WebUsers group that you created in step 4.

10. Force the policy to take affect by issuing the following command:

  "secedit /refreshpolicy machine_policy /enforce" (without the quotation
  marks)

At this point, any account or group that is a member of the WebUsers group should
be able to log on to the IIS 5.0 server by using Basic authentication. With
Basic/Clear Text authentication, it is recommended that the data be encrypted
with SSL, as it is extremely easy to obtain credentials from a network trace.
