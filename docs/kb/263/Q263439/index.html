-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The online SMS Administrator's Guide refers to Service Pack 1 in multiple
locations where it should reference Service Pack 2. This online guide is located
in the Systems Management Server\Sms Administrator's Guide directory.

Examples:

Here are a few examples of documentation errors where Service Pack 1 should be
appear instead of Service Pack 2:

- In Appendix D, under "System Flow Charts":

  For updated system flow charts, see the Online Help for SMS 2.0, Service Pack
  1.

- Under the "Product Analyzer Compliance Analysis" topic:

  Compliance analysis using the Microsoft Year 2000 Product Analyzer involves
  multiple steps. As a prerequisite to compliance analysis, you must obtain the
  Year 2000 Product Analyzer from Microsoft. It is included in the SMS 2.0 SP1
  compact disc and is installed automatically when you install the Product
  Compliance feature. Or, you can download it from
  http://www.microsoft.com/technet/year2k/resources/resources.htm.

  The downloadable version of the product is likely to contain more up-to-date
  database information than the version provided with SMS 2.0 SP1.

- Under "Distribute the Year 2000 Product Analyzer" in the "Product Analyzer
  Compliance Analysis Step 1" topic:

  Select the "Create a new package from a definition" option. SMS 2.0 SP1
  contains a template for creating this package. The wizard will offer you a
  scrolling list of package definitions. Look for "Year 2000 Product Analyzer"
  and select it.

- In the "Determining Product Compliance" topic:

  The second tool is the Microsoft Year 2000 Product Analyzer. This is a
  stand-alone tool that ships with SMS SP1.

- Under "Run Queries" in the "Product Analyzer Compliance Analysis Step 4"
  topic:

  The Resource Explorer displays Y2K information for one system at a time. Use
  the SMS queries to aggregate the Y2K information across systems. SMS 2.0 SP1
  comes with several compliance queries intended for use with the Year 2000
  Product Analyzer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
