SUMMARY
=======

When a public information store is restored to a server that has a different
name, the following event is generated:

  Event Type: Information
  Event Source: MSExchangeIS
  Event Category: Recovery
  Event ID: 1117
  Date: 11/13/2000
  Time: 10:35:33 AM
  User: N/A
  Computer: WARDF01
  Description:
  The public database has been restored to an alternate server. This database
  will no longer be able to replicate with other public databases.

This article describes the limitations of a public information store when it is
restored to a different server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use the DS/IS consistency adjuster to rehome public folders when the
Pub.edb database is restored to a server that has a different name. The Exchange
Server computer must have the same organization and site name as the server that
the Pub.edb database came from. When folders are rehomed to another Exchange
Server computer, you must also add the folder to the Instances tab to see the
properties of that folder in the Exchange Server Administrator program. The
Instances tab is located in the properties of the Public Information Store
object in the Exchange Server Administrator program.

Even though you can set up folders to replicate, the contents of a folder that
once belonged to another server do not replicate to other public information
stores. If a server is set up as a replica, you can see the folder from a client
on the replica site, but none of the contents are displayed in the folder.
Servers that have an affinity set up or users in the local site can still see
the contents of the folder.

Note that new postings to the folder can be replicated, and postings that are
added to other replica servers replicate back to this home server. New public
folders that are created on this information store also work as usual.
Therefore, you can copy all of the contents of an existing folder to a newly
created folder, and then have the old data replicated to the newly created
folder. Keep in mind that you need to manually assign any permissions to the new
folder.

Another limitation to folders that once belonged to another server is that no
subfolders can be added to these folders.
