-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Microsoft Exchange Server Setup program to join an existing site,
when you type the server name of the site that you want to join, a dialog box
displays the service account that the existing server is currently using.
Sometimes it displays only the service account name instead of both the domain
name and the service account name. Setup then stops, and you receive the
following error message:

  Microsoft Exchange Server Setup
  Processing file &lt;file path&gt;\server.ins, at or near line 276
  No mapping between account names and security Ids was done.
  Microsoft Windows NT
  ID no: 0xc0020534

This behavior also occurs when the two servers are in the same domain, and the
new Microsoft Windows NT-based server is set up as a backup domain controller
(BDC) of this domain. When you use the service account to log on to the new
server, the behavior remains unchanged.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the Exchange Server account, in any of the
Microsoft Exchange-related services, is set to &lt;service account name&gt; and
not &lt;domain name&gt;\&lt;service account name&gt;.

When Setup seeks a service account to continue the progress, it gets the service
account name from the existing server's service logon account, which, in this
case, is set to &lt;service account name&gt; only. The domain name cannot be
retrieved. This prevents Setup from finding a proper domain controller to verify
the security identifier (SID).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the Services icon.

2. Click each Exchange Server-related service, and then change the account so
  that it is formatted as &lt;domain name&gt;\&lt;service account name&gt;.

After you have ensured that the service account names in all Exchange
Server-related services are formatted correctly, restart Setup. The new server
can now successfully join the existing site.
