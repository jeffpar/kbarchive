SYMPTOMS
========

When you start one of the Microsoft programs listed at the beginning of this
article, you may receive the following error message:

  The &lt;Filename&gt;.icd file is linked to missing export
  Dinput.dll:DirectInputCreateEx

  Mprofile.exe is linked to missing export ddraw.dll.

When you run the DirectX Diagnostic tool (Dxdiag.exe), the following message may
be displayed in the Notes box on the DirectX Files tab:

  Several files (ddraw.dll, ddraw16.dll) are old versions, which could cause
  problems. You should reinstall DirectX to get the latest version.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if Microsoft DirectX is not properly installed on your
computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue for Train Sim users, you can copy DirectX 8.0a from the
installation CD to the desktop, and install from there.

To resolve this issue in other cases, download and install the latest version of
DirectX from the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/directx/homeuser/downloads/default.asp

For additional information about how to install the latest version of DirectX,

Base:

If this issue continues to occur after you install the latest version of DirectX,

the Ddraw.dll and Ddraw16.dll files at the command prompt. To do this, click OK,
and then proceed to the "More Information" section of this article.
