The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



SYMPTOMS
========

When you send an e-mail message, the message may not be sent and may remain in
the Outbox. This behavior only occurs when you use a third-party antivirus
scanning program that uses the antivirus application programming interface (API)
that is introduced in Exchange Server Service Pack 3.

CAUSE
=====

Typically, a message is sent immediately after you send that message. This issue
can occur because when the antivirus API is enabled, the process can take longer
than expected and may cause the message to time out while it waits to be sent.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.

Knowledge Base:
