SYMPTOMS
========

When you print to a Hewlett-Packard (HP) LaserJet printer, an effect known as
"ghosting" occurs. Ghosting refers to an object or letter that is repeated
several times down the length of a page at even intervals. The repeated image
appears as a light or dark area relative to the surrounding image.

CAUSE
=====

Ghosting most often occurs when a large black pattern is followed by a fine gray
scale. The condition is caused by residual electrical charges left on the
surface of the electro-photographic (EP) drum or a lack of toner in the
developer region. Ghosting is a condition experienced in one form or another by
all devices that use the electro-photographic (EP) process. Both the developer
and the EP-drum can produce dark or light ghosting.

Both light and dark types of ghosting can be caused by either the developer or
the EP-drum. The circumference of the developer or EP-drum corresponds to the
distance between the repeated images. Therefore, measuring this distance
determines whether the EP-drum or the developer is the cause of the ghosting.

The most common form of ghosting results from a developer condition known as
developer starvation, which occurs when so much toner has been required to print
the first image that the developer does not have enough time to pick up enough
new toner and charge it sufficiently. Developer starvation produces light
ghosting.

  EP-P (92274)          25mm                    76mm

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, do the following:

1. Use a different pattern. Avoid patterns that use a 50-percent gray scale or a
  "dot-on-dot off" pattern.

2. Make changes to the layout of the page so that gray-scale patterns do not
  follow black areas. If possible, make dark patterns lighter and light
  patterns darker. Print the image in landscape.

3. Experiment with print density and resolution enhancement technology (RET)
  settings.

4. Print a completely black page immediately in front of the page that is
  experiencing the ghosting condition. This black page must be part of the same
  print job so that the printer's gear train does not pause between the pages.

5. Check humidity and temperature: Low temperature and humidity can exaggerate a
  ghosting condition. Make sure the printer's environment meets the
  requirements given in the printer's user's manual. Light or dark ghosting
  caused by the developer is HIGHLY affected by environmental conditions.

6. Print at 300 dots per inch (dpi).

7. In most cases of light ghosting, changing the toner cartridge does not
  improve the condition. Dark ghosting caused by the EP-drum may be corrected
  by replacing the toner cartridge because the EP-drum or charging roller may
  be damaged.

8. Because ghosting is mainly an issue with the EP process, switching LaserJet
  components and assemblies does not, in most cases, correct this condition.
