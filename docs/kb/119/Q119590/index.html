Product(s): Microsoft Mail For PC Networks
Version(s): 3.0,3.2

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, directory
synchronization (Dir-Sync) provides a "run window" that allows the Dir-Sync
process to begin, even though the start time has already passed. For example, it
is possible for the run window entries to be both 4 hours and 8 hours.

CAUSE
=====

The scheduling information for Dir-Sync is contained in the PROCESS.GLB file.
This file contains the time and date of the next scheduled activity for each
day. If this PROCESS.GLB file was originally created for version 3.0 of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks and modified with version 3.0 of the Mail
Administrator program (ADMIN.EXE), the run window will be 4 hours. If the
PROCESS.GLB file was later modified with version 3.2 of the ADMIN.EXE program
(after the postoffice was upgraded), the modified entries will have a run window
of 8 hours.

RESOLUTION
==========

One method to resolve this problem is to create a brand new PROCESS.GLB file by
installing a version 3.2 postoffice in a temporary location on a local hard disk
drive. First, make a backup copy of the existing PROCESS.GLB file on the
production postoffice and then copy this newly created PROCESS.GLB file to the
working postoffice. Run version 3.2 of the ADMIN.EXE program and re-create the
entries. This will set the run window to 8 hours for all of the entries.

Another method to resolve this problem is to create a brand new PROCESS.GLB file
as described above and then use the DSSCHED.EXE utility included with
Application Note WA0725, "Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync)" (text dated
8/94) to import a text file containing the schedule times. The following is a
sample text file:

  T1 Mon 22:00
  T1 Tue 22:00 T1
  Wed 22:00 T1 Thu
  22:00 T1 Fri
  22:00 T1 Sat
  22:00 T1 Sun
  22:00 T2 Mon
  01:00 T2 Tue
  01:00 T2 Wed
  01:00 T2 Thu
  01:00 T2 Fri
  01:00 T2 Sat
  01:00 T2 Sun
  01:00 T3 Mon
  03:00 T3 Tue
  03:00 T3 Wed
  03:00 T3 Thu
  03:00 T3 Fri
  03:00 T3 Sat
  03:00 T3 Sun
  03:00

Notes
-----

- The T1, T2, and T3 times are described in Application Note WA0725.

- DSSCHED.EXE will ignore the T2 times on a newly created PROCESS.GLB file
  because, by default, the postoffice installed to the temporary location is a
  requestor postoffice. To include T2, run the ADMIN.EXE program against this
  postoffice and make it a Dir-Sync server. A Dir-Sync server PROCESS.GLB file
  (including the T2 times) should not be used on a requestor postoffice.

- If all the requestor postoffices use the same Dir-Sync times and if there are
  no time-zone issues, the administrator can create one requestor PROCESS.GLB
  file and copy it to each requestor postoffice.
