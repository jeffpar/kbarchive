=======

Fine Artist and Creative Writer for Windows can open bitmaps (.BMP) or Windows
metafiles (.WMF). Fine Artist and Creative Writer for the Macintosh can open
PICT or MacPaint files.

INSTRUCTIONS
------------

To open a graphics document created in another application, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Painting (or Writing) Studio.

2. Click the Sticker Picker.

3. Click Rat Dog. This opens the Portfolio.

4. In the Portfolio, click Outside of Imaginopolis.

5. Click Go. A warning box appears, stating that it may take a few minutes to
  search the hard drive.

After following these steps, all files on the hard drive that are readable by
Fine Artist or Creative Writer appear. Select the desired file and click Go.

NOTE: To open documents on a disk, change the directory in the Portfolio prior to
clicking Outside of Imaginopolis.

To save a Fine Artist document in bitmap (.BMP) format or PICT format, follow
these steps:

1. In Windows, in the Painting Studio, press CTRL+SHIFT+A. This takes you to the
  Control Room. On the Macintosh, in the Painting Studio, press CMD+SHIFT+A.
  This takes you to the Control Room.

2. Click OK.

3. From the Fine Artist Toolbar File menu, choose Save As BMP (or PICT).

4. Name the file, and select a location for saving it.

5. Click Save.

After following these steps, the file is in a format that is readable by many
other graphics applications.
