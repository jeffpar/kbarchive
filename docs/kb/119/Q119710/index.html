-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Novice: Requires knowledge of the user interface on single-user computers.

SUMMARY
=======

To have the full functionality of the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit
(ADT), such as creating distribution disks for shipping your custom database
application, you must have a local installation of Microsoft Access version 2.0.
There is no way to work around this requirement.

This means that you cannot perform an administrative installation of Microsoft
Access to a server (with the SETUP /A command), perform workstation
installations of Microsoft Access from the server, and then install and use the
ADT on the workstations. The ADT does not work correctly with workstation
installations of Microsoft Access; a local installation of Microsoft Access is
required.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This requirement is the first item listed in the "Errata and Omissions in
Advanced Topics" section of the README.TXT file that is shipped with the ADT.

Although there are methods of working around this requirement, these methods are
not recommended because they create more problems than they solve. One reason
for this is that the ADT Setup Wizard is written to look for specific files in
specific locations, and a local installation of Microsoft Access puts the proper
files in the proper places.

The ADT will work with a Typical, Custom/Complete, or Laptop local installation
of Microsoft Access. Which local installation option you choose should be
determined by your development environment and which tools you need for
developing your application. For example, if you are using ISAM drivers in your
database application, you should choose the Complete installation option when
you install Microsoft Access.
