-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- The Visual Workbench Integrated Debugger, used with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++, versions 1.0, 1.5 
   - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a header file (also known as an include file) does not exist, the way it
appears in the source file determines whether it is included as a dependency.
The file is included if it has a "\" or a "/" in its file specification.
Additionally there is no warning that the file does not exist when a dependency
scan is done.

RESOLUTION
==========

Adding the filename to the SYSINCL.DAT file (if you are using Visual C++ for
Windows, versions 1.0 and 1.5) or to the MSVCINCL.DAT file (if you are using
Visual C++ for Windows NT, version 1.0) then restarting Visual C++ prevents the
file from being included in the project. SYSINCL.DAT resides in the \MSVC\BIN
directory. MSVCINCL.DAT can be found in the Windows or Windows NT directory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the products listed at the beginning
of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual C++ version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following TEST.H files are included as a dependency in the project's
makefile.

Sample Code
-----------

     #include ".\test.h"
     #include "abc$def/test.h"

Additional query words: 1.00 1.50 1.10
