Product(s): Microsoft Mail For Appletalk Networks
Version(s): WINDOWS:3.0,3.1
Operating System(s): 
Keyword(s): 
Last Modified: 10-NOV-1999

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using version 3.x of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks Backup Utility
to backup the Microsoft Mail Data File, the following error may be presented
when the machine reboots:

  The last time you started up, the INIT named "AppleShareX" crashed the
  startup process. For your convenience, it has been turned off, but be aware
  that any INIT that loaded before it could also have caused the problem."

This error will remain on the screen until the OK button is clicked; thus, it
will keep the Mail Server from loading.

CAUSE
=====

The above error can be received if the Macintosh that is running MS Mail Backup
also has Now Utilities' Startup Manager installed. Startup Manager has a feature
to disable crashing extensions, which presents the above error when certain
events occur.

RESOLUTION
==========

In order to keep the above error message from appearing, Startup Manager's
disable crashing extensions feature must be disabled. To do so:

1. Open the Startup Manager control panel.

2. Click the Prefs button.

3. Deselect the "Disable Crashing Extensions" checkbox.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MS Mail Backup Utility is not crashing the system. The AppleShareX file is
used to keep Mail related software from loading while the backup occurs. Startup
Manager flags the disabling of this software by AppleShareX as a crashing
problem and presents the error. To use MS Mail Backup with Startup Manager, this
feature must be disabled.
