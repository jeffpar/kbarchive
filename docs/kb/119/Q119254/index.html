The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Mail for Windows includes a utility called CONVERT.EXE that converts
Microsoft Mail MS-DOS client folders and Microsoft Mail for Windows version 2.1
folders so that they can be used with versions 3.0 and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for
Windows. Microsoft Mail version 2.1 stores private folders in .FLD files. These
.FLD files are indexed with the .IDX file. These folders can be stored on the
server or locally. When the folders are stored locally, the user's .IDX file and
.FLD files are moved to the path specified by the user.

MORE INFORMATION
================

CONVERT.EXE is a Windows utility that reads the .IDX file and then copies the
information from the .FLD files into your .MMF file. When the CONVERT utility is
finished copying the information, the following dialog box will appear:

  Convert has successfully transferred your old messages to the new format. If
  you do not need the old messages, you may delete them at this time. Do you
  want to keep the old messages?

You can choose YES to keep the .IDX file and .FLD files or choose NO to reset the
.IDX file back to 100 bytes and delete the .FLD files. If the folders were
stored on the server, the .FLD files will be deleted successfully. However, if
the folders were stored locally, the IDX file will be reset but the .FLD files
will not be deleted. The .FLD files will no longer be accessible via the MS-DOS
Mail client but they will still exist in the directory where they were stored
locally. Therefore, you will need to delete the .FLD files located on the local
workstation.
