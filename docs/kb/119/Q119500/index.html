-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Workbench for Windows, version 1.0, used with:
   - *EDITOR Please do not choose this product*Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit Edition* use 241, 265, 225, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When building a project with a makefile created by the Visual Workbench, if you
attempt to specify the output filename (.EXE or .DLL) by selecting the Options
menu, and choosing Project, Linker, Output, or specifying the /OUT switch by
selecting the Options menu and choosing Project, Linker, Miscellaneous, Other
Options, the target name remains unchanged. The target is named according to the
base name of the makefile being used.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around the problem, add a line similar to the following ( without
brackets ):

  REN &lt;makefile base name&gt;.&lt;EXE or DLL&gt; &lt;new target base
  name&gt;.&lt;EXE or DLL&gt;

to the Visual Workbench-generated makefile, immediately following the LINK
command line in the inference rule that causes LINK to be executed. The
resulting makefile can be used with NMAKE from the command line, as well as by
the Visual Workbench. The caveat here is that when using the (modified) makefile
in the Visual Workbench, the makefile must be opened as an external makefile, so
that the inference rules will be used when NMAKE is spawned. When an "internal"
makefile is used, the inference rules in the Visual Workbench-generated makefile
are not used, rather, the Visual Workbench manages the build process much like
NMAKE would, without actually spawning NMAKE. Using the modified makefile as an
"internal" makefile will not give an error, but the target file will not be
renamed. The only way to ensure that the target will properly be renamed is to
use the modified "internal" makefile as an external makefile.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the products listed at the beginning
of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual C++ version 2.0.
