-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to play any game on the Zone (for example, Internet Backgammon),
you may receive the following error message:

  Error: Cannot launch game. A Web page error is preventing the game from
  opening. Try refreshing the page, or try again later.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may occur if an antivirus program or firewall program, such as
Norton Antivirus or Norton Internet Security, is installed and running on your
computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, quit all antivirus and firewall programs before you try
to play games on the Zone. For more information about your antivirus or firewall
program, use the program's Help feature, see the program's manual, or contact
the manufacturer.

NOTE: When you quit these programs, the antivirus or firewall protection that
these programs provide becomes unavailable. To restore the protection, restart
these programs when you finish playing games on the Zone.
