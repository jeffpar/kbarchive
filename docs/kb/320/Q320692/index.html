-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0 SP3, 2.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The transaction history file that is located in a site's
SMS\Inboxes\Replmgr.box\History folder may become very large, and may continue
to grow.

CAUSE
=====

This problem was introduced with Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Service
Pack 3 (SP3). SMS Replication Manager incorrectly inserts the file path and
unique file name that is associated with incoming site system status summarizer,
component status summarizer, and advertisement status summarizer files, and
inserts their associated transaction IDs.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services

additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

MORE INFORMATION
================

How to Install the Hotfix
-------------------------

Apply this fix on all of the sites in the SMS hierarchy. To install the fix, use
one of the following methods.

How to Use the Hotfix Installer:

NOTE: You can use this method only on I386-based computers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a local folder on your site server or to
  a share on your network. The I386 and Alpha subfolders are required; you must
  also download them from the Microsoft FTP site. It is important to keep the
  folder structure intact. The Q3320692.exe file is a Microsoft Windows
  Installer file that updates specific files on your site server.

2. Log on to your site server by using an account with administrator
  permissions.

3. On the site server, quit the SMS Administrator console.

4. Run the Q320692.exe file and follow the instructions in the wizard. The
  Systems Management Server services are stopped and restarted as part of the
  installation process.

How to Manually Install the Hotfix:

1. Copy the update program file (Q320692.exe) and platform folders to a new
  folder. The folder structure must be arranged so that the program file is
  located one folder "above" the platform folders.

2. Quit the SMS Administrator console and stop all SMS services in Control
  Panel. If the SMS_SITE_BACKUP service is running, stop it also.

3. Replace the Basesvr.dll file in the SMS\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the
  version in the hotfix &lt;Platform&gt; folder.

4. Replace the Baseutil.dll file in the SMS\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the
  version in the hotfix &lt;Platform&gt; folder.

5. Replace the Cmprov.dll file in the SMS\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the
  version in the hotfix &lt;Platform&gt; folder.

6. Replace the Colleval.dll file in the SMS\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the
  version in the hotfix &lt;Platform&gt; folder.

7. Replace the COMPMGR.EXE file in the SMS\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the
  version in the hotfix &lt;Platform&gt; folder.

8. Locate the Update.sql file in the I386 hotfix folder. In a SQL server tool
  such as ISQLW (SQL Query Analyzer), connect to the SMS database and verify
  that the DB box shows the correct SMS database name. This is typically
  SMS_&lt;sitecode&gt; (where &lt;sitecode&gt; is the three-digit site code for
  that site). Load the Update.sql script into ISQLW, and then run the script.
  If the script runs correctly, the Results pane shows a "The command(s)
  completed successfully" message.

9. Examine the transaction history (.trs) files for the site in the
  SMS\Inboxes\Replmgr.box\History folder. Open each file in Notepad and then
  locate the [SMS_SITE_SYSTEM_STATUS_SUMMARIZER],
  [SMS_COMPONENT_STATUS_SUMMARIZER], and [SMS_OFFER_STATUS_SUMMARIZER]
  sections. In each of these sections, remove all references to
  X:\SMS\Inboxes\&lt;Summarizername&gt;.BOX\REPL\&lt;Uniquefilename&gt;.SUM=&lt;TransactionIDNumber&gt;.
  Save the .trs file.

10. Restart the SMS site services.
