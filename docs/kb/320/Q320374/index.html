The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.1 
- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A cross-site scripting (CSS) vulnerability exists in Internet Information
Services (IIS) 5.0 and 5.1. Through this vulnerability, it could be possible for
an attacker to send a request to an affected server that would cause a Web page
that contains script to be sent to another user. The script would execute within
the user's browser as though it had come from the third-party site. This would
let it run by using the security settings that are appropriate to the
third-party Web site, and provide the attacker with access to any data that the
site owns.

This vulnerability could only be exploited if the user opened an HTML mail
message or visited a malicious user's Web site. The code cannot be "injected"
into an existing session.

CAUSE
=====

This vulnerability occurs because a customized message service in IIS does not
properly validate all inputs before they are used. The customized message is
what is returned when someone requests a Web page that does not exist on the
server.

Note that the default error message in IIS is unaffected by this vulnerability.

RESOLUTION
