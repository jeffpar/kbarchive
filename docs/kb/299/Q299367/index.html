-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Network Information Service (NIS) servers may not authenticate UNIX users with
their group permissions.

CAUSE
=====

When a UNIX user is added to a UNIX group by using Active Directory, the NIS
server updates the group.byname and group.byuid files in its MapCache folder to
be the same. These files are used for group authentication. When NIS updates
these files, it uses the user's CN name rather than the MsSFUName attribute.
This can result in an invalid user ID being added to the group files if these
are different.

For example, a user with a CN name of "First Last" and a logon name of "firstlas"
would have the invalid "First Last" name added to the group files.

this will put the correct name in the group files.
