SUMMARY
=======

To prevent words from being incorrectly identified as "misspelled" by the
spelling checker in MSN Explorer, you can add words to the spelling checker
dictionary. Examples of these types of words include the following:

- Your last name

- A name of a company you frequently write about in e-mail

- Any word that the dictionary in your spelling checker wouldn't normally
  recognize

But though you may wish to remove or modify words in the dictionary of your
spelling checker, you may not know how to do so.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You cannot edit the spelling checker dictionary through MSN Explorer; you must
add words by editing the msnspell.dic file on your computer. In addition, the
words you add to the MSN Explorer dictionary through the msnspell.dic file are
not shared across other programs on your computer (Microsoft Office, Microsoft
Works). So, for example, when you add words to the dictionary in Microsoft Word,
the words will not be automatically added to your MSN Explorer dictionary.
Finally, because MSN Explorer creates a custom dictionary specifically for your
user account, words added to your custom dictionary are not added to the
dictionaries of others who may have user tiles on the same computer.

The msnspell.dic file is a text file, so you can open and modify this file using
Notepad or other text editors.

To find msnspell.dic, you must first configure your computer to display hidden
files.

To view hidden files

1. Right-click Start, and then click Explore.

2. On the toolbar, click Tools, and then click Folder Options.

3. Click the View tab, and then under Advanced Settings list, select Show hidden
  or system files, and then click OK.

4. Quit Windows Explorer.

Next, you must search for and find msnspell.dic.

To find msnspell.dic

1. Click Start, point to Search, and then click Find Files or Folders.

2. In the Named box, type hotmail.ini, and in the Containing Text box, type your
  e-mail address.

3. In the Look in box, make sure that your hard drive (usually C:) is selected,
  and then select the Include subfolders box.

4. Click Find.
  Note: If you have more than one hotmail.ini file listed in the folder, select
  the most recently modified file.

5. In the top menu, click File, and then click Open Containing Folder.

6. Double click msnspell.dic.

7. Modify the file as needed.

After you have finished editing the msnspell.dic file, do the following to turn
off the option to view hidden and system files.

To turn off the option to view hidden and system files

1. Right-click Start, and then click Explore.

2. Click Tools, and then click Folder Options.

3. Click the View tab, and then under Advanced Settings list, select Do not show
  hidden or system files, and then click OK.

4. Quit Windows Explorer.
