The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure a Systems Management Server (SMS) site with site-wide
Traveling mode set to "always on", Windows NT Remote Client Installation does
not work and the following message is logged in the Ccm.log file if logging is
enabled:

  ---&gt; Travel mode is turned ON &amp; the client is NOT currently assigned
  to this site. Discarding CCR

CAUSE
=====

The following scenario causes Client Configuration Requests (CCRs) to be
abandoned, therefore preventing Windows NT Remote Client Installation:

- The SMS site is configured to have Traveling mode always enabled. This is
  where the Traveling mode switch is set to 1. For more information, view the
  More Information section in this article.

- The SMS client is attempting to install on a Windows NT-based computer where
  the logged on user is not an administrator (low rights user).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q288239 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack




STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following article describes SMS Traveling mode and the SMS Support tools,
Chktravl.bat and Clitravl.exe:

  Q199114 How to Configure Traveling Mode on Client Computers

Traveling Mode is an SMS client registry setting that dictates the SMS client
behavior for mobile clients when they enter the boundary of a site to which they
are not currently assigned. Traveling mode is discussed in the Traveling Mode
section in chapter 9 of the Microsoft Systems Management Server Administrator's
guide. There are three ways to modify Traveling mode, each with increasing
levels of granularity:

1. Using the Systems Management Control Panel plug-in.

2. Using modification of the SMS client registry with the CliTravl utility which
  affects a single client at a time.

3. Using modification of the site's Site Control file (Sitectrl.ct0) which
  affects all clients in the site.

When you use the third option to set the Traveling mode switch to 1
(TRAVELMODE_ALWAYS_ON), any Windows NT client that produces a CCR has that CCR
discarded by the Client Configuration Manager (CCM). The hotfix modifies the CCM
design to allow CCRs from new clients (that currently have no SMS client
components installed), to have the SMS client remotely installed. Other
Traveling mode site settings are not affected.
