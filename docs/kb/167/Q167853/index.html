The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual C++, Macintosh Cross-Development Addon, versions 4.0, 4.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you build a MFC application for the Power Macintosh, the following error
message appears:

  LNK1104 Cannot Find mfc42pd.lib (debug)

-or-

  LNK1104 Cannot Find mfc42p.lib (release)

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when you are compiling a Visual C++ Mac MFC application. The
headers from MFC 4.2 are being pulled in instead of the headers from MFC 4.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

Run the "Visual C++ Cross Development Setup" application found in the "Microsoft
Visual C++ 4.0" program group. If the application does not exist in the program
group, launch the executable Setupmfc.exe. Setupmfc.exe can be found in the
\msdev\bin directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Visual C++ Mac is not a subscription-based product. Visual C++ (x86) is
subscription based though. The last release of Visual C++ Mac was Visual C++ Mac
4.0, which worked with Visual C++ 4.0 and MFC 4.0. There was an update for
Visual C++ Mac (4.0b) that included new libraries and code fragments for Windows
Portability Library. It did not contain any new MFC features.

Therefore, Visual C++ Mac 4.0 and 4.0b are supposed to work with MFC 4.0. When a
newer version of Visual C++ is installed (4.1 or 4.2), and Visual C++ Mac is
installed, the settings for MSDEV have to be changed using Setupmfc.exe.

Setupmfc.exe changes the settings for MSDEV and also some registry settings. It
creates the directory \msdev\Mfc40 with 'include' and 'src' directories that
contain the include and src files from the Visual C++ 4.0 MFC directory. Then,
it modifies the registry so that the header and source file settings for the
Power Mac and 68k Mac targets (found on the Directories tab under Options on the
Tools menu) point to those new directories.

It is a common mistake to insert the VC Mac 4.0 CD or VC++ 4.2 (x86) when running
Setupmfc.exe. Please remember to insert the original VC 4.0 (x86) CD.

In some rare cases, it may be necessary to use the windows headers from Visual
C++ 4.0 as well. This has to be done manually by copying the \msdev\include
directory from Visual C++ 4.0 to your \msdev and renaming it (for example,
include40). Then make the appropriate changes on the Directories tab under
Options on the Tools menu as well for the PowerMac or 68k Mac targets.

The reference to mfc42pd.lib and mfc42p.lib is found in \msdev\mfc\include\afx.h.
These two files do not exist.
