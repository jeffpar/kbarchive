SYMPTOMS
========

If you select all of the text in a paragraph, excluding the paragraph mark, and
change the font formatting of the text, the formatting changes are applied to
the paragraph mark also. This affects any subsequent paragraphs when you press
ENTER from any point within this paragraph. This functionality is different from
earlier versions of Word.

NOTE: To see the paragraph mark and other nonprinting characters, click the
Show/Hide button on the Standard toolbar.

CAUSE
=====

When you apply font formatting to a selection of text that spans a paragraph,
Word assumes you want to change the paragraph formatting even though you did not
select the paragraph mark.

WORKAROUND
==========

To format all of the text within a paragraph without affecting the paragraph
formatting (excluding the paragraph mark), select all but one character of the
paragraph and then apply the font formatting. Select the remaining character and
apply the same font formatting.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In earlier versions of Word, if you want to apply character formatting to the
paragraph mark, you must select it before you apply the font formatting;
otherwise, the paragraph mark does not take on the new character formatting.

In Word 97, if all of the text in the paragraph is selected (excluding the
paragraph mark), character formatting changes are applied not only to the text
of the paragraph but also to the paragraph mark.

Selecting white space before or after the text has no effect on this behavior.
