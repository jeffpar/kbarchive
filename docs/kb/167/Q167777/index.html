- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

Included with Service Pack 2 for Systems Management Server 1.2 is new
functionality that allows a Systems Management Server client's inventory to be
"moved" in a multiple site hierarchy.

With all prior versions of Systems Management Server, a client's inventory would
not be automatically deleted from an old site's database if the client started
reporting to a new one. The administrator would have had to delete the old
client record manually, by using the Systems Management Server Administrator
program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following steps describe what is involved when a client starts reporting to
a new site/domain combination:

1. When a Systems Management Server client detects a site or domain change, the
  client inventory agent updates the Sms.ini file with the new values and sends
  up a full resynchronization (resync) inventory to the new Systems Management
  Server logon server.

2. The Dataloader service at the new site compares the client's inventory to the
  record (if any) in the database to see if the client's site code has changed.
  If there is no existing client inventory record, the .mif file is processed
  normally and no further action is taken by the Dataloader service.

3. If the site code for the client is different, the Dataloader computes the
  site that would be the lowest in the hierarchy, yet still able to tell the
  old-site from the new-site. This computed site is called the cross-site, and
  is the only site from which the actual movement is "commanded." The
  cross-site is important because it prevents more than one site from sending
  delete MIFs.

4. If the current site is the cross-site, the tree of sites immediately below
  the cross-site that the client used to report to is computed and each one
  added to an "old-site" list.

5. The client inventory .mif file that initiated all of this is processed
  normally and then passed up to the parent site (if any). Any sites above the
  cross-site evaluate the .mif file in the same fashion, but will not take any
  further action, because they determine themselves not to be the cross-site.

6. For each primary site in the old-site list, a small delete MIF is created for
  this particular client, which is then handed to the site reporter service
  running on the cross-site.

7. The site reporter creates one or more mini-jobs (system jobs) to send these
  delete MIFs to the specific target primary sites.

8. The losing-sites receives the delete MIF and processes a simple delete just
  as if it came from the Systems Management Server Administrator program. This
  action also revokes the Systems Management Server client license from the
  License Manager as well.

Administrators should still use the Systems Management Server Database Manager
(Dbclean.exe) to purge Unused Common/Specific Records and old history. The small
delete MIF mentioned above only does a simple task in the database of moving the
deleted client into history.

The log file created by the Dataloader service, Datalodr.log, contains specific
entries for this new functionality to show what the service is doing.
