SUMMARY
=======

When you include components, such as the Active Template Library or the DAO SDK,
the ClassView of the Project Workspace displays each class found in these
components as part of your project. For larger components, the number of classes
displayed can swamp the classes you have created for your project.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To prevent classes from being displayed in the ClassView pane, you need to
remove the header with the class declarations from the project's dependency
list. To do this, follow these steps:

1. If the include file is in the same directory as your project, you need to
  move it to a different location.

  a. Create a directory where you want to relocate the header file(s) that you
     want to remove from the dependency list. For example:

     mkdir c:\msdev\projects\myproj\inc

  b. Move the header files to this new directory.

  c. Add this directory to your include search path by using the Directories
     tab in the Options dialog box (click Options on the Tools menu.

2. Create a text file named Msvcincl.dat, and list the header files you want to
  exclude from the dependencies list. Save this file to your Windows directory.
  An example is shown below for both the DAO SDK and the Active Template
  Library.

     dbdao.h
     atlcom.h
     atlbase.h

3. Close Developer Studio, and delete the project's .ncb file.

4. Restart Developer Studio, and load your project. The classes declared in the
  headers listed in the Msvcincl.dat file should no longer appear in the
  ClassView pane.

NOTE: The Msvcincl.dat file must be located in your Windows directory, and your
#include directives must not specify a full pathname to these headers.
Otherwise, these files will remain in the project's dependencies list.
