SUMMARY
=======

As discussed in the Microsoft Windows NT Workstation Deployment Guide,
Unattend.txt and Sysdiff.exe cannot be used to preinstall sound cards and
hardware devices. These devices must be installed after installation has been
completed. To install devices during setup, the commands must be placed in the
Cmdlines.txt file.

However, by using the runonce key in the registry, you may set up various Control
Panel tools so that they will start after the first time a workstation has
logged on so that the administrator may add sound cards and tape drives. You can
also place the entries in the Cmdlines.txt file so that the desired Control
Panel tools will start during the installation of Windows NT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For detailed instructions on using the Runonce option, consult the Microsoft
Windows NT 4.0 Deployment Guide, Chapter 5, and refer to the section on
"Executing a Batch File on First Logon to Customize Windows NT." The Deployment
Guide may be viewed from the following Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/ntworkstation/technicalresources/deployment/DeploymentDocs/DownGuideAutomate.asp.

To have the Multimedia tool under Control Panel automatically start when logging
on, place the following line in the runonce key:

     "Multimedia"="rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL mmsys.cpl,@0"

NOTE: Multimedia is the value name, the data type is REG_SZ and the value is
rundll32.exe and so on. The syntax is the same for each of the following lines.

To have the Multimedia tool start up when logging on, place the following line in
the runonce key:

     "Soundcard"="rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL mmsys.cpl,@0,4"

To have the SCSI tool start up when logging on, place the following line in the
runonce key:

     "SCSI"="rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL devapps.cpl,@1"

To have the Tape tool start up when logging on, place the following line in
runonce:

     "Tape"="rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL devapps.cpl,@2"

To have the Server tool start up when logging on, place the following line in
runonce:

     "Server"="rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL srvmgr.cpl,@0"

To have the Services tool start up when logging on, place the following line in
runonce:

     "Services"="rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL srvmgr.cpl,@1"

To have the Devices tool start up when logging on, place the following line in
runonce:

     "Devices"="rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL srvmgr.cpl,@2"

The above examples are not a complete list of all Control Panel tools that may be
automatically started. Notice that SCSI and Tape share a common .cpl file,
devapps.cpl, but have different ending parameters.

To test other .cpl files (including third party), you can copy and paste the
Rundll32.exe segment from the above lines to the Start \ Run command line. For
example, the following line will bring up the Add/Remove tool:

     "rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL Appwiz.cpl,@0,1"

Changing the last number from one to two will open the Add/Remove tool with the
Windows NT Setup tab selected.

To keep the unattended setup unattended, you can add these lines to a batch file
or other script added to the runonce key, as well as a macro or other script.
