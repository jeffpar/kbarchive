-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following new features and enhancements have been made in Microsoft Windows
NT version 4.0 Service Pack 2:

- DLL Surrogates

- IAccessControl/CoInitializeSecurity

- Using RPC with WinSock Proxy

DLL Surrogates
--------------

Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2 now provides the functionality to incorporate DLL
servers that can be loaded into surrogate EXE processes. This combines the ease
of writing DLL servers with the benefits of executable implementation. COM
provides default surrogate processes, or you can write a custom surrogate if you
have special needs. The DLL server, in a surrogate process, offers the benefit
of:

- Fault isolation and the ability to service multiple clients simultaneously.

- In a distributed environment, a DLL server implementation could be used to
  service remote clients.

- It could permit clients to protect themselves from untrusted server code,
  while allowing access to the services the DLL server provides.

- Running a DLL server in a surrogate provides the DLL with the surrogate's
  security.

IAccessControl/CoInitializeSecurity
-----------------------------------

IAccessControl and CoInitializeSecurity are two new features written into Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 2. IAccessControl is an interface to control access to
objects and their properties. The methods used by the IAccessControl interface
help you manage access to objects and their properties and to get information
about access permissions.

CoInitializeSecurity registers security and sets the default security values. For
legacy applications, COM automatically calls CoInitializeSecurity with values
from the registry. You can use CoInitializeSecurity in conjunction with
IAccessControl. The CoInitializeSecurity function takes the pointer to
IAccessControl.

Using RPC With WinSock Proxy
----------------------------

Another new feature is the recent release of Microsoft(r) Internet Access Server
that includes WinSock Proxy, an enhanced version of Windows Sockets API, version
1.1.

WinSock Proxy lets a Windows Sockets application, running on a private network
client, behave as if it were directly connected to a remote Internet server
application. Actually, the Microsoft Proxy Server is the host for this
connection. This means that all application-level communications are channeled
through a single secured computer; the gateway computer running Microsoft Proxy
Server.

To use RPC with WinSock Proxy, you need to edit the system registry on each
computer.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE window, go to the following key:

  Software\Microsoft\Rpc

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value.

4. Add the following:

     Value Name : UseWinsockForIP
     Data Type  : REG_DWORD
     Data       : 1

5. Click OK.

6. Quit Registry Editor.
