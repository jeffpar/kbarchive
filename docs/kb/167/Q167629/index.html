- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition

SYMPTOMS
========

An attacker can send a query to a DNS server asking for the IP address (for
example, of www.microsoft.com.) The DNS server sends a recursive query on behalf
of the client at which point the attacker floods the DNS server with responses
indicating the IP address (for example, for www.microsoft.com it may return
127.0.0.1,) or any other incorrect response as desired by the attacker. The DNS
server caches this result and subsequent queries for this site return the
incorrect IP address. The cached entry can be set to live for an arbitrarily
long time in the cache and is not purged until the DNS server is reset.

CAUSE
=====

The Domain Name System (DNS) is used to resolve names with IP addresses and a
DNS query can be sent to any DNS server. If the server does not have the
authoritative answer to the query, it can ask other DNS servers in the DNS tree
for the answer. This is called a recursive query. The result of a recursive
query is cached by the originating DNS server to improve performance. A DNS
server may have many outstanding recursive queries at any one moment in time and
each outstanding query is identified by a query ID.

Microsoft Windows NT (and many other) DNS servers use a predictable sequence of
query IDs when resolving recursive queries. If an attacker can determine the
current sequence number, they can determine future sequence numbers. Knowledge
of future sequence numbers helps an attacker flood a DNS server with spoofed
responses to recursive queries. This makes a "cache pollution" attack easier to
accomplish.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Microsoft DNS Server has been modified to use random query IDs. Random query
IDs reduce the effectiveness of this cache pollution attack.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


For your convenience, the English version of this post-SP3 hotfix has been posted
to the following Internet location. However, Microsoft recommends that you
install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 to correct this problem.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this problem could result in some degree of security
vulnerability in Windows NT version 4.0. This problem was first corrected in
Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server
Edition Service Pack 4.
