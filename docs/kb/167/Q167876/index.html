SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Visual Basic for Applications Documents collection to return
all currently open documents, the document names returned to your procedure may
produce duplicate names and the collection returned is incorrect.

For example, if the following three documents are currently open in Word,

  Doc1.doc
  Doc2.doc
  Doc3.doc

and you close Doc1.doc and then run your procedure to return the collection, the
following series of files is returned, even though Doc3.doc is still open.

  Doc2.doc
  Doc2.doc

Use the Windows collection in a Visual Basic for Applications macro to work
around this problem. For example:

     Sub DocCollection()
        Dim wDoc As Window
        ' Loop through all Windows currently open.
        For Each wDoc In Windows
           ' Display name of document open in the current window.
           MsgBox wDoc.Document.name
        Next
     End Sub

If you have several windows, which contain the same document, open at the same
time, modify the code to check for duplicate document window names. For
example:

    Sub DocCollection()
        Dim wDoc As Window
        Dim sCap As String
        ' Loop through all Windows currently open.
        For Each wDoc In Windows
           ' Get the Window caption.
           sCap = wDoc.Caption
           ' If the document open in the current window
           ' is a duplicate window (signified by the
           ' document name followed by a colon and
           ' the window number in the Caption property).
           If InStr(1, sCap, ":") &gt; 0 Then
              ' and if the number equals 1 (first copy of document).
              If Mid$(sCap, InStr(1, sCap, ":") + 1, 1) = "1" Then
                 ' Return the document name.
                 MsgBox wDoc.Document.Name
              End If
           ' If the window caption does not contain a colon,
           ' return the window's document name.
           Else
              MsgBox wDoc.Document.Name
           End If
        Next
     End Sub
