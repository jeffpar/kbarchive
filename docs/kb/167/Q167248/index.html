SUMMARY
=======

If a primary domain controller (PDC) is unavailable or needs to be taken
offline, a backup domain controller (BDC) can be promoted in its place. This
should only be done when the PDC is expected to be down for a long period of
time because the automatic demotion of the original PDC to BDC will not occur.
In many circumstances, it is fine to be without a PDC for a short time. However,
if User Manager is needed, or if a user needs to change his or her password,
there must be a PDC present.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Promote BDC to PDC
------------------

With the primary domain controller offline or gracefully shut down and turned
off, in Server Manager, promote one of the backup domain controllers. Because
the primary domain controller is offline, you will receive the following
warning:

  Server Manager cannot find the Primary Domain Controller for
  &lt;DomainName&gt;. You may administer the domain, but certain domain-wide
  operations will be disabled.

The second PDC to be started may report the following errors in the Event log:

  Event 3097 Source Netlogon A primary domain controller is already running in
  this domain.

  Event 7024 Source Service Control Manager The Net Logon service terminated
  with service-specific error 3097.

To see a list of the backup domain controllers in your domain, verify that the
check box is cleared next to the entry "Show Domain Members only" under the View
menu. With this check box cleared, the list presented in Server Manager is
provided by the browser service. When the check box is selected, the PDC's user
account database (SAM) is queried for all Windows NT-based workstations,
servers, and domain controllers that have a computer account in that domain. The
following key in the registry is parsed:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SAM\SAM\Domains\Account\Users\Names\&lt;ComputerName$&gt;

Select the backup domain controller you want to promote, and under the View menu,
select Promote to Primary Domain Controller.

Demote PDC to BDC
-----------------

Whenever domain administration tools are used, the changes or additions occur at
the PDC. When domain synchronization occurs, these changes or deltas are sent
from the PDC to the BDC using this one-way replication.

Because a "stand-in" PDC was necessary while the "original" PDC was offline,
changes have probably been made to the database on the stand-in computer; it
will be important for it to remain the PDC while the original PDC is demoted.
Successfully demoting the original PDC will also cause a synchronization with
the stand-in PDC, giving it the recent changes done during its absence. Later,
the original PDC can once again resume the role of PDC for the domain by simply
promoting it in Server Manager.

To demote the original PDC just brought back online, use Server Manager. Under
the View menu, clear the check box next to "Show domain members only." This
allows a browse list to inform Server Manager that the computer is configured as
a PDC, and will allow it to be demoted. Select the original PDC, and select
"Demote to backup domain controller" under the Computer menu.

The following is further explanation of the browser information in Server
Manager:

Check mark next to "Show domain Members Only" (no browser information):

  COMPUTER                              TYPE

  PDC icon (available)     Stand-In       Windows NT Primary
  BDC icon (dimmed)        Original       Windows NT Backup

No check mark next to "Show domain Members Only" (with browser information):

  COMPUTER                              TYPE

  PDC icon (available)     Stand-In       Windows NT &lt;version&gt; Primary
  PDC icon (dimmed)        Original       Windows NT &lt;version&gt; Primary

With the browser information, Server Manager allows the original PDC to be
selected and demoted by choosing "Demote to Backup Domain Controller." Without
the browser information, Server Manager is just looking at the current PDC's
registry, and there is no option to demote the PDC. It is considered a backup
because the registry does not contain the role of all other domain controllers
in the domain. Only its own role is maintained.

The icon and type conventions in Server Manager when browsing information is
introduced are altered when two PDCs are in one domain.

With no browser information, all of the icons are dimmed except for the PDC,
because that is the only computer Server Manager knows is up and running. Also
note that the original PDC has the icon of a BDC, and the Type is Backup. With
no other information other than the SAM on the PDC, all other domain controllers
are BDCs in a usual environment.

When browser information is integrated into the domain list in Server Manager,
the icons can be available because there is a mechanism to determine if the
computers are currently running in the domain. In addition, Windows NT version
information can be included. Also, Windows for Workgroups computers that have
their workgroup name set to that of the domain name will appear in the list.
Notice that the original PDC's icon is dimmed and the Type has changed from
Backup to Primary. This is because having more than one PDC in a domain violates
domain rules, and now the browser information is parsed, and the intended role
of the computer can be determined.

Two PDCs Active at the Same Time
--------------------------------

It may be possible for more than one PDC to be active in a domain at the same
time. This may cause serious problems, but can be the result of several things.
If a network connection such as a router or cable fails, and during this failure
a BDC was promoted, when the failure is resolved, two PDCs will be active in the
domain. Because both are already running, the Netlogon service does not have the
chance of detecting another PDC at startup time and fails to start. Some other
reasons for having more than one PDC active would be because there is a very
slow WAN link, the WINS databases are out of sync, not configured as push or
pull partners, or replicating too slowly.

When there are two PDCs active at the same time, when it comes time to resolving
the situation, a decision must be made as to which changes that potentially were
made to each User Account database using the Administrator tools must be lost.
Because domain synchronization is a one- way replication from the PDC to BDC,
there is no merging or time-stamp method for resolving the differences.

In addition to running User Manager on each PDC to determine what accounts it
has, you can type NET USER at the command prompt.

You can choose whichever PDC to demote by having its Netlogon service "collide"
with the other PDC's Netlogon service. The first computer to successfully start
the Netlogon service and browser service, will remain the PDC. The second PDC
that starts and has its Netlogon service fail to start can be demoted.

Use NET ACCOUNTS to Verify Domain Controller Role
-------------------------------------------------

At a command prompt, Cmd.exe, enter the following to determine the current role
of a domain controller:

  &lt;DriveLetter&gt;\NET ACCOUNTS

Below is a sample of the output:

  c:\&gt;NET ACCOUNTS
  Force user logoff how long after time expires?:       Never
  Minimum password age (days):                          0
  Maximum password age (days):                          42
  Minimum password length:                              0
  Length of password history maintained:                None
  Lockout threshold:                                    Never
  Lockout duration (minutes):                           30
  Lockout observation window (minutes):                 30
  Computer role:                                        PRIMARY
  The command completed successfully.

The last line indicates the present role of the Domain Controller.


Two PDCs Active at the Same Time
--------------------------------

If two PDCs are active at the same time, you may receive event ID 5512:

  Component:NET
  Event ID:5512Log: System
  Source:NetLogonType: Error

Explanation: Each domain should have only one PDC. Two PDCs exist in the domain
because one of the PDCs stopped working for an extended period. A backup domain
controller (BDC) was then promoted to PDC. Now the original PDC is working
again.
