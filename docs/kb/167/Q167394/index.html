SYMPTOMS
========

During the setup of Remote Access Service (RAS) on a Windows NT 4.0 server
computer, a serial modem is installed and configured. When the server is
restarted, the modem is detected as Microsoft Serial Mouse and the modem is no
longer usable by RAS.

CAUSE
=====

During startup of Windows NT, the NTDETECT program gathers information about the
hardware installed on the system including pointing devices such as serial mice.
If a mouse is detected, the system designates that port as a mouse port and does
not allow it to be used for other purposes, such as a modem. Data is sent to the
serial ports and the response from the modem is interpreted as the presence of a
mouse. The system will attempt to load serial mouse software for that com port
and prevent the use of the port for serial modems.

RESOLUTION
==========

Edit the boot.ini file and add to the end of the "Operating Systems" lines one
of the following;

  /NoSerialMice (This disables detection of Serial Mice on all COM ports

-or-

  /NoSerialMice:COMx (This disables detection of Serial Mice on only the
  COM port specified by x)
