- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Windows NT version 4.0 Service Pack 2 to a computer with a Micro
Channel Architecture (MCA) network adapter, you may receive the following error
message:

  At least one service or driver failed during system startup. Use Event Viewer
  to examine the event log for details.

When you look at the event log, you see the following entry:

  Event ID: 7000
  Source: Service Control Manager
  Description: A device connected to the system is not functioning.

After you log on to the computer, you may have no network access through the MCA
network adapter.

CAUSE
=====

The Ndis.sys device driver in Service Pack 2 fails to detect any network cards
installed in MCA slots 8 or higher. Network cards installed in slots 1 through 7
are detected by Windows NT and function normally.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the MCA network adapter was working fine prior to installing Service Pack 2,
you can rename the Ndis.sys file found in the %systemroot%\System32\Drivers
directory and use the Expand utility to expand the Ndis.sys from the compact
disc or copy the Ndis.sys file from the service pack uninstall
$NtServicePackUninstall$ directory and reboot.

-or-

You can physically move the affected network adapter to a lower MCA slot number
in order for the Service Pack 2 Ndis.sys driver to use it.

You usually must re-run the Micro Channel configuration utility to Update your
computer's configuration after moving the MCA network adapter to a different
slot. Consult your computer manufacturer's user guide for complete instructions.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
