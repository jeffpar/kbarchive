Product(s): Microsoft SNA Server
Version(s): WINDOWS:3.0,3.0 SP1
Operating System(s): 
Keyword(s): kbnetwork
Last Modified: 13-JUN-2001

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

AS/400 print jobs fail to print. The 5250 print session configured in SNA Server
Manager changes to a spooling state after the job is sent from the AS/400 and
the Print Manager in Windows NT may also briefly show the print job as spooling.
However, the job does not print.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs after the network connection to the printer is lost and then
reestablished. The 5250 print provider does not recognize that the connection to
the printer was lost, therefore it does not reestablish its connection to the
printer. Any print jobs sent to the printer by way of the 5250 print session
fail to print after the connection drop.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem:

- Stop and restart the SNA Server Host Print service after any network
  connection outage between the SNA Server and the network printer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0 and 3.0
SP1. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

  S E R V P A C K


MORE INFORMATION
================

In the fix referenced above, the 5250 print provider has been updated to correct
this problem. Whenever a new print job is started, the 5250 print provider
checks to see if it still has a valid connection to the printer. If it does not
have a valid connection to the printer, the 5250 print provider will close the
current connection and will open a new one.

Please refer to the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base for
information on another problem with 5250 print sessions recovering after a
connection outage between the SNA Server and the AS/400:
