SYMPTOMS
========

When you debug a project that contains MFC regular (USRDLL) DLLs or ActiveX
Controls (OCX), you may see memory leaks similar to the following reported in
the debugger:

  a CDynLinkLibrary object at $00410F70, 64 bytes long
  a CDynLinkLibrary object at $00410F70, 64 bytes long
  {38} client block at 0x00410D80, subtype 0, 64 bytes long.
  a CDynLinkLibrary object at $00410D80, 64 bytes long
  a CDynLinkLibrary object at $00410D80, 64 bytes long
  {36} client block at 0x00410C60, subtype 0, 64 bytes long.
  a CDynLinkLibrary object at $00410C60, 64 bytes long
  a CDynLinkLibrary object at $00410C60, 64 bytes long

CAUSE
=====

These memory leaks are reported when multiple versions of the MFC DLL are loaded
in the same process. Since MFC extension (AFXDLL) DLLs require the exact same
MFC DLL as the call application, this problem can only occur when using MFC
regular (USRDLL) DLLs or ActiveX Controls (OCX) that use the shared version of
MFC.

The most common case is mixing ANSI (MFC4xd.DLL) and UNICODE (MFC4xxUd.DLL)
versions of MFC in the same process. This can also occur when mixing MFC42d.DLL
and MFC40d.DLL.

RESOLUTION
==========

These memory leak notifications are false, and can be ignored. Since neither
copy of MFC knows about the other ones, it's not easy to stop these false leaks
from being reported. However, it is possible to separate the false leaks from
the potential real leaks. This can be done by overriding CWinApp::ExitInstance()
in both the EXE and DLL and placing TRACE() statements in them:

     int CTestDllApp::ExitInstance()
     {
        TRACE(_T("ExitInstance() for regular DLL: TESTDLL\n"));

        return CWinApp::ExitInstance();
     }

Only the memory leaks that are detected after the last CWinApp::ExitInstance() is
called are true memory leaks.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Consider the following application/DLLs:

    =           =               =            =
    -------------               --------------
               \                 / 
                \               / 
                 \ Calls       / Calls
                  \           / 
                  \/         \/ 
                  -------------
                  =           =
                  =           =
                  =  MSVCR40d =
                  =   (CRT)   =
                  =           =
                  -------------

The MFC Application that is built with the ANSI (MFC40d.DLL) version of MFC calls
the MFC USRDLL, which is built with the UNICODE (MFC40Ud.DLL) version of MFC.
Both MFC versions use the same C run-time (CRT) DLL, MSVCR40d.DLL. Since MFC
USRDLLs are "black-boxes", there should be no problems with calling a UNICODE
MFC USRDLL from an ANSI MFC Application.

However, since the UNICODE (MFC40ud.DLL) and ANSI (MFC40d.DLL) MFC DLLs both use
the same CRT DLL, false memory leaks are reported on all the objects allocated
in the MFC USRDLL. This occurs because MFC relies on the CRT DLL to allocate and
track all memory. It does not separate the memory allocations from the different
versions of MFC. When one of the MFC DLLs unloads, it calls the CRT to do a
memory dump, assuming everything left in the heap is a memory leak. However,
this assumption is incorrect since there are two multiple copies of MFC in
memory.
