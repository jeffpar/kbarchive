SUMMARY
=======

You cannot develop a complete device driver only in C or C++. You must write
some assembly code and you cannot use the majority of functions in the C
run-time library.

The three major problems that occur when you develop a device driver in C are as
follows:

- The .EXE file loader is in COMMAND.COM which is not available when MS-DOS
  loads a device driver. Therefore, a device driver must be the binary image of
  a single-segment program. Microsoft C/C++ version 7.0 introduced the ability
  to generate code in the tiny memory model in which the application stores its
  code and data in one memory segment.

- The C run-time initialization code requires an appropriate PSP (program
  segment prefix) and requires MS-DOS to be available. Even though the source
  code to the startup code is provided with the C compiler, most of the startup
  code is in assembler and would require major modifications to be useful in a
  driver.

- The entry-exit sequences used by C functions are inappropriate for use in an
  MS-DOS driver.

You can work around some of these limitations by using the C compiler to generate
assembly code. The -Fa switch directs the compiler to produce an assembly code
listing that you can edit and use as part of the driver source code. Depending
on the complexity of the MS-DOS device driver, you could write most of the
driver in C and modify and maintain the code relatively easily.
