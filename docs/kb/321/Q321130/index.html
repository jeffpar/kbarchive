The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.1 
- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
- Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A buffer overrun vulnerability exists in Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0,
Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0, and IIS 5.1. By sending a specially
chosen request to an affected Web server, an attacker can either disrupt Web
services or gain the ability to run a program on the server. Such a program runs
with full system permissions in IIS 4.0, and with fewer, but still significant,
permissions in IIS 5.0 and 5.1.

Customers who have used the IIS Lockdown Tool to configure their servers as
static Web servers are already protected against this vulnerability. The URLScan
tool, if it is deployed with the default rule set, also makes it hard to use the
vulnerability to gain control of the server, and likely reduces the
vulnerability to only a denial-of-service attack.

CAUSE
=====

This vulnerability results because of an error that occurs when Active Server
Pages (ASP) parses HTTP header information. An initial check is performed to
make sure that certain expected characters are present and can be used to end a
copy operation. However, the check can be spoofed, thereby enabling a copy
operation that does not end to overrun a buffer.

RESOLUTION
==========

- Internet Information Services 5.1
- Internet Information Services 5.0
- Internet Information Server 4.0
