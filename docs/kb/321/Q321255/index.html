-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server 2000, versions 2000.80.194, 2000.80.380, 2000.81.7713.0, used with:
   - Microsoft Data Access Components versions 2.6, 2.7 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft SQL Server driver that is included with Microsoft
Data Access Components (MDAC) version 2.6 or 2.7, if you call the
SQLDescribeParam function on a connection that is busy with results for another
statement handle, SQL_SUCCESS is returned instead of SQL_ERROR.

This problem does not occur with the SQL Server driver that is included with MDAC
version 2.5.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the return code is not set to SQL_ERROR, even though
you receive the following error message:

  [Microsoft][ODBC SQL Server Driver]Connection is busy with results for
  another hstmt

RESOLUTION
==========

MDAC 2.7
--------

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Microsoft Data Access Components 2.7
service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix has the file attributes (or later) that are
listed in the following table. The dates and times for these files are listed in
coordinated universal time (UTC). When you view the file information, it is
converted to local time. To find the difference between UTC and local time, use
the Time Zone tab in the Date and Time tool in Control Panel.

WORKAROUND
----------

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

- Open a server-side cursor instead of a forward-only, read-only result set to
  avoid the "Connection is busy with results for another hstmt" error message.

- Create a separate connection to execute each query to prevent this error from
  occurring.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a bug in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
