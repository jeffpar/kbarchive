The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the fix from the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article

  Q319733 MS02-018: April 2002 Cumulative Patch for Internet Information
  Services

a Web site may return the following error message:

  HTTP 403.9: Access Forbidden

CAUSE
=====

If a single site is mapped to multiple Domain Name System (DNS) names and
multiple users switch between different DNS names in that site, the connection
count is distorted when a keep-alive connection connects to different host
headers that are mapped to a single site. A phantom connection count is
enumerated each time a connection switches host headers.

RESOLUTION
==========

IIS 4.0:

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Apply it only to

obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone
