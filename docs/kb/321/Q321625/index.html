SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article describes how to limit the computer resources that are
used by the Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0 or Internet Information
Services (IIS) 5.0 services that are running on a Web server.

Limit Computer Resources in IIS 4.0
-----------------------------------

1. Click Start, point to Programs, click Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack, click
  Microsoft Internet Information Server, and then click Internet Service
  Manager.

2. When the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) window opens, expand &lt;Server
  Name&gt;, and then click to select either Default Web Site or the name of the
  Web site that you want to work with.

3. Right-click the Web site, and then click Properties.

4. In the Web Site Properties window, click the Performance tab.

5. On this tab, you can select the estimated hits per day for this Web site by
  selecting one of the three predetermined stop positions with the slide bar.
  Adjust this setting to the number of daily connections that you anticipate
  for your site. If the number is set a little higher than the actual number of
  connections, the connections are made faster and server performance is
  improved. If the number is much higher than the actual connection attempts,
  server memory is wasted, reducing overall server performance.

6. You can also click to select Enable Bandwidth Throttling. Turn on this option
  to limit the bandwidth that this Web site uses. For this Web site only, the
  value that you type for the bandwidth overrides the value that is set at the
  computer level, even if this value is greater than the value that is set at
  the computer level.

Limit Computer Resources in IIS 5.0
-----------------------------------

1. Click Start, point to Programs, click Administrative Tools, and then click
  Internet Services Manager.

2. When the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) window opens, expand &lt;Server
  Name&gt;, and then click to select either Default Web Site or the name of the
  Web site that you want to work with.

3. Right-click the Web site, and then click Properties.

4. In the Web Site Properties window, click the Performance tab.

5. On this tab, you can select the estimated hits per day for this Web site by
  selecting one of the three predetermined stop positions with the slide bar.
  Adjust this setting to the number of daily connections that you anticipate
  for your site. If the number is set a little higher than the actual number of
  connections, the connections are made faster and server performance is
  improved. If the number is much higher than the actual connection attempts,
  server memory is wasted, reducing overall server performance.

6. If you want to, click to select Enable Bandwidth Throttling. Turn on this
  option to limit the bandwidth that this Web site uses. For this Web site
  only, the value that you type for the bandwidth overrides the value that is
  set at the computer level, even if this value is greater than the value that
  is set at the computer level.

7. If you want to, click to select Enable Process Throttling. Turn on this
  option to limit the percentage of CPU processing time that this Web site can
  use for out-of-process applications. If this option is turned on, but Enforce
  limits is not selected, the only result is that an event is written to Event
  Log when the assigned limit is exceeded. Click to select Enforce limits to
  incur consequences for overrunning the limit.
