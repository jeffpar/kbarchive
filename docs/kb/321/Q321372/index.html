-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3) supports the Microsoft
Windows XP Professional operating system. This article describes issues to
consider if you want deploy Windows XP in your existing SMS site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SMS 2.0 SP3 is the minimum requirement for supporting Windows XP Professional as
a client computer. You may also require additional Quick Fix Engineering (QFE)
updates or "hotfixes." QFE hotfixes will be integrated into future services
packs.

NOTE: You can request SMS 2.0 SP3 QFE updates for 60 days after the release of
service pack 4 (SP4). After this date, SP4 is required for additional QFE
support for Windows XP (if you require additional support).

Exclusions
----------

Not all versions of Windows XP are supported by SMS, and not all versions of SMS
support Windows XP. Note the following exceptions:

- Earlier service pack releases of SMS 2.0, including SP2, do not support
  Windows XP Professional as a client.

- SMS 1.2 does not support Windows XP as a client.

- No version of SMS supports Windows XP Home Edition as a client.

- 64-bit versions of Windows XP are not currently supported as SMS 2.0 clients
  in either 32-bit or 64-bit mode.

- Currently, no version of SMS supports Windows XP Embedded as a client.

The following list describes the SMS features that are available to SMS-based
clients that are running Windows XP Professional.

- Feature: Client installation
  Level of support: Fully supported

- Feature: Hardware inventory
  Level of support: Qualified support

For additional information about hardware inventory and Windows XP, click the
article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q310615 Hardware Inventory from Japanese Clients Is Not Added to the SMS
  Database

- Feature: Software inventory
  Level of support: Fully supported

- Feature: Network Monitor
  Level of support: Fully supported

- Feature: Software distribution
  Level of Support: Qualified support
  Description: When you initially install SMS SP3 software distribution, you
  cannot target Windows XP-based clients. This is because Windows XP is not
  known to Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).

  To add Windows XP to the list of specified platforms that SMS uses to target
  software distribution, apply the SP3 hotfix that is described in the
  following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q308271 How to Add Windows XP Professional as a Target Platform to SMS 2.0
  SP3

- Feature: Remote tools
  Level of support: Qualified support
  Description: This feature is supported on SMS-based clients that are running
  Windows XP that have a new accelerated video driver. This driver is delivered
  when you either upgrade the client to SP3 or when you initially install an
  SP3 client.

  Remote tools are supported by using the Run Length Encoding (RLE) compression
  method instead of the default LZH compression method. An SP3 QFE hotfix that
  addresses this problem is included in SP4.

- Feature: Software metering
  Level of support: Qualified support
  Description: There is limited support for software metering of Windows XP. SMS
  cannot perform software metering of 16-bit programs on a Windows XP-based
  client.

NOTE: The SMS 2.0 SP3 Remote Administrators Console (a server role) is also
supported on Windows XP Professional.
