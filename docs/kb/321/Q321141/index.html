- Remove IIS Services in IIS 5.0 and IIS 5.1

SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article describes how to temporarily disable unnecessary
Internet Information Server (IIS) and Internet Information Services (IIS)
services to keep the services from being used except under controlled
circumstances, and how to remove individual IIS services if you have no need for
them.

Disable IIS Services in IIS 4.0
-------------------------------

1. In Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, click Start, click Settings, click Control
  Panel, and then double-click Services.

2. Scroll through the list of services, click to select the service that you
  want to disable, and then click Startup.

3. Click to select Disabled, and then click OK.

4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each service that you want to disable.

5. To exit, click Close, and then close Control Panel.

Remove IIS Services in IIS 4.0
------------------------------

1. In Windows NT 4.0, click Start, click Programs, click Windows NT 4.0 Option
  Pack, and then click Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack Setup.

2. In the Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack Setup window, click Next, and then click
  Add/Remove.

3. Click to select Internet Information Server (IIS), and then click Show
  Subcomponents.

4. Click to clear the check box next to the subcomponent or subcomponents of IIS
  that you want to remove. For example, if you clear the File Transfer Protocol
  (FTP) Server check box, the FTP service will be removed from the Windows NT
  4.0 server.

5. When you have finished clearing the subcomponent check boxes, click OK, click
  Next, and then click Finish.

NOTE: You can use this process to add subcomponents by selecting instead of
clearing the subcomponent check box, but you may have to have the Windows NT 4.0
Option Pack CD available.

Disable IIS Services in IIS 5.0 and IIS 5.1
-------------------------------------------

1. Open Control Panel. To do this with Microsoft Windows 2000 (which uses IIS
  5.0), click Start, click Settings, and then click Control Panel. To do this
  with Microsoft Windows XP (which uses IIS 5.1), click Start, and then click
  Control Panel.

2. In Control Panel, double-click Administrative Tools, and then double-click
  Computer Management.

3. In the left pane of the Computer Management Services window, expand Services
  and Applications, and then click to select Services.

4. In the right pane of the Computer Management window, scroll through the
  services that are listed in the Name column, right-click the service that you
  want to disable, and then click Properties.

5. The service_name window will appear with the General tab selected (note that
  you can click the other tabs at the top of the window to see other options).
  Click the drop-down arrow next to Startup type, and then select Disabled.

6. Click OK.

7. Repeat steps 3 through 6 for each service that you want to disable.

8. Verify that the Status of the service is Started, right-click the service,
  and then click Stop.

9. To exit, close the Computer Management window.

Remove IIS Services in IIS 5.0 and IIS 5.1
------------------------------------------

1. Open Control Panel. To do this with Microsoft Windows 2000 (which uses IIS
  5.0), click Start, click Settings, and then click Control Panel. To do this
  with Microsoft Windows XP (which uses IIS 5.1), click Start, and then click
  Control Panel.

2. In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs. In the Add/Remove
  Programs window, click Add/Remove Windows Components (located in the lower
  left side of the window).

3. In the Windows Component Wizard window, click to select Internet Information
  Services (IIS), and then click Details.

4. Scroll through the list of Subcomponents of Internet Information Services
  (IIS), click to clear the check box next to the subcomponent or subcomponents
  that you want to remove, click OK, click Next, and then click Finish.

NOTE: You can use this process to add subcomponents by selecting instead of
clearing the subcomponent check box, but you may have to have the operating
system CD available.

5. To exit, click Close in the Add/Remove Programs window, and then close
  Control Panel.
