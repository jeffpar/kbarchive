The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.1 
- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
- Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A buffer overrun vulnerability exists in Internet Information Server 4.0 and
Internet Information Services 5.0 and 5.1. By sending a specially chosen request
to an affected Web server, an attacker might either disrupt Web services or gain
the ability to run a program on the server. Such a program would run with full
system permissions in Internet Information Server 4.0, and with fewer, but still
significant, permissions in Internet Information Services 5.0 and 5.1.

Customers who have used the IIS Lockdown Tool to configure their servers as
static Web servers are already protected against this vulnerability. The URLScan
tool, if it was deployed with the default rule set, would also make it hard to
use the vulnerability to gain control of the server, and would likely reduce the
vulnerability to only a denial-of-service attack.

CAUSE
=====

This vulnerability occurs because of a logic error in a function that handles
server-side file includes for ASP pages. The result of the logic error is that
the function might determine that it is safe to store the name of a specified
server-side file in a particular buffer, when in actuality the file name is
longer than the buffer.

RESOLUTION
==========

- Internet Information Services 5.1
- Internet Information Services 5.0
- Internet Information Server 4.0
