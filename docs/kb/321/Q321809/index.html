-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform an insert of double-byte character set (DBCS) characters where
the second byte is an EBCDIC 0x7D, and you use the Host Integration Server OLE
DB Provider for DB2 driver, you may receive the following error message:

  "SQLSTATE:42601 SQLCODE -104"

This error code description indicates that an illegal symbol was encountered in
an SQL statement.

CAUSE
=====

The Host Integration Server 2000 OLE DB Provider for DB2 incorrectly sent a
single-byte stream, which caused the code to incorrectly interpret the 0x7D
(part of the double-byte character) as a quotation mark.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 service pack that contains
this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:
