In the QuickBASIC editor, the ERASE statement frees the memory for an
array DIMensioned in a non-STATIC SUBprogram, even if the $STATIC
metacommand is used. Because the memory for the array has been
deallocated, a "Subscript out of range" error results the next time an
attempt is made to access the array beyond element 10.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in QB.EXE in QuickBASIC
Versions 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50 for MS-DOS. This problem was corrected
in the QBX.EXE environment of Microsoft BASIC Professional Development
System (PDS) Version 7.00 for MS-DOS and MS OS/2 (fixlist7.00).

This behavior does not occur in a compiled .EXE program. In an .EXE
program, a $STATIC array DIMensioned in a SUBprogram that is ERASEd
remains allocated, and the ERASE initializes all elements to their
default value (0 or "").

Workarounds
-----------

The best workaround is to reinitialize the array without using the
ERASE statement. Alternatively, you can DIM the array at the main
module level and share it with the SUBprogram with the SHARED
statement. Both methods ensure that memory for the array is not freed
by ERASE.

Another possible workaround for this problem is to make the SUBprogram
STATIC by placing the STATIC clause on the SUB or FUNCTION statement.
This method should be used with caution. Normally, BASIC allocates
memory for variables in SUBprograms on the stack, and the memory is
released when the SUB is exited. Making the SUBprogram STATIC causes
all variables in the SUBprogram to be permanently allocated, which
permanently reduces the space available for other variables and
strings. A STATIC SUBprogram also has to initialize its own variables,
and a STATIC SUBprogram cannot be recursive.

Code Example
------------

The following program demonstrates the "Subscript out of range" error
caused by erasing an array that was DIMensioned in a non-STATIC
SUBprogram in the QuickBASIC QB.EXE environment:

DECLARE SUB Test ()
CALL Test
END

SUB Test
  DIM A$(100)
  ERASE A$
  PRINT A$(80)           ' "Subscript Out of Range" occurs.
END SUB

Workaround 1
------------

Initialize the array without ERASE, as follows:

DECLARE SUB Test ()
CALL Test
END

SUB Test
  DIM A$(100)
  FOR I = 1 TO 100
      A$(I) = ""
  NEXT
  PRINT A$(80)
END SUB

Workaround 2
------------

DIM the array in the main level of the module and SHARE it in the SUB,
as follows:

DECLARE SUB Test ()
DIM A$(100)
CALL Test
END

SUB Test
  SHARED A$()
  ERASE A$
  PRINT A$(80)
END SUB

Workaround 3
------------

Use a STATIC SUBprogram, as follows:

DECLARE SUB Test ()
CALL Test
END

SUB Test STATIC          'Added STATIC
  DIM A$(100)
  ERASE A$
  PRINT A$(80)
END SUB
