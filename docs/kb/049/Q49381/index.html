Beginning with protected-mode CodeView (CVP) Version 2.30, you can
debug child processes from within a parent process's CodeView session
by invoking CodeView with the /O switch. When the program is executed
to the point where the child process is invoked, CodeView displays a
prompt showing you the child's process ID (PID) and asks, "Do you wish
to debug (y/n)?". Entering "y" brings up the child process and allows
you to debug it. Pressing "n" should cause the child to execute
without any debugging.

Unfortunately, there is a problem in CVP 2.30 that causes CodeView to
hang if you answer no to debugging the child. The only workaround is
to always answer yes when prompted to debug a child process, or to
invoke CodeView without the /O switch because this prevents the prompt
entirely.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with CodeView Version
2.30. We are researching this problem and will post new information as
it becomes available.

If the program you are debugging is not a Presentation Manager (PM)
application, you may be able to kill the CodeView session if it should
hang as a result of answering "n" to the debugging child process. You
must switch to the Task Manager and use it to close the hung CodeView
session. If you are working on a PM application, the only workaround
may be to reboot the computer.
