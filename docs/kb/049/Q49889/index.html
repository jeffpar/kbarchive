Using a CONSTant as the third argument of a PUT statement when writing
to a RANDOM file hangs QB.EXE at run time and during the Make EXE File
command, leaving the word "Binding..." in the lower-left corner of the
screen. This problem occurs only within the QuickBASIC Version 4.50
editor.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in QuickBASIC Version
4.50 for MS-DOS. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here as it becomes available.

When compiled outside the environment, BC.EXE correctly flags the
error with the message "Variable required," displaying the PUT
statement with a caret pointing to the offending CONSTant. The third
argument of the PUT statement requires a variable, and CONSTants are
not allowed.

This problem does not occur in the QBX.EXE environment of Microsoft
BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) Version 7.00 for MS-DOS
and MS OS/2. Within QBX.EXE, the error "Variable required" is flagged
and the offending constant is highlighted.

Code Example
------------

The QuickBASIC editor hangs, displaying the message "Binding..." in
the lower-left corner of the screen, when you run (by pressing
SHIFT+F5) or compile (by using the Make EXE File command on the Run
menu) the following program:

   CONST a = 1
   OPEN "test.dat" FOR RANDOM AS #1
   PUT #1, 1, a
