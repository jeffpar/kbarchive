The clock function is documented as telling how much processor time
has been used by the calling process. This definition is misleading.

The clock function returns a clock_t (long) value, which is the
difference between the time field (for seconds) and millitm field (for
milliseconds) in the structure that is returned from two calls to the
ftime function. The first call to ftime is made within the start-up
code of the executing program, and the second call is made when the
clock function is explicitly called in your code.

This means that the value returned by clock is the number of CLK_TCKs
(milliseconds) elapsed since the start-up code was executed, or -1 if
the function was unsuccessful.

Note: On most IBM PCs and compatibles, the clock speed is not fast
enough to compute milliseconds, or indeed, hundredths of seconds. The
ftime function calls interrupt 21, function 2Ch (under DOS), which
returns, among other information, the seconds in hundredths. The
hundredths information is an estimation from the clock speed, which is
approximately 18.2 ticks per second on most PCs. This hundredths value
is multiplied by 10 to get the millisecond value.

Below is information on resetting the initial time value.

The clock function references an external variable called _citime.
This causes _cinitim.asm to get linked in to the .EXE, which in turn
enters a function called _inittime into the start-up initialization
table.

The _inittime function, which is then called by the start-up code,
simply makes a call to the ftime function, passing it a static timeb
structure. Any further calls to the clock function subtract the values
in this structure from the values in the structure returned by the
ftime call in the clock function.

In some cases, you might want to know the time elapsed between two or
more internal points in a program. To reset the initial time value,
make a call to the function _inittime, which makes a call to ftime,
resetting the initial time structure to the current time. All
subsequent calls to the clock function return the elapsed time since
the last _inittime call.

Other sources of information include the Version 5.10 "Microsoft C for
the MS-DOS Operating System: Run-Time Library Reference," Page 167 and
the clock function in the "C Run-Time Library Source Routines," which
is available as a separate package.
