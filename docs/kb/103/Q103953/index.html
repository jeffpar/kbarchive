Here are some basic protocol requirements within the Microsoft
network architecture:

- Each protocol layer offers one or more services to the functional layer above
  it. For instance, the NetBEUI logical link control (LLC) layer offers
  reliable connection oriented message services, as well as connectionless
  datagram data transfer services.

- Each protocol operates within a well-defined environment, with several
  specific terms and objects. As an example, consider the Microsoft redirector
  server message block (SMB) protocol with its process IDs (PIDs), tree IDs
  (TIDs), multiplex IDs (MIDs) and more.

- Each protocol has its own vocabulary of commands and associated responses
  that it uses in performing its services. NetBEUI's transport layer, for
  example, uses an "add.name.query" command to determine if a given name is
  unique on the network.

- Because each protocol layer needs to add its own header (and sometimes
  trailer) to the network-bound frame, they all have a structured format by
  which they build the frame that they will pass to the layer below.

- For each command/response defined, there is an associated set of procedural
  rules. For example, when the NetBEUI transport protocol "add.name.query"
  command is issued, no response within a configurable time period indicates
  that the specified name is unique on the network, whereas an
  "add.name.response" response indicates that the name is not unique and
  therefore cannot be used.
