SUMMARY
=======

The Backup utility included with Windows NT and Windows NT Advanced Server does
not include functionality for scheduling unattended backups. However, using the
Schedule service in conjunction with the command line capabilities of the Backup
utility, you can set up unattended backups.

The following procedure shows how to use the Schedule service and the Backup
utility to schedule an unattended backup of the entire C: drive of a computer
with an installed tape device. With minor modifications, these steps could also
allow for scheduling unattended backups from a computer on a network to a
computer with a tape device installed or other configurations.

1. Start the Schedule service on the machine with the tape device installed.
  This can be done by using the Services portion of Control Panel, selecting
  Schedule, and choosing Start. In addition, you may wish to configure the
  Schedule service to start every time Windows NT starts by choosing Startup
  and setting the Schedule Service Startup Type to Automatic. Please refer to
  pages 471-472 of the Windows Advanced Server System Guide to verify the
  correct "log on" account needed for local and/or remote backup priviliges.
  For Windows NT, please refer to the System Guide pages 177-178.

2. Using any text editor, such as Notepad, create a command file (MYBACKUP.CMD)
  to perform the commands to backup the requested files.

  The following example would back up all files on the C: drive, replacing any
  files currently on the tape, label the backup set "My Backup Files," backup
  the local registry, and log all backup information to C:\BACKUP.LOG:

  ntbackup backup c: /D "My Backup Files" /B /L "c:\backup.log"

  NOTE: For additional information on available NTBACKUP options, search Windows
  NT Help for NTBACKUP.

3. Using the AT command, schedule the command file (MYBACKUP.CMD) to run when
  desired. The following AT command will schedule MYBACKUP.CMD to execute at
  11:00 P.M. every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday:

  AT 23:00 /every:M,W,F MYBACKUP.CMD

  NOTE: For additional information on available AT options, type "AT /?" at a
  command prompt or search the online Command Reference for AT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Not all ntbackup operations are available from the command line. Use of the GUI
interface is required to do restores using ntbackup. The main reason for the
command line capabilities is for unattended backups of system data.
