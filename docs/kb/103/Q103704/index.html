The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
- Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51

SUMMARY
=======

If you have a Windows NT workstation in a Windows NT Advanced Server domain and
you want to change the machine's computer name, the machine must leave the
domain and rejoin the domain in order for the change to take effect.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Pages 151-152 in the Windows NT "System Guide" instruct you to change a Windows
NT workstation's computer name as follows:

1. Have the Windows NT Advanced Server domain administrator create an account
  for the new computer name.

2. In the Network Settings dialog box, choose the Change button next to the
  computer name.

3. In the Computer Name dialog box, type a unique name (the new name) for the
  computer, and choose OK.

This procedure results in your Windows NT workstation being unable to log on in
the Windows NT Advanced Server domain with any user account. (It makes no
difference if the Windows NT Advanced Server domain administrator creates the
computer name before or after the computer name change.)

If you find that you are unable to log on in an Windows NT Advanced Server domain
after a name change, you should log on to your local database as an admin user.
Next, leave the Windows NT Advanced Server domain by either joining another
Windows NT Advanced Server domain or by selecting any workgroup. After you
reboot the system, your machine can rejoin the original domain with the new
computer name; you will be correctly prompted with the "WELCOME TO THE
&lt;original domain&gt; DOMAIN" message.

NOTE: You cannot add the new computer name for the Windows NT workstation in the
domain by reentering the current domain name and providing an Admin account for
the domain. The machine must leave and rejoin the domain.

Step-by-Step Instructions for Changing a Computer Name on a 
Windows NT Workstation in a Windows NT Advanced Server Domain
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Create a new machine account for the Windows NT workstation in the Windows NT
  Advanced Server domain.

2. Choose the Network icon in Control Panel, choose the Change button next to
  the current domain name, and enter any workgroup name or the name of another
  Windows NT Advanced Server domain.

  NOTE: If you choose another Windows NT Advanced Server domain, you will need
  an administrator of that domain to create a machine account for you in Server
  Manager or you will need to provide an admin account and password so that you
  can add the machine account to the Windows NT Advanced Server domain.

3. Choose the Network icon in Control Panel and change the computer name of the
  Windows NT workstation to the new name.

  NOTE: Once a computer name is changed, the Change button for the domain named
  is dimmed, which indicates that you cannot change the computer name and the
  domain name at the same time unless you change the domain name first, as
  indicated by the order of steps 2 and 3.

4. When prompted, reboot the system in order for the domain name and computer
  name changes to take affect.

5. Log on to the local machine with Admin privileges.

6. Choose the Network icon in Control Panel, choose the Change button next to
  the domain name, and enter the original domain name.

  NOTE: In step 1, you created a new machine account, and as a result, you will
  not need to provide a valid administrator and password for the original
  domain.

  You will receive the "WELCOME TO THE &lt;original domain&gt; DOMAIN" message.

7. When prompted, reboot the system so that the domain name change can take
  effect.

You should now be able to log on to the Windows NT Advanced Server domain with
any valid account.
