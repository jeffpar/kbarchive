-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
- Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows 3.1 uses a VxD that is not compatible
with Windows NT, but there is an unsupported fix located on CompuServe
in the MSLANG32 forum in Library 1 called BETA2FIX. It will patch the
command-line VC++ tools to work with the released version of Windows
NT.

This utility modifies the command-line tools from Microsoft Visual C++
for Windows, version 1.0, so that they will run with the released
versions of Windows NT. BETA2FIX also modifies the .EXE and .DLL files
that were built for versions of Microsoft Windows NT before Beta 2 so
that they can run with the released versions of Windows NT.

The BETA2FIX utility includes the following:

  B2FIX.EXE       - Self-extracting archive containing these files:

  BETA2FIX.EXE    - Program to update files.
  BETA2.DLL       - Support library required by files modified by
                    BETA2FIX.EXE
  BETA2FIX.TXT    - The following text file:

Usage:

To patch an executable file, enter BETA2FIX &lt;filename&gt; at the command
prompt, where &lt;filename&gt; is the name of the file to patch. Wildcards
are allowed in &lt;filename&gt;.

NOTE: BETA2FIX will alter only executable files created before Beta 2;
other files will not be touched.

After modification, the command-line tools from Microsoft Visual C++
for Windows, Version 1.0 will work with Windows NT but not with
Microsoft MS-DOS or Microsoft Windows. To undo the modifications, type
BETA2FIX /U &lt;filename&gt;.

To run a program that has been patched, you must have a copy of
BETA2.DLL in your path (the SYSTEM32 directory is recommended).

Other options:

 /V gives detailed information during patching
 /N suppresses the Microsoft banner
 /T displays all messages but does not modify files

THIS TOOL IS NOT SUPPORTED BY MICROSOFT CORPORATION. IT IS PROVIDED
"AS IS" BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IT MAY BE USEFUL TO CUSTOMERS. WE REGRET
THAT MICROSOFT IS UNABLE TO SUPPORT OR ASSIST WITH THIS TOOL.
