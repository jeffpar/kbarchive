The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Disk space consumption can be a significant concern for users of version 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows. Mail Remote is often used on a portable
computer with relatively limited disk space.

The Mail Remote for Windows Setup program requires your mail administrator to
create a data disk for you to install this product. One of the files created for
this data disk is RNETWORK.GLB, which contains the postoffice and user
information.

In large installations, this file may not fit on a single floppy disk (which is
all you are prompted for). Also, you will need to have enough free disk space on
your computer so that all the addresses can be expanded from your RNETWORK.GLB
address file.

If your data disk files will not fit on a single floppy disk, you can perform the
following steps:

1. Create a directory on your hard disk drive and use the MS-DOS SUBST command
  to store the data files, such as:

  c:
  md\data
  subst a: c:\data

  NOTE: For more information on the SUBST command, please see your MS-DOS
  documentation.

2. When you use the Administrator program to create your data disks, select
  drive A as the drive to store the files on. When you install Mail Remote for
  Windows, type C:\DATA when you are asked where the data files are.

You must create enough free space on your local hard drive for all the address
books. You can either delete some other files, or build a Custom View that is
small enough to fit on your computer's hard disk drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can predetermine the approximate size of RNETWORK.GLB before it is created
by the Administrator program, and then estimate the amount of file space
required for the address books created by Mail Remote for Windows as it expands
the RNETWORK.GLB information.

When Building RNETWORK.GLB
--------------------------

  Component                      Size
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  Each network                   20 bytes
  Each gateway                   20 bytes
  Each postoffice                24 bytes
  Each PROFS, SNADS, or OV node  24 bytes
  Each user                      Max 10 bytes for e-mail name + max
                                 30 bytes for friendly name
  Each template                  11 bytes + .TPL file size

When Expanding RNETWORK.GLB
---------------------------

  Component                      Size
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

  Each local user                1217 bytes
  Each network                    122 bytes
  Each gateway                    122 bytes
  Each external postoffice        698 bytes
  Each PROFS, SNADS or OV node    698 bytes
  Each external user               53 bytes
  Each template file             Size of .TPL file
  Each person on the GAL         Minimum 90 bytes (because everyone
                                 goes on the GAL, that is 90+ bytes
                                 for every user)

NOTE: The only gateway users you can add through RNETWORK.GLB are PROFS, SNADS,
and OfficeVision. These users can be added by creating a Custom View. They
require the same amount of space as mail users.
