SYMPTOMS
========

When you define an Inbox Assistant rule to automatically move messages to a
public folder, this rule is not activated until you log in to a client.

CAUSE
=====

This is by product design.

WORKAROUND
==========

One workaround to the problem of not being able to automatically move messages
into public folders is to create a rule that will forward (instead of move) the
messages to the public folder. This rule will be performed even when you are not
logged in.

If the public folder is not listed in the Global Address List, the Microsoft
Exchange administrator must first complete the following steps in the Microsoft
Exchange Administrator program:

1. Select the public folder and then get its properties by selecting the
  Properties command on the File menu.

2. Select the Advanced page. Clear the Hide From Address Book option. This will
  make the folder appear in Global Address List.

3. In the Microsoft Exchange client, create an Inbox Assistant rule to forward
  messages to the public folder.

4. After you create the rule, if the folder needs to be removed from the Global
  Address List, check the Hide From Address Book option in the Properties of
  the public folder in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Any rule actions that move a message to a message store other than a user's
server-based mailbox store must be run on the client while the user is logged
in.

This is the case when moving messages to a local .PST file, as well as when
moving messages to a public folder. Public Folders may or may not reside on the
same server as a user's mailbox.

In order to move a message to a store, a user must be logged in to that store
with the proper permissions to post items. The rules engine (which processes
Inbox Assistant rules) cannot log in to another store (with the necessary
Windows NT privileges) as the user who created the rule. Instead, it creates a
Deferred Action message to tell the client to execute this rule. When the client
logs in to the server, the Deferred Action message is sent to the client, which
then performs the action specified in the rule.
