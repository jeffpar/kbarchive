SYMPTOMS
========

After a report has been generated using the Report Wizard, the report bands
(Detail, Group or Page Header bands) act as if they cannot be shrunk above the
position of a memo field or a long character field, even if the memo or long
character field and its label has been deleted or moved.

CAUSE
=====

When other fields lie below the memo or long character field, the Report Wizard
adds an invisible line below each memo field and long character field to control
the floating characteristics of these fields and their labels.

RESOLUTION
==========

If it is necessary to edit a Wizard-generated report, ensure that the line below
the memo or long character field is moved with these fields or is deleted from
the report.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design. The Report Wizard adds the invisible line below
these fields that have a potential to grow and float to keep the labels
positioned with their respective field.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Report Wizard should always add an invisible line below a memo or long
character field when there are other fields are below these fields. The Report
Wizard's apparent threshold width of the character field before placing a line
underneath is around 60 to 65 characters. Of the three types of Report Wizards,
the standard Report Wizard and the One-to-Many Report Wizard seem to exhibit
this behavior most. In the standard Report Wizard, it is usually the Detail band
that appears to not shorten. In the One-to- Many Report Wizard, it could be the
Group Header, the Detail band, or both, depending on whether a memo or long
character field is added to the respective band.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open the Employee table in the Vfp\Samples\Data subdirectory.

2. On the Tools menu, click Wizards, and then click Report.

3. Select the Report Wizard, and click OK.

4. In the Available Fields list, scroll down and move Notes to the Selected
  Fields list. Then move the First_Name and Last_name fields to the Selected
  Fields list.

5. Click the Next button twice until Step 3 is reached. In the Step 3 - Layout
  dialog box, click Rows in the Field Layout section.

6. Click Finish. In Step 5 - Finish, select the "Save report and modify it in
  the Report Designer." Click the Finish button, and give the report a name.
  Then click Save.

7. With the report open in the Report Designer, select the Last Name label
  control, and press the DELETE key or choose Clear from the Edit menu. Repeat
  this process for the First Name label and the Last_name and First_name
  fields.

8. Try to close the Detail band by clicking the band itself and dragging it
  upward, or double-click the Detail band, reduce the height spinner value, and
  choose OK.

The Detail band should not close up all the way to the notes field. This is
because of the invisible line.

To find out where the lines are, choose Select All from the Edit menu, or use the
mouse to draw and drag a selection box along the right edge of the report above
the Detail band. The Select All method will select all controls on the report
but should show the selection handles at either end of the line. They appear as
small gray boxes at the left and right edges of the report. If you need to see
the line, be sure the line is selected, and then choose Pen from the Format
menu. Change the point size to something other than None.

NOTE: It may be necessary to move the Detail band down to view the selection
boxes of the line, especially if the Detail band was moved up against the
invisible line in Step 8.
