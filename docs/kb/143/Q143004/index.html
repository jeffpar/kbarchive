SUMMARY
=======

This article contains information about the tools included with Microsoft
Windows 95 Service Pack 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following tools are included with Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1.

Microsoft Batch Installation Utility Version 2.0 for Windows 95
---------------------------------------------------------------

Usage:

The Microsoft Batch Installation Utility (Batch.Exe) is a tool designed to
provide a user interface for creating Msbatch.Inf files for scripted setups. By
running this program and answering as many or as few questions as desired,
Windows 95 Setup procedures can be made completely automatic.

Batch Setup version 2.0 includes the following new features:

- You can have Batch Setup scan your Windows 95 registry and create an .inf
  file based on your current settings. For more information about which
  registry settings Batch Setup can retrieve, search Batch Setup Help.

- You can now specify which protocol to make the default from within the Batch
  Setup program.

- More settings are available to configure File and Print Services for
  Microsoft Networks or File and Print Services for NetWare networks.

- Administrators can now choose whether to disable the Netcard Resource
  Conflict Resolution Wizard during setup. (This option is disabled by
  default.)

- With one click, you can enable or disable all optional components in a single
  area.

- Batch Setup finds user-level security settings.

- Locates client TCP/IP settings (for example, DNS servers).

To start Windows Batch Setup click Start and select Programs. Click Windows Batch
Setup. Selections can be made by placing a check mark in the appropriate
selection you wish to automate. Please see the online help for instructions on
running Windows 95 Setup in Batch Mode.

Support Boundaries:

The Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS) Desktop Systems Unit supports the
functionality and operation of the tools for the creation of Msbatch.inf files
and the files created with them. The Desktop Systems Unit does not support the
functionality of manually edited Msbatch.inf files.

Microsoft INF Generator Utility for Windows 95
----------------------------------------------

Usage:

The Microsoft INF Generator Utility is a tool for generating individualized
Msbatch.inf files for multiple computers. For detailed usage instructions,
please see the Infgndoc.doc file included with the tool.

Support Boundaries:

The Microsoft PSS Desktop Systems Unit supports the functionality and operation
of the tools for the creation of Msbatch.inf files and the files created with
them. The PSS Desktop Systems Unit does not support the functionality of
manually edited Msbatch.inf files.

Microsoft INF Installation Tool for Windows 95
----------------------------------------------

Usage:

You can use the Microsoft INF Installation Tool to integrate .inf (and related)
files from the various tools folders contained in the Admin folder on the
Windows 95 CD-ROM.

To use this tool, first run Netsetup and create a network installation of Windows
95. Then, use the INF Installation Tool to add external components (such as the
SNMP agent in the Admin\Nettools\SNMP folder) to the Netsetup tree and
(optionally) force the installation of the components using a batch script.

Support Boundaries:

The Microsoft PSS Desktop Systems Unit supports the functionality and operation
of the tools for the creation of Msbatch.inf files and the files created with
them. The Desktop Systems Unit does not support the functionality of manually
edited Msbatch.inf files.

The functionality of Infinst.exe is not supported with all .inf files. Due to the
differences in the structure of some .inf files, they cannot be integrated into
an automated install with Infinst.exe.
