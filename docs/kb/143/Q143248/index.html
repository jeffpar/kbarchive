-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Starting Tastrade.app causes the following error message to appear:

  Variable "TITLE" is not found.
  &lt;Cancel&gt; &lt;Suspend&gt; &lt;Ignore&gt; &lt;Help&gt;

If you click Ignore, the error message will appear with NOTES replacing TITLE as
the variable not found. This will occur several more times, each with a
different variable such as PHOTO_FILE and PASSWORD.

NOTE: The error is not displayed immediately upon starting Tastrade.app if the
introductory screen appears. To cause the error message to appear, click the
Continue button on the Introductory form.

CAUSE
=====

COMPATIBLE has been set to ON or DB4.

WORKAROUND
==========

The short-term solution is to issue the following command in the Command window
before running Tastrade.app:

     SET COMPATIBLE OFF

The permanent solution is to modify the Environment class in the Tsgen class
library as described below.

Step-by-Step Workaround
-----------------------

1. Open the Tastrade.pjx project file located in the VFP\Samples\Mainsamp
  directory.

2. Click the Classes tab. Drill down in the Tsgen class library, and select the
  Environment library. Click the Modify button to edit the library.

3. With the Environment class open in design mode, click New Property on the
  Class menu. In the Name box, enter the following variable name:

  " cOldCompatible " (without the quotation marks)

4. Ensure that the properties sheet of the class is open by choosing Properties
  from the View menu. Click the Methods tab on the properties sheet.

5. Double-click the Init event, and add the following line of code at the end of
  the current code:

     this.cOldCompatible = SET('COMPATIBLE')

  Close and save the Init event.

6. From the Methods tab in the Property sheet, double-click the Reset method,
  and add the code at the end of the current code:

     lutemp = this.cOldCompatible
     SET COMPATIBLE &amp;lutemp

  Close and save the method.

7. Double-click the Set method in the Methods tab of the Property sheet and
  enter the following line of code at the end of the current code:

     SET COMPATIBLE OFF

  Close and save the method.

8. Close and save the Environment class. In the Project Manager, click the Build
  option button, and then click Build Application under options, and choose OK.
  The Save As dialog box appears. Either take the default name for the
  application, or enter a new name to leave the original application intact if
  necessary.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem has been fixed in Visual FoxPro 5.0
for Windows.

  COMPATIBLE=ON

     SET COMPATIBLE ON

- By choosing Options from the Tools menu; then clicking the General tab, and
  selecting the dBASE Compatibility check box.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In Command window, type "SET COMPATIBLE ON" (without the quotation marks), or
  select the dBASE Compatibility check box in the General tab the Options
  choice on the Tools menu.

2. Run \Vfp\Samples\Mainsamp\Tastrade.app

3. Click the Continue button on the Introductory form if you see it.

4. The following program error is displayed:

  "Variable 'TITLE' is not found."
  &lt;Cancel&gt; &lt;Suspend&gt; &lt;Ignore&gt; &lt;Help&gt;

  different variable not found.
