-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to perform a backup, restore, or compare operation in Microsoft
Backup, or close Backup after performing one of these operations, you may
receive the following error message:

  Microsoft Backup has encountered a serious error in the Memory Manager.
  Quit and restart Backup, and then try again.

CAUSE
=====

This error can occur for any of the following reasons:

- An incompatible device driver or memory-resident program is being loaded in
  the Autoexec.bat, Config.sys, System.ini, or Win.ini file.

- The Windows swap file is damaged.

- The tape drive or backup tape you are trying to use is damaged or
  incompatible with Backup.

- One or more Backup files may be damaged.

- The memory in your computer is faulty.

NOTE: If the above error message is displayed when you attempt to perform a
restore operation in Microsoft Backup, the problem may also be caused by the
method Backup uses to read restore information in some situations dealing with
compression. For information about the updated Backup.exe file that corrects
this problem, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q147656 Updated Backup Corrects Erasing Data and Memory Manager Errors

3. Click Disk Tools, and then click Details.

4. Click the Backup check box to clear it, click OK, and then restart your
