SYMPTOMS
========

When you play a .WAV file on a Creative Labs Sound Blaster 16 card, the playback
may sound broken and have a heavy reverberation.

CAUSE
=====

You have installed the Windows 3.1 drivers for the Sound Blaster 16 card. There
is a known problem with the mono compressor/decompressor (codec) included with
the Windows 3.1 Sound Blaster 16 drivers.

RESOLUTION
==========

You may be able to resolve this problem by installing the updated audio codecs
included with Windows 95. To install the updated codecs, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the Add/Remove Programs icon.

2. Click the Windows Setup tab.

3. In the Components box, click Multimedia.

4. Click the Details button.

5. Click the Audio Compression check box to select it.

6. Click the OK button.

7. Insert the appropriate Windows 95 disks as requested.

If the distortion continues, you may need to install the Windows 95 Sound Blaster
drivers. To install these drivers, you must first remove the Windows 3.1
drivers. Please refer to the Creative Labs documentation for information about
removing the Windows 3.1 drivers.

After you have removed these drivers and restarted your computer, you can use the
Add New Hardware Wizard to detect the Sound Blaster 16 card and automatically
install the Windows 95 drivers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem is specific to the IMA ADPCM mono codec. All the other codecs work
properly. You can play a stereo IMA ADPCM .WAV file without problems.

Creative Labs has released updated drivers for their Sound Blaster 16 sound card.
Windows 95-compatible drivers from Creative Labs are available on the Creative
Labs World Wide Web site. The updated drivers are available as a file named
Sbw95up.exe dated 6/4/96. These drivers may resolve the issue described in this
article.
