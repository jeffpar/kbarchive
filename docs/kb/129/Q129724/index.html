The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51

SYMPTOMS
========

When Services for Macintosh (SFM) is installed on a Windows NT 3.5 Server,
Macintosh clients periodically appear to stop responding, even if they are not
directly accessing a mounted volume (the client is waiting for a response from
the Windows NT server). The amount of time that a client waits for a response
from the server depends on the volume layout and how many files are in each
directory.

CAUSE
=====

When a shared directory is initially accessed by a Macintosh client, SFM must
read the entire contents of the directory and update the sub-section of the
volume catalog. If there are many files in the directory (several thousand), the
volume is exclusively locked until the catalog is updated. This causes other
Macintosh clients to wait for their requests to be satisfied.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, upgrade to Windows NT 3.51 (if you have not already
done so) and install the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT version 3.51.

Microsoft has modified the Windows NT version 3.51 file, SFMSRV.SYS, to correct
these problems. SFM Servers configured with large Macintosh Accessible Volumes
will still have large amounts of disk activity when the server starts or when a
volume is created. This may go on for several minutes depending on how large and
complex directory structures are.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5 and 3.51.
This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT
version 3.51. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
