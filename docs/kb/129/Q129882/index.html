SUMMARY
=======

Visual Basic allows you to retrieve data from various databases by using
Structured Query Language (SQL). These query operations can be made more
efficient by implementing some of the suggestions in this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Here are some tips for optimizing your SQL queries:

- Compact your database. To do this, use the CompactDatabase statement as in
  this code:

        DBEngine.CompactDatabase "C:\VB\BIBLIO.MDB","C:\VB\BIBLIO2.MDB"
        ' Do other things here ...
        Kill "C:\VB\BIBLIO.BAK"
        Name "C:\VB\BIBLIO.MDB" As "C:\VB\BIBLIO.BAK"
        Name "C:\VB\BIBLIO2.MDB" As "C:\VB\BIBLIO.MDB"
   

  This speeds up queries because it writes all the data in a table into
  contiguous pages on the hard disk. Scanning sequential pages is much faster
  than scanning fragmented pages.

- Avoid expressions in query output. Exressions in query output can cause query
  optimization problems if that query is later used as the input to another
  query. In the following example, the Query1 query is used as input for a
  second query:

        Dim DB As Database
        Dim RS As RecordSet
        Set DB = DBEngine.Workspaces(0).Opendatabase("Biblio.MDB")
        DB.CreateQueryDef("Query1", "SELECT IIF([Au_ID]=1,"Hello","Goodbye")_
           AS X FROM Authors")
        Set RS = DB.OpenRecordSet("SELECT * FROM Query1 WHERE X='Hello'")
   

  Because the IIF() expression in Query1 cannot be optimized, the query in the
  OpenRecordSet also cannot be optimized. If an expression gets buried deeply
  enough in a query tree, you can forget that it is there. As a result, your
  entire string of queries cannot be optimized.

  Here's a better way to write the second query:

        Set RS = DB.OpenRecordSet("SELECT * FROM Authors WHERE [Au_ID]=1")

- Place GROUP BY clauses in the same table as aggregates. This is an issue when
  you are joining two tables. For example, if you join two tables on the
  Customer Name field, and then run a query that performs a GROUP BY operation
  on the Customer Name field, make sure that both the GROUP BY field (Customer
  Name) and the field that is in the aggregate (Sum, Count, and so on) come
  from the same table.

- When you create a "totals" query, use the GROUP BY clause on as few fields as
  possible. The more fields in the GROUP BY clause, the longer the query takes
  to execute.

- If possible, place a GROUP BY clause on a table before joining it to another
  table, rather than joining the two tables and doing the GROUP BY in the same
  query as the join. For example, instead of this query:

        SELECT Orders.[Company ID], Count(Orders.[Order ID]) AS
           [CountOfOrder ID] FROM Customers INNER JOIN Orders ON
           Customers.[Customer ID] = Orders.[Customer ID] GROUP BY
           Orders.[Company Name];

  Break the query into two separate queries, such as these:

        SELECT Customers.[Company ID] FROM Customers GROUP BY
           Customers.[Company ID];

        SELECT Orders.[Customer ID], Count(Orders.[Order ID]) AS
           [CountOfOrder ID] FROM Q1 INNER JOIN Orders ON Q1.[Customer ID] =
           Orders.[Customer ID] GROUP BY Orders.[Customer ID];

- When joining tables, try to index the fields on both sides of a join. This
  can speed query execution by allowing the query optimizer to use more
  sophisticated internal join strategy.

- Index fields as much as possible. If a database is not updated frequently,
  place an index on all fields that are used in a join or in a restriction.
  With the use of Rushmore query optimization technology in Microsoft Access
  version 2.0, the Microsoft Jet database engine is able to take advantage of
  multiple indexes on a single table, which makes indexing multiple fields
  advantageous.

- Try to construct your queries so that Rushmore technology can be used to help
  optimize them. Rushmore is a data-access technology that permits sets of
  records to be queried very efficiently. With Rushmore, when you use certain
  types of expressions in query criteria, your query will run much faster.

  Rushmore does not automatically speed up all your queries. You must construct
  your queries in a certain way for Rushmore to be able to improve them.

- Use COUNT(*) rather than COUNT([Column Name]) to determine the number of
  records in a table. This is faster because there are special optimizations in
  the Microsoft Jet database engine that allow COUNT(*) to be executed much
  faster than COUNT([Column Name]).
