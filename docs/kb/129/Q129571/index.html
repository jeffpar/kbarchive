- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When a form set contains a Data Environment, the BeforeOpenTables event and the
OpenTables method of the Data Environment are triggered before the Load event of
the form set. This article explains the reason behind this implementation and
offers a workaround if you want the Load event to execute before the tables are
opened.

CAUSE
=====

The Load event of a form set usually sets the environment of a form. In
particular, it can be used to bind data to controls on a form. Therefore, in
most cases, tables and views must be loaded before the LOAD event of a form set
is executed. Thus, the OpenTables method of the data environment is, by default,
called before the Load event of the form set is executed.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you do not want the tables or views to be opened when the Load event of a
form set is executed, set the AutoOpenTables property of the form to .F.. You
can then call the OpenTables method of the data environment to open the tables
automatically. For example, use the following command in any method of the
form:

     THISFORMSET.DataEnvironment.Opentables

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Following is the sequence of events that are executed when a form set created in
Visual FoxPro version 3.0 is loaded or unloaded. The order of events might
differ if the form is converted from a FoxPro version 2.x screen. In this
example, the form set is named FORMSET1 and contains a form named FORM1 and a
data environment called DATAENVIRONMENT. This list was generated by executing
the following code for the following events and methods:

     ACTIVATE SCREEN
     ?PROGRAM()

     FORMSET1.LOAD
     .DATAENVIRONMENT.OPENTABLES
     .DATAENVIRONMENT.BEFOREOPENTABLES
     FORMSET1.FORM1.LOAD
     FORMSET1.DATAENVIRONMENT.INIT
     FORMSET1.FORM1.INIT
     FORMSET1.INIT
     FORMSET1.SHOW
     FORMSET1.ACTIVATE
     FORMSET1.FORM1.ACTIVATE
     FORMSET1.FORM1.GOTFOCUS
     FORMSET1.FORM1.QUERYUNLOAD
     FORMSET1.DESTROY
     FORMSET1.FORM1.DESTROY
     FORMSET1.FORM1.UNLOAD
     FORMSET1.UNLOAD
     FORMSET1.DATAENVIRONMENT.CLOSETABLES
     FORMSET1.DATAENVIRONMENT.AFTERCLOSETABLES
     FORMSET1.DATAENVIRONMENT.DESTROY

NOTE: The OPENTABLES method calls the BEFOREPOPENTABLES event before the tables
are actually opened. However, the code in the event handler is executed before
the tables are opened, and this is the reason why OPENTABLES prints before
BEFOREOPENTABLES prints.

For more information about the sequence of events that are triggered when a form
runs, execute the sample program called EVENTS.SCX located in the
SAMPLES\CONTROLS\EVENTS directory.
