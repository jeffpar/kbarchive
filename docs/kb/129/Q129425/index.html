SUMMARY
=======

This article gives you tips that can be used with the Debug window to help you
debug forms.

MORE INFORMATION
================

THIS and THISFORM Keywords
--------------------------

The THIS and THISFORM keywords can only be used in a class definition. Because an
object has been instantiated when a form is running, the THIS and THISFORM
keywords only reference the form object when a method is executing. You can use
the form's name to reference it in the Debug window. A generic way to refer to
the active form is to place the following expression on the left side of the
Debug window:

     _SCREEN.ACTIVEFORM

The "(object)" word that is presented on the right side of the Debug window will
signify that an object reference to the form exists.

How to Verify the Method Currently Executing
--------------------------------------------

To verify the method currently executing, type PROGRAM() in the Debug window. For
example, if you have defined code for the Load event, the right side of the
Debug window will read FORM1.LOAD when the Load event is executed.

How to Verify the Name of the Active Control in a Form
------------------------------------------------------

To verify the name of the active control in a form, type:

       _SCREEN.ACTIVEFORM.ACTIVECONTROL.NAME

This expression returns the name of the member object, such as Command1.

How to Verify the Name of the Container of an Active Control
------------------------------------------------------------

To verify the name of the container of an active control, type:

     _SCREEN.ACTIVEFORM.ACTIVECONTROL.PARENT.NAME

How to Suspend Execution of the Form
------------------------------------

You can suspend execution of the form by setting a breakpoint in the Debug
window. For example, to verify the order in which methods are executed when you
run a form, you can place PROGRAM() on the left side of the Debug window. This
function is updated each time a method or the code associated with an event is
executed. If you set a breakpoint in the Debug window by clicking the center
bar, the execution of the form will be suspended each time the value returned by
PROGRAM() is modified.
