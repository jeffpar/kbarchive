SYMPTOMS
========

Using Non-reserved keywords followed by a colon may produce different results in
Visual Basic version 4.0.

A reserved keyword in Visual Basic cannot be used as the name of a user-defined
function. However, a non-reserved keyword may be used as the name of a
user-defined function.

In Visual Basic version 4.0 a non-reserved word followed by a colon is
interpreted as a line label. Previous versions of Visual Basic checked to see if
this is a statement followed by another statement on the same line.

Similar behavior occurs when you use a user-defined subroutine with no parameters
followed by a colon and another statement.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid the confusion that this could potentially cause, Microsoft recommends
that you use colons only for line labels. Write each individual statement on a
separate line. Not only does this allow you to avoid confusion, it also makes
your code easier to read.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Place a command button (Command1) on the form.

3. Place the following code inside the Command1 click event:

     Print "Hello"
     Cls: Beep

4. Run the program by choosing Start from the Run menu.

5. Click the Command1 button.

In Visual Basic version 4.0, the word Hello is printed on the form and a beep
sounds. In previous Visual Basic versions, Hello is printed, and then erased;
then the beep sounds.

Additional query words: 4.00 vb4win vb4all
