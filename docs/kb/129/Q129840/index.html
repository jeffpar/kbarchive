The information in this article applies to:

- MSPRESS Advanced Windows ISBN 1-55615-677-4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article contains information on known errors, corrections, and comments
relating to the Microsoft Press book "Advanced Windows: Developer's Guide to
Windows NT 3.5 and Windows 95."

The following topics are covered:

- Page 6: First Paragraph, Last Sentence Is Misleading

- Page 494: pvData in Sample Code Should Be pData

- Page 502: Missing "not" in Second to Last Sentence

MORE INFORMATION
================

In addition to a description of the book's problems, this document might also
include sections labeled "Correction" and "Comments." Please note that the
"Correction" section is worded for correcting the book and does not necessarily
address the problem introduced by the book error. The "Comments" section
contains specific information for working around problems.

Page 6: First Paragraph, Last Sentence Is Misleading
----------------------------------------------------

The last sentence in the first paragraph on page 6 reads as follows:

  On Windows 95, a new thread of execution cannot be created because Microsoft
  didn't feel that the function was useful enough to warrant the additional
  memory overhead required to make Windows 95 run in a 4-MB machine.

As this sentence stands, the reasoning for omitting the CreatRemoteThread() API
function is unclear and the effect on Windows 95 is misleading.

Correction:

Change this sentence to the following:

  On Windows 95, the CreateRemoteThread() function is not fully implemented
  because Microsoft didn't feel that the function was useful enough to warrant
  the additional memory overhead of the function, given that Windows 95 is
  required to run on a 4-MB machine.

Page 494: pvData in Sample Code Should Be pData
-----------------------------------------------

In the sample code, change

     static PVOID pvData = NULL

to

     static PVOID pData = NULL

Page 502: Missing "not" in Second to Last Sentence
--------------------------------------------------

On page 501, there is a code fragment that uses DisableThreadLibraryCalls in an
attempt to avoid a deadlock condition. On that same page, the text states that
this approach did not solve the problem.

However, the continued discussion on page 502 describes a mutex object that is
created with each process and states "Because the system works this way, adding
the call to DisableThreadLibraryCalls does prevent the threads from
deadlocking."

Correction:

In the second to last sentence on page 502, change

  DisableThreadLibraryCalls does prevent

to

  DisableThreadLibraryCalls does not prevent

Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
