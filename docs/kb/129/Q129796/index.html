SUMMARY
=======

Executing the Shell() function in a Visual Basic for Windows program starts
another executable program asynchronously and returns control to the Visual
Basic application. This shelled program continues to run independently of your
application until the user closes it.

However, if your Visual Basic application needs to wait for the shelled process
to terminate, you could use the Windows API to poll the status of the
application, but this is not a very efficient technique. The example in this
article demonstrates a better way.

A 16-bit application would use a completely different technique to accomplish the
same effect.

  below to view the article on the 16-bit process in the Microsoft Knowledge
  Base:

  Q96844 HOWTO: Determine When a Shelled Process Has Terminated

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Win32 API has integrated functionality that enables an application to wait
until a shelled process has completed. To use these functions, you need a handle
to the shelled process. The easiest way to achieve this is to use the
CreateProcess() API function to launch your shelled program rather than Visual
Basic's Shell() function.

Creating the Shelled Process
----------------------------

In a 32-bit application, you need to create an addressable process. To do this,
use the CreateProcess() function to start your shelled application. The
CreateProcess() function gives your program the process handle of the shelled
process through one of its passed parameters.

Waiting for the Shelled Process to Terminate
--------------------------------------------

Having used CreateProcess() to get a process handle, pass that handle to the
WaitForSingleObject() function. This causes your Visual Basic application to
suspend execution until the shelled process terminates.

Getting the Exit Code from the Shelled Application
--------------------------------------------------

It was common for a DOS application to return an exit code indicating the status
of the completed application. While Windows provides other ways to convey the
same information, some applications only provide exit codes. Passing the process
handle to the GetExitCodeProcess() API allows you to retrieve this information.

Following are the steps necessary to build a Visual Basic for Windows program
that uses the CreateProcess() function to execute the Windows Notepad
(Notepad.exe) application. This code demonstrates how to use the Windows API
CreateProcess() and WaitForSingleObject() functions to wait until a shelled
process terminates before resuming execution. It also uses the
GetExitCodeProcess() function to retrieve the exit code of the shelled process,
if any.


The syntax of the CreateProcess() function is extremely complicated, so in the
example code, it is encapsulated into a function called ExecCmd(). ExecCmd()
takes one parameter, the command line of the application to execute.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Form1:

     Private Type STARTUPINFO
        cb As Long
        lpReserved As String
        lpDesktop As String
        lpTitle As String
        dwX As Long
        dwY As Long
        dwXSize As Long
        dwYSize As Long
        dwXCountChars As Long
        dwYCountChars As Long
        dwFillAttribute As Long
        dwFlags As Long
        wShowWindow As Integer
        cbReserved2 As Integer
        lpReserved2 As Long
        hStdInput As Long
        hStdOutput As Long
        hStdError As Long
     End Type

     Private Type PROCESS_INFORMATION
        hProcess As Long
        hThread As Long
        dwProcessID As Long
        dwThreadID As Long
     End Type

     Private Declare Function WaitForSingleObject Lib "kernel32" (ByVal _
        hHandle As Long, ByVal dwMilliseconds As Long) As Long

     Private Declare Function CreateProcessA Lib "kernel32" (ByVal _
        lpApplicationName As String, ByVal lpCommandLine As String, ByVal _
        lpProcessAttributes As Long, ByVal lpThreadAttributes As Long, _
        ByVal bInheritHandles As Long, ByVal dwCreationFlags As Long, _
        ByVal lpEnvironment As Long, ByVal lpCurrentDirectory As String, _
        lpStartupInfo As STARTUPINFO, lpProcessInformation As _
        PROCESS_INFORMATION) As Long

     Private Declare Function CloseHandle Lib "kernel32" _
        (ByVal hObject As Long) As Long

     Private Declare Function GetExitCodeProcess Lib "kernel32" _
        (ByVal hProcess As Long, lpExitCode As Long) As Long

     Private Const NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS = &amp;H20&amp;
     Private Const INFINITE = -1&amp;

     Public Function ExecCmd(cmdline$)
        Dim proc As PROCESS_INFORMATION
        Dim start As STARTUPINFO

        ' Initialize the STARTUPINFO structure:
        start.cb = Len(start)

        ' Start the shelled application:
        ret&amp; = CreateProcessA(vbNullString, cmdline$, 0&amp;, 0&amp;, 1&amp;, _
           NORMAL_PRIORITY_CLASS, 0&amp;, vbNullString, start, proc)

        ' Wait for the shelled application to finish:
           ret&amp; = WaitForSingleObject(proc.hProcess, INFINITE)
           Call GetExitCodeProcess(proc.hProcess, ret&amp;)
           Call CloseHandle(proc.hThread)
           Call CloseHandle(proc.hProcess)
           ExecCmd = ret&amp;
     End Function

     Sub Form_Click()
        Dim retval As Long
        retval = ExecCmd("notepad.exe")
        MsgBox "Process Finished, Exit Code " &amp; retval
     End Sub

3. Press the F5 key to run the application.

4. Using the mouse, click the Form1 window. At this point the NotePad
  application is started.

5. Quit NotePad. A MsgBox appears indicating termination of the NotePad
  application and an exit code of 0.

  NOTE: The MsgBox statement following the ExecCmd() function is not executed
  because the WaitForSingleObject() function prevents it. The message box does
  not appear until Notepad is closed when the user chooses Exit from Notepad's
  File menu (ALT, F, X).
