SUMMARY
=======

When two or more variables of different types are involved in an expression,
Visual Basic uses a set of internal type coercion rules to change the different
types into a single type. For every combination of input and result types, there
is a specific coercion rule. (Contrary to some speculation, Variants are not
involved.) This makes Visual Basic faster and more efficient, but it can produce
some puzzling results if you aren't aware of what Visual Basic is doing behind
the scenes. This article lays out some of the less obvious conversion rules,
their benefits, and some possible scenarios where this can lead to unexpected
results.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Coercion between numeric types is pretty straightforward. Smaller types
(integer) coerced to larger types (double) simply have their value assigned.
Larger types (double) coerced to smaller types (integer) have their value
assigned, but generate an Overflow error if the smaller type cannot contain the
larger type's value. Other coercion rules are not as obvious.

NOTE: Any type can be implicitly coerced to any other type (excluding objects).

  Source Type    Coerced to      Apply this rule
  --------------------------------------------------------------

  Integer        Boolean         0=False, non-zero=True

  Boolean        Byte            False=0, True=255

  Boolean        any numeric     False=0, True=-1
                 (except Byte)

  String         Date            String is analyzed for mm/dd/yy,
                                 and so on

  Date           numeric type    Coerce to Double and use
                                 DateSerial(Double)

  numeric type   Date            Use number as serial date, check
                                 valid date range

  numeric type   Byte            Error if negative

  String         numeric type    Strings are treated as a Double
                                 when they need to represent a
                                 number

Some of these rules allow for simplified syntax when writing your code. For
example:

  ReturnCode% = FunctionThatReturnsAnInteger()
  If (ReturnCode%) Then ...

This piece of code takes advantage of the implicit Integer to Boolean coercion
and correctly evaluates the expression in the If statement.

Note on Strings as Numbers
--------------------------

Treating Strings as Doubles when they need to represent a number gives the String
the maximum possible range and nearly the best possible precision (only Currency
can have more precision, at a sacrifice in range). Because these coercions are
generated by the compiler, the rule must be decided up front without regard to
the actual content of the string.

Note that "treating as Double" is not quite the same as "coercing to Double." For
example, addition and subtraction operators treat Currency as a preferable type
to Double. Currency plus String will be treated as Currency plus Double, which
would use Currency addition. Thus the string will be coerced directly to
Currency.

Why Use Coercion Rules?
-----------------------

The largest reason is performance. Hard-coded coercion rules make Visual Basic
version 4.0 faster and more efficient and provide backward compatibility to
previous versions of Visual Basic. One of the big speed advantages comes because
Visual Basic version 4.0 now knows the data type of control properties. Knowing
the type of properties provides trememdous performance advantages. Without it,
for example, setting a property required Basic to package the value in a
Variant, and the control to unpack and coerce it to the right type. Now the
control knows it is receiving the correct specific type, and Basic does a direct
coercion to that type without ever involving the overhead of a Variant.

Unexpected Results
------------------

The following code pieces show a few common scenarios where errors can be
generated by Visual Basic if types and coercion rules are not carefully
considered:

     Dim I As Integer, J As Integer
     Dim L As Long, M As Long
     Dim S As String

     I = 32767
     L = 32767
     M = 1
     S = "Hello World!"

     J = I + 1
     ' Overflow. Integer upper limit = 32767. No coercion applied.

     J = I + M
     ' Overflow. I+M is coerced to a Long and the value 32768 is generated,
     ' but when the assignment operator is resolved, this Long value is
     ' coerced back to Integer (J's type) and overflows.

     L = I + 1
     ' Overflow. Coercion is not applied until the assignment operator is
     ' resolved. I + 1 'Overflow's the temporary Integer variable created
     ' to resolve the plus operator.

     If I Then Print "I is True"
     If Not I Then Print "Not I is True"
     ' This prints both 'I is True and Not I is True', a logical
     ' contradiction. The value of I = 32767, which is non-zero and under
     ' the Integer to Boolean rule, is coerced to True. With 'Not I',
     ' the NOT operator is applied first, which produces -32768 which is
     ' also non-zero and, therefore, True.

The following scenario shows how implicit conversion can generate a variety of
unexpected results. You can add this code to a new program and run it too see
the output.

     Private Sub Form_Click()
        Call MySub(1, 23) '&lt;-- Note: passing *numbers*!
     End Sub

     Private Sub MySub (a As String, b As String)
        Debug.Print "a = "; a, , TypeName(a)
        Debug.Print "b = "; b, , TypeName(b)
        Debug.Print "a + b = "; a + b, , TypeName(a + b)
        Debug.Print "a + b - 1 ="; a + b - 1, TypeName(a + b - 1)
        Debug.Print "1 - a + b ="; 1 - a + b, TypeName(1 - a + b)
        Debug.Print "a + b + 1 ="; a + b + 1, TypeName(a + b + 1)
        Debug.Print "1 + a + b ="; 1 + a + b, TypeName(1 + a + b)
        Debug.Print "(1 + b) / a ="; (1 + b) / a, TypeName((1 + b) / a)
     End Sub

The output is:

  a = 1             String
  b = 23            String
  a + b = 123       String
  a + b - 1 = 122   Double
  1 - a + b = 23    Double
  a + b + 1 = 124   Double
  1 + a + b = 25    Double
  (1 + b) / a = 24  Double
