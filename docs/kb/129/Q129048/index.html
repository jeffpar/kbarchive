-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows NT on a computer that has a NetFlex32 card and more
than 16 MB of physically memory, Setup may not be able to start the network. At
the network settings box during the graphical user interface (GUI) portion of
Setup, the following error may appear:

  Network could not start because dependency services failed to start.

CAUSE
=====

This error is caused by a problem with the Netflex32 card and the Windows NT
hardware abstraction layer (HAL) that loads during setup; the HAL to fails to
allocate enough memory to start the services.

If the computer is the first on the network, and going to be a primary domain
controller (PDC), you can continue installing Windows NT; the card will work
properly when machine is rebooted. If the computer is going to be a backup
domain controller (BDC), and must talk to the PDC to finish installing, Setup
will not complete successfully.

This problem has been attributed to Compaq's NetFlex32 driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, either install Windows NT over the network, or
bring the machine down to 16 MB of RAM. This will allow the services to install
properly and finish installation. Once the machine is running Windows NT, the
RAM can be re-installed.

Compaq has verified this to be a problem with the Netflex32 driver and should
have a fix in Compaq Support Software Diskette (SSD) version 1.14 or later.
