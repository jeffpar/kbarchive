Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

After you download SCHMSG.EXE to a clean directory, double-click it to extract
the contents of the file. You should receive the following files:

  SCHEDMSG.DLL (75,952 bytes, dated 04-12-95, 10:33 P.M.)
  README.TXT

To replace your SCHEDMSG.DLL file
---------------------------------

1. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER:

  " copy schedmsg.dll &lt;destination&gt; " (without the quotation marks)

  where &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory where your SCHEDMSG.DLL
  file currently resides. For example, if SCHEDMSG.DLL is located in the
  MAILEXE directory on drive C and you ran the self-extracting file from the
  TEST directory on drive D, type the following command:

  " copy d:\test\schedmsg.dll c:\mailexe " (without the quotation marks)

2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

  " copy &lt;mailexe&gt;\setup.inf &lt;mailexe&gt;\setupinf.old " (without the
  quotation marks)

  where &lt;mailexe&gt; is the complete path to the directory containing the
  Microsoft Mail for Windows SETUP.EXE program. For example, if SETUP.EXE is
  located in the MAILEXE directory on drive C, type the following command:

  " copy c:\mailexe\setup.inf c:\mailexe\setupinf.old " (without the quotation
  marks)

3. Using any text editor, edit the SETUP.INF file. In the [MSMAIL] section,
  replace the following line

  1, schedmsg.dll,,,, 1993-03-09, !DECOMPRESS,, OLDER, !READONLY,,,,,SHARED,
  75936,,,, 3.2.0.4027,

  with:

  1, schedmsg.dll,,,, 1995-04-12, !DECOMPRESS,, OLDER, !READONLY,,,,,SHARED,
  75952,,,, 3.2.0.4086,

  Save the file and close the text editor.

  NOTE: For these changes to affect the entire network, each existing user must
  run Setup again.
