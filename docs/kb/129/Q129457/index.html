SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 3 (SP3) installed provides the capability to
restrict anonymous users from obtaining system information. For more
information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q143474: Restricting Information Available to Anonymous Logon Users

However, with RestrictAnonymous access enabled, anonymous connections are able to
obtain the password policy from a Windows NT Server. The password policy defines
the Windows NT domain policy with respect to the minimum password length,
whether blank passwords are permitted, maximum password age, and password
history.

Anonymous access to the password policy information is used by Windows NT to
provide end-users detailed error information under specific circumstances. If
the user is required to change their password at the next logon, and the user
enters a new password that is rejected because of the password policy, Windows
NT can tell the user why the password was rejected. The password policy is
obtained by the system before the user has completed the logon and therefore
uses an anonymous connection.

For example, assume there is a password policy that requires a minimum password
length of 8 characters and a history that remembers the last 5 passwords. If the
user chooses a new password of 6 characters, or enters a previous password, they
see a detailed error message with the following information:

  Your password must be at least 8 characters long. Your new password cannot be
  the same as any of your previous 5 passwords.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has a fix available that disables anonymous access to password policy
information when the RestrictAnonymous access is enabled. When the hotfix is
applied and RestrictAnonymous is enabled, anonymous connections cannot obtain
password policy information.

Microsoft recommends installing the hotfix on all domain controllers that have
Service Pack 3 installed.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.



MORE INFORMATION
----------------

If the user performs the same steps outlined in the example above after the
hotfix is installed, they receive the following error message:

Your new password does not meet the minimum length or password history
requirements of the domain.

The user should consult the account administrator to determine the password
policy in effect for their account domain.
