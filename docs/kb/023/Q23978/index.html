Question:

I am trying to declare some far data in small model, but I keep
getting "Warning 40: near/far/huge ignored" with C Version 4.00, or
the same warning with the number C4040 using C Versions 5.x. Does this
mean I cannot declare far data in the small model?

Response:

The far data can be declared in the small-memory model. This warning
means that the far descriptor is improper and/or unnecessary in the
context in which it is being used. Far or huge arrays should be
defined outside of functions, or with the static storage class if
defined within functions.

It also may mean you are trying to make the type of pointer definition
"char * far pvar;" within the body of a function. This definition
attempts to define a pointer to data (either near or far, depending on
the memory model) and place it in a far data segment outside the
default data segment. This process only will work properly if it is a
global definition, or if it is defined as static within the body of
the function.

Please note the difference between the above definition and defining a
pointer to far data, which is "char far *pvar;". The latter definition
declares a pointer that can point to data outside the default data
segment, but the pointer itself is within the default data segment.
This declaration is quite acceptable within the body of a function.
