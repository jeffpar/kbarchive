SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Connection Manager Administration Kit (CMAK) included with the
Spanish version of the Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack, if a phone book is published
and used by CMAK, the phone book entries do not display. When you go to Settings
and click the Phone Book button, all entries are blank.

NOTE: This problem does not appear when the English (US) version of the Windows
NT 4.0 Option Pack is used.

CAUSE
=====

The Cmpbk32.dll file was converted to the localized version by mistake.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the following fix by contacting Microsoft
Technical Support or wait for the next Windows NT 4.0 service pack.

This fix should have the following time stamp:

     10/29/97  01:57p               28,848 cmpbk32.dll (Intel)
     10/29/97  01:57p               50,448 cmpbk32.dll (Alpha)


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Connection Manager
Administration Kit included with the Spanish version of the Windows NT 4.0
Option Pack.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next service pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
