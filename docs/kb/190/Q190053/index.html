The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Outlook 98 Deployment Kit 
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to add other programs to the Active Setup to
Customize install packages created by the Outlook Deployment Kit (ODK.)

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can add custom components to the Active Setup during Stage 2 of the Outlook
Deployment Wizard. You can add up to 10 custom components which your users may
install along with Outlook and other Microsoft components you have selected.
These custom components may be provided in the form of a self-extracting file or
a compressed cabinet (.cab) file.

It is recommended that you sign any custom code. Code-signing lets users know
that they can trust your code before installing it on their computers. The
default settings in Setup (and Internet Explorer) will reject unsigned code.

Below are definitions of the various boxes that need to be filled out at this
stage.

Component
---------

Type the name of your component in this box.

Location
--------

Type the path to your program, or click Browse to search for it.

Command
-------

If you specify a .cab file, you must also specify a command to run it.

GUID
----

If your program already has a globally unique identifier, or GUID, type it in
this box. If your program doesn't have a GUID, then click Generate to assign a
GUID. A GUID establishes a unique identity for programs, objects, and other
items.

Parameter
---------

You can specify any switches to run with your program.

Size
----

Type the size of your program in kilobytes (KB).

Version
-------

The version number helps you track versions of your program and ensure that the
latest version is installed.

Uninstall key
-------------

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

This is the registry entry, or key, for your uninstall program. Registering your
uninstall program enables users to remove your program by clicking the
Add/Remove Programs icon in Control Panel. To register your uninstall program,
add the entries for your application to the Uninstall subkey:

  HKEY_LOCAL_computer\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ 
  Uninstall\ApplicationName\UninstallString

  ApplicationName = the display name of your program

  UninstallString = path [ switches ]

Both the ApplicationName and UninstallString values must be supplied and be
complete for your uninstall program to appear in Control Panel. The path you
supply to UninstallString must be the complete command line used to carry out
your uninstall program. The command line you supply should carry out the
uninstall program directly rather than from a batch file or subprocess.

Verify
------

Programs installed over the Internet typically need "digital signatures" that
identify their source and guarantee that the code hasn't changed since it was
signed. Depending on safety settings, users can be warned before the program is
downloaded. Certificate authorities can supply public and private keys needed to
sign code. To determine whether the program has been digitally signed, click
Verify.

For current information about code signing, see the Microsoft Web site.

Tools for building .cab files and creating Internet Express scripts are included
in the ODK. Additional tools are available in the Microsoft Internet Client
Software Development Kit (SDK). For more general information about Active Setup
technology, see Active Setup.
