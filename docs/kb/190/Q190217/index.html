SUMMARY
=======

In 16-bit versions of Visual Basic, you can determine free system resources by
calling the GetFreeSystemResources Windows API function. For 32-bit versions of
Visual Basic, there is no Win32 API function that provides that information. To
determine free system resources in a 32-bit Visual Basic application, you must
call a 16-bit application. This article includes instructions to:

1. Create a 16-bit Visual Basic 4.0 OLE server that determines free system
  resources and provides that information to OLE clients.

2. Call the 16-bit OLE server from a 32-bit version of Visual Basic and get free
  system resources from it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If your Visual Basic application loads a very large number of certain controls,
such as ComboBoxes, you may run out of system resources, which will result in an
"out of memory" error (error #7), and may cause Windows to stop responding. You
can monitor system resources with the 16-bit Windows API function
GetFreeSystemResources.

In Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows Me, GetFreeSystemResources checks the
percentage of free memory in the following five resource heaps:

1. The 16-bit User heap (64K).

2. The 32-bit User window heap (2MB).

3. The 32-bit User menu heap (2MB).

4. The 16-bit GDI heap (64K).

5. The 32-bit GDI heap (2MB).

First, it finds the lowest of the three User heaps, and the lowest of the two GDI
heaps. The 16-bit, 64K heaps are almost always the lowest.

Next, for each of the two lowest, it divides the percentage free by the
percentage that was free when Windows was started.

Finally, it returns the lowest of the two.

For example, suppose the five heaps had the following percentages free at the
time Windows started:

  Heap                              Percentage Free
  =============================     ===============
  16-bit User heap (64K)            80%
  32-bit User window heap (2MB)     99%
  32-bit User menu heap (2MB)       99%
  16-bit GDI heap (64K)             75%
  32-bit GDI heap (2MB)             99%

Later, with some applications running, suppose the free memory in the five heaps
had dropped to these percentages:

  Heap                              Percentage Free
  =============================     ===============
  16-bit User heap (64K)            40%
  32-bit User window heap (2MB)     98%
  32-bit User menu heap (2MB)       98%
  16-bit GDI heap (64K)             25%
  32-bit GDI heap (2MB)             98%

GetFreeSystemResources starts by finding the lowest of the three User heaps
(40%), and the lowest of the two GDI heaps (25%). In both cases, the 16- bit,
64K heap is lowest.

Next, GetFreeSystemResources divides the percentage free by the percentage that
was free when Windows was started. For the User heap, that's 40%/80% = 50%. For
the GDI heap, it calculates 25%/75% = 33%.

Finally, it returns the lowest of the two, 33%.

Note, this behavior is different than GetFreeSystemResources in Windows 3.1 in
two ways:

1. The three 2MB heaps did not exist in Windows 3.1.

2. It did not divide the percentage free from the percentage that was free at
  the time Windows started. As a result, it returned a lower percentage. In the
  example above, GetFreeSystemResources in Windows 3.1 would have returned 25%
  instead of 33%.

There is no 32-bit version of GetFreeSystemResources. In Windows 95, 98, Me, NT,
and 2000, GetFreeSystemResources has been replaced by GlobalMemoryStatus, which
returns the amount of free global memory. Because Windows 95, 98, Me, NT, and
2000 handle system resources more efficiently than Windows 3.x, system resources
are usually less of a concern and free global memory is usually more relevant.
GlobalMemoryStatus is sometimes confused as being equivalent to
GetFreeSystemResources, but in fact it is designed to return entirely different
information. While GetFreeSystemResources returns the free percentage of the GDI
and User heaps, GlobalMemoryStatus returns the amount of free global memory. In
Windows 3.x, 95, 98, and Me, Windows allocates a fixed amount of memory to each
of the GDI and User heaps at startup, and can never allocate any more to them no
matter how much global memory is free. As a result, it is possible to run out of
free system resources while there is still abundant free memory. Because
GlobalMemoryStatus does not return information about the GDI and User heaps, it
is not appropriate to use GlobalMemoryStatus to monitor these system resources.

To determine free system resources in a 32-bit Visual Basic application, you must
create and call a 16-Bit application that calls GetFreeSystemResources and
exposes the information to other applications.

Note that Windows NT (all versions) and Windows 2000 is designed to dynamically
allocate memory to the GDI and User heaps as needed. GetFreeSystemResources
always returns 90% on Windows NT and 2000. Unlike other versions of Windows,
Windows NT and 2000 do not run out of system resources and stop responding. It
is highly unlikely that your Visual Basic application will have any need to
monitor system resources on Windows NT and 2000.

Also note that Windows 95, 98, and Me manage system resources considerably more
efficiently than Windows 3.x. Many items formerly stored in the 64K User and GDI
heaps in Windows 3.x are now stored in the three 2MB heaps in Windows 95 and 98.
See the REFERENCES section below for more information.

The following steps show how to create a 16-bit Visual Basic 4.0 OLE server that
determines free system resources and provides that information to OLE clients,
and to call the 16-bit OLE server from a 32-bit version of Visual Basic and get
free system resources from it.

Note, the OLE Server must be created with 16-bit Visual Basic 4.0; it cannot be
created with Visual Basic 5.0 or later, or with 32-bit Visual Basic 4.0.

If you do not have Visual Basic 4.0, but do have Visual Basic 1.0 for Windows,
2.0, or 3.0, you can use DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange) rather than OLE to provide
the information to 32-bit applications. In Visual Basic 3.0, see chapter 21 in
the Visual Basic Programmer's Guide, "Communicating with Other Applications."

If you are a C programmer, you can create a "flat thunking" DLL to provide the
information on Windows 95, 98, and Me. You cannot do flat thunking directly in
Visual Basic, because it requires calling functions given only pointers to their
addresses in memory. See the REFERENCES section below for where to find more
information.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Start 16-bit Visual Basic 4.0. Note this will not work with 32-bit Visual
  Basic 4.0, or with Visual Basic 5.0 or later.

2. Create a new project. Form1 is added by default.

3. Choose Module from the Insert menu to add a standard module, and add the
  following code to it:

        Declare Function GetFreeSystemResources Lib "User" _
           (ByVal fuSysResource As Integer) As Integer

        Const GFSR_SYSTEMRESOURCES = &amp;H0

        Sub Main()
           'Stub only.
        End Sub

4. Choose Class Module from the Insert menu to add a class module, and add the
  following code to it:

        Public Function SystemResources()

           SystemResources = GetFreeSystemResources _
              (GFSR_SYSTEMRESOURCES)

        End Function

5. Change the Name property of the class module to clsSR.

6. Change the Instancing property of the class module to Createable SingleUse.

7. Change the Public property of the class module to True.

8. Alternate click on Form1 in the Project window, and choose "Remove File" to
  remove the default form.

9. Choose Options from the Tools menu, and select the Project tab. Change the
  project name to prjSR, and then change StartMode to "OLE Server."

10. From the File menu, save the project, and make the EXE.

11. Start a 32-bit version of Visual Basic, such as Visual Basic 4.0 32-bit, or
  version 5.0 or later.

12. Create a new project. Form1 is added by default.

13. Choose References from the Project menu (in 32-bit Visual Basic 4.0, choose
  References from the Tools menu), and check prjSR. Click OK.

14. Double-click on Form1, and add the following code to the Form_Load event:

        Dim oSR As New prjSR.clsSR

        MsgBox oSR.SystemResources &amp; _
           "% of system resources are free."

        Set oSR = Nothing

15. Run the project. The Message Box will show the percentage of free system
  resources.
