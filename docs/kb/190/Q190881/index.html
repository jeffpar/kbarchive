SUMMARY
=======


Analyze6.exe is a file that contains the Analyze version 6.00.8169 utility.
Analyze detects and validates all files in the database. It also enables you to
fix any potential errors and remove files that are no longer active in the
Visual SourceSafe database.

The Analyze utility is a 32-bit utility that you can run under Windows NT,
Windows 95, or Windows 98 in conjunction with the 32-bit Visual SourceSafe
libraries. However, when you run it with the -f switch, it attempts to fix any
data file in the SourceSafe Data directory, regardless of which platform the
file originated from.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: If you have upgraded to Microsoft Visual Studio Service Pack 5 (or later),
you already have an improved version of the Analyze tool. For information on the
latest service pack, see the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/ssafe/downloads/updates.asp

The following files are available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  Analyze6.exe

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.


To install the Analyze utility, create a blank directory, copy Analyze6.exe to
the directory, and run it. Analyze6.exe is a self-extracting file that contains
Analyze.exe version 6.00.8169:

  ssapi.dll
  ssus.dll
  mfc42.dll
  msvcrt.dll
  readme.txt

NOTE: Do not install these files in the VSS\Win32 directory because it might
disable the 32-bit version of Visual SourceSafe.

When you run Analyze version 6.00.8169, all messages will scroll in the Analyze
Results window. In the Analyze Results window, Analyze reports any errors it
encounters and the fixes it performs. This information is also recorded in the
Analyze.log file. Analyze contains a progress indicator in the status bar that
lets you know the status of the clean up.

If Analyze makes any changes to a file, it stores the file in a Backup directory,
which, by default, is a subdirectory of the SourceSafe Data directory or of the
directory that you run Analyze from. If the process does not finish, you can
recover the original files (as they were before you started Analyze).

By default, Analyze locks the data files while it analyzes them. Therefore, no
one should be in Visual SourceSafe when you analyze the data files.

Switches
--------

There are several switches in Analyze that allow you to perform functions on your
database or individual files in the Data directory. These switches are:

  Switch     Description
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------

  &lt;none&gt;     Analyze.exe, with no parameters, reports any errors that it
             encounters in the database. This is similar to the behavior
             of previous versions of Analyze. For example:

             ANALYZE c:\ss\data
             ANALYZE f:\ss\data\a\abaaaaaa

             The Analyze Results window is displayed in Windows NT or
             Windows 95. This window scrolls any errors it encounters.

  -f         Fix. This enables Analyze to fix most of the errors it
             encounters. To be successful, no users can be in Visual
             SourceSafe. However, users can have files checked out. The
             Visual SourceSafe administrator should wait until all users
             are not running Visual SourceSafe before running Analyze with
             the -f switch.

             You need to have at least 16 MB of free hard drive space
             available to run Analyze with the -f switch. In addition,
             you should make enough hard drive space available for the
             Backup directory. The size of the Backup directory is
             determined by the number of corrupted files that Analyze
             encounters.

             Example:

             ANALYZE ..\data -f


  -i-        This switch enables you to keep the results window from
             appearing. Example:

             ANALYZE f:\ss\data -i-

  -v         Verbose Logging. This allows Analyze to return all
             information about the Analyze process to the lower pane of
             the Analyze Results window. The upper pane of the Analyze
             Results window is reserved for error conditions, and you
             cannot turn it off. The -v switch has four option parameters
             that indicate the amount of verbosity reported. By default,
             it runs as -v1, which only shows errors. The -v4 option shows
             all errors and informational messages. The other two options,
             -v2 and -v3, fall in between. If no number is included, it
             defaults to -v1.

  -c        Compress. The -c switch allows Analyze to compress unused
            comments that might exist in log files and free-up disk space.
            However, this process is considerably slower and you should
            not run it frequently. For example, you would have extraneous
            information if you add a file and supply a comment at the time
            of the Add and then you go back to the Properties on that file
            later and change the comment. Now both comments are stored in
            the data file. However, you cannot get access to the first
            comment. If you run Analyze with -c and it discovers two
            comments for a file, it rewrites the data file and leaves out
            the older comment. While this switch can reduce the size of
            the database in some cases, it usually does not make a
            significant difference.

  -d        Delete. -d enables Analyze to delete files that no longer have
            valid references in Visual SourceSafe, such as files that were
            branched into another project at one time, but no branched
            versions of the file are now active in the database. Analyze
            does an extensive comparison between projects and determines
            which files can be successfully removed from the Data
            directory. However, this can drastically slow down the Analyze
            process so you might not want to perform this frequently.
            Allow enough time for successful completion when you use the
            -d switch. This switch reduces the size of the database only
            if there are files that no longer have valid references in
            Visual SourceSafe.

  -b        Different backup directory. -b allows you to specify a
            different backup directory. Make sure there is enough space in
            this location to hold your entire Data directory contents,
            should this be necessary.

  -x        Do not lock. -x instructs Analyze not to lock the files as it
            analyzes the database, so users can still use Visual
            SourceSafe while Analyze is running. However, this switch
            cannot be used with the -f, -d, and -c switches.
