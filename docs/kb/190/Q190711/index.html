-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to perform directory replication between two sites over the
Internet Mail Service (Internet Mail Connector in version 4.0), the following
error message may appear:

Event ID 2245
Source:  MSExchangeMTA
Category:  Directory Access

Directory Operation failed with problem DS_E_NO_SUCH_OBJECT. Attribute.
Directory Name [String];
\o=Organization\ou=Organizational_Unit\cn=Configuration\cn=Servers
\cn=Server_Name\cn=Microsoft DSA.  [RD server DISP; Router 11  114] [8]

CAUSE
=====

There may be two possible causes for this problem:

- The value of the following registry key:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services
     \MSExchangeMTA\Parameters\X500 DN


  does not match the corresponding Exchange directory entry. In this case, the
  message transfer agent (MTA) service does not start. For more information,
  please see Knowledge Base article Q155027, "XCON: Unable to Start Microsoft
  Exchange MTA; Errors 1067 &amp; 2140."

  -OR-

- If a site uses an MX wildcard record, the MX wildcard record directs all
  messages to that site. This can mean that the Internet Mail Service tries to
  send messages to its own IP address. For more information, please see
  Knowledge Base article Q150969, "XFOR: All Messages Sent Over IMC Result in
  NDRs."

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do the following:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

A.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:

     System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMTA\Parameters\X500 DN

3. Check the VALUE for this key. The Organization [o=], Site [ou=], and Server
  Directory names [cn=] must exactly match the properties of the Organization,
  Site, and Server objects as displayed in Microsoft Exchange Administrator
  program.

  To see whether these objects match the value of the registry key, do the
  following:

  a. Click each of these objects in the left pane of the Microsoft Exchange
     Server Administrator program.

  b. On the File menu, click Properties. The Directory Name of each of these
     objects should exactly match the corresponding attribute in the registry
     setting described above.

B.
If you are experiencing this problem with the Internet Mail Service or IMC, you
can add a registry value to prevent it. The registry key is:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet
  \Services\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters

From the Registry Editor menu, click Edit, and then click the Add Value option.

  Value Name: DisableResolverSearchList
  Data Type: REG_DWORD
  Value: 1 (or any non-zero value)

This entry is case-sensitive and should be typed exactly as shown above. You must
restart the Internet Mail Service for the registry key to take effect.

If the problem cannot be addressed by the information in either Q155027 or
Q150969, you must remove the wildcard record from the DNS server.
