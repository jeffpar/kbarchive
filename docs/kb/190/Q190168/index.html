-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Outlook 97, versions 8.0, 8.01, 8.02, 8.03 
- Microsoft Outlook 98 
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use an Outlook client to connect to an Exchange Server computer
remotely and try to synchronize your offline storage file (OST), the dial- up
connection may dial by using the wrong connectoid. (The connectoid appears on
the screen with a message that includes the number being dialed, which is not
the number you want.) If you hang up and connect again by going to the Tools
menu and clicking Synchronize, the correct connectoid will be used. This
behavior may repeat itself upon subsequent synchronizations and cycle back and
forth between the two connectoids.

CAUSE
=====

The above behavior occurs if two different dial-up connectoids are created. The
first is used for Internet Explorer version 4.0 or later and is configured to
"Connect to the Internet using a Modem" on the Connections tab of Internet
Explorer Properties. A second connectoid is configured to allow an Outlook
client to automatically connect and synchronize with an Exchange Server
computer.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are two possible ways to work around this issue:

Method 1
--------

1. In the Properties for Internet Explorer, select View, Internet Options, and
  the Connections tab. Select "Connect to the Internet using a local area
  network". This allows Internet Explorer to open and browse after a connection
  is established to your Internet Service Provider (ISP).

2. Start Outlook offline. On the Tools menu, click Synchronize. This allows the
  connection to be made using the correct connectoid as it was configured in
  the Dial Up Networking properties for the Outlook client. (To configure this,
  on the Tools menu, click Services, click Microsoft Exchange Server, and then
  click Properties. Select the Dial-Up Networking tab.)

3. To browse using Internet Explorer, double-click the dial-up connectoid to
  connect to the ISP. Then you can open Internet Explorer for browsing.

Method 2
--------

1. In the properties for Internet Explorer, select View, Internet Options, and
  the Connections tab. Select "Connect to the Internet using a Modem".

2. Configure the connection to be made with the dial-up connectoid that dials
  the Internet Service Provider (ISP). This allows a connection to be made to
  the ISP when you double-click the Internet Explorer icon.

3. Change the Dial-Up Networking properties for the Outlook client to "Do not
  dial, Use existing Connection". To do this, on the Outlook menu bar, click
  Tools, and then click Services. Select Microsoft Exchange Server, and then
  select Properties. Click the Dial-Up Networking tab, and select "Do not dial,
  Use existing Connection".

4. To connect to the RAS server that allows access to the Exchange Server
  computer, first double-click the dial-up connectoid and make the connection.
  Then open the Outlook client. On the Tools menu, select Synchronize to
  synchronize your OST.
