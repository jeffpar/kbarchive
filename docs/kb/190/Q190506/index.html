The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

The following symptoms may occur:

- Replication or scavenging may stop if Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)
  encounters either of the following events. Your WINS server may log one of
  the following events in the system event log in Event Viewer:

  Event ID : 4262
  Source : WINS
  Type : Error
  Description: WINS got an error while trying to register a unique replica with
  name &lt;computername&gt;. The replica is owned by WINS with address given
  below.

  Event ID : 4261
  Source : WINS
  Type : Error
  Description: WINS got an exception while trying to register a group's replica
  with name &lt;groupname&gt;. The replica is owned by WINS with address given
  below.

- 1C records may show an expiration date of forever "-.-" after replication
  occurs to a replication partner. This may cause an "access violation" error
  message when you use Winscl.exe to view records in a WINS database.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may be caused by the following:

- WINS stops replication or scavenging encountered a record that was in an
  unexpected state, for example the replica of a special group that has all
  members timed out but the state is not tombstone or a replica that is in the
  released state.

- WINS is modifying the record time-to-live (TTL) value during replication. The
  TTL of the name is set to 0xFFFFFFF resulting in the infinite expiration
  date.

RESOLUTION
==========

A fix is now available that does the following:

- WINS is modified so that, during replication/scavenging, if WINS encounters
  an exception while trying to register a group or unique replica, the record
  is overwritten, ownership is determined by the most recent registration, and
  replication/scavenging continues.

- WINS is modified such that, when group members are unioned, Windows NT
  changes the ownership only if a bigger list is created. The time stamp for
  the record is also modified to verify the interval instead of 0xFFFFFFFF,
  which resulted in the expiration date.

- There has also been a change to how 1C records are treated with migrate on
  enabled. In the past, after a 1C record was initialized as static, the only
  way to get the record back to dynamic was to delete the record on all servers
  and restart the servers. Now the record is changed to dynamic if the owning
  wins server changes the record to dynamic.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following WINS events 4262 and 4261 have changed from Event Type Error to
Event Type Informational.

These binaries also fix a problem where, after replication occurs, the 1C list
renewal interval is changed to forever "-.-" and may cause access violations
when using Winscl.exe.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
