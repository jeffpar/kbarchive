If Mail Recipient Is Missing When You Click Send To on the File Menu
--------------------------------------------------------------------

If Mail Recipient is missing when you click Send To on the File menu, follow
these steps to install Windows Messaging:

1. Quit all Windows applications.

2. Install the Windows Messaging component (Wms.exe) located on your Windows 98
  CD-ROM in the following folder:

  &lt;CD Drive Letter&gt;:\Tools\Oldwin95\Message\US\

  NOTE: Double-click the Wms.exe file to start the Windows Messaging Setup
  program.

3. After Windows Messaging Setup is complete, restart Windows.

If You Get Error Messages When You Click Mail Recipient
-------------------------------------------------------

If you receive the error messages listed in the "Symptoms" section of this

  e-mail program" check box.

5. Click to select the "Make Outlook Express my default Simple MAPI client"
  check box.

  When you click to select this option, the following message will appear:

  Enabling Outlook Express as your Simple MAPI client will allow you to send
  documents from other programs using the Send command on the File menu. You
  should do this if Outlook Express is the only mail program you use.

  Other MAPI-enabled applications such as Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft Outlook,
  Windows Messaging, and the Mail Merge feature in Microsoft Word will be
  disabled if you make Outlook Express your Simple MAPI client, but they will
  work again when you deselect this option.

  Are you sure you want to set Outlook Express as your Simple MAPI client?

  The Simple MAPI client has been changed. You may need to restart your
  computer for this change to take effect.
