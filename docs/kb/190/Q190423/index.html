-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
- Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.5 
- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you migrate users and messages from a Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
postoffice, it may appear that some recent messages were not migrated.

CAUSE
=====

When you migrate users and messages from an MS Mail (PC) postoffice, messages
contained in the mail message file (MMF) or the Inbox on the postoffice are
migrated to Microsoft Exchange Server. New messages that are delivered to the
recipient after the migration is performed remain on the MS Mail (PC)
postoffice.

WORKAROUND
==========

To move new messages that were delivered after the migration to Exchange Server
was performed, use one of the following methods.

NOTE: If the recipient's mailbox has been deleted from the MS Mail (PC)
postoffice, you must restore a backup of the postoffice to a separate folder
before you perform one of the following procedures. After you restore a backup
of the postoffice, have the recipient connect to the restored postoffice in the
following procedures.

- Have the recipient connect to the MS Mail (PC) postoffice using Mail for
  Windows, and then check for new messages. Then, do one of the following:

   - Perform the migration again.

   - Use a Microsoft Exchange client to import the MMF that contains the new
     messages.

- Have the recipient connect to the MS Mail (PC) postoffice using the MS Mail
  (PC) MS-DOS client and then forward all new messages to his or her Exchange
  Server mailbox. To transfer messages between an MS Mail (PC) postoffice and
  an Exchange Server postoffice, the appropriate transport agents must be
  installed and functioning properly.

- Have the recipient connect to the MS Mail (PC) postoffice using a Microsoft
  Exchange client with the Microsoft Mail information service installed, and
  then check for new messages. The messages are then transferred to the
  recipient's mailbox on the Exchange Server computer or to a set of personal
  folders.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you send a new message to an MS Mail (PC) recipient, the message is stored
on the postoffice until the recipient starts Mail for Windows and then checks
for new messages. The message is then transferred to the recipient's MMF. If you
migrate users and messages from the MS Mail (PC) postoffice after the message
has been received, the message is migrated to the Exchange Server computer
regardless of whether the message has been transferred to the MMF. However, if
the mailbox remains on the postoffice after the migration is performed, new
messages may still be delivered to the recipient. These messages remain on the
MS Mail (PC) postoffice and are not automatically migrated to Exchange Server.

For additional information, please see the migration documentation located in the
Migrate\Docs folder on the Exchange Server 4.0 CD-ROM.
