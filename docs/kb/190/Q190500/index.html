-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

The Exchange Server computer may be unable to receive any X.25 incoming calls if
there is call facilities data in the call packet.

For example, an Eicon trace shows the following:

  37    000-15:43:51.112 RX CALL IND                    &lt;10 01 0B&gt;
   Data =  20
        5A 11 69 00 02 03 13 11 10 06 42 07 07 43 04 04  Z.i.......B..C..
        03 01 01 00                                      ....
  38    000-15:43:51.702 TX CALL ACC                    &lt;10 01 0F&gt;
   Data =  10
        5A 11 69 00 02 03 13 11 10 00                    Z.i.......
  39    000-15:43:51.703 RX CLEAR IND                   &lt;10 01 13&gt;
   Data =   2
        00 42                                            .B
  40    000-15:43:51.993 TX CLEAR CNF                   &lt;10 01 17&gt;
   Data =   0

In this trace, the facilities are 420707430404.

- The former digit 06 is the length of the facilities field.

- The fields by themselves have to be split into Code-Byte 1-Byte 2.

  The first field means packet size = 128 (42 is packet size code, so the first
  digit is for remote DTE and the second is for local DTE. In this case, 7
  indicates a packet size of 128 bytes).

  The second field means window size = 4 (interpreted in the same way as packet
  size).

- In the CLEAR Packet, the code is 42 (facility parameter not allowed).

CAUSE
=====

The incoming call is accepted by the Exchange Server computer because the
facilities in the CALL packet match the facilities set in the X.400 stack, but
the calling side drops the connection when it does not see the facilities in the
CALL ACCEPT packet.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

- Do not use Call Facilities data.

- Obtain the following fix.

- Wait for the next Exchange Server service pack.

To use the fix or the service pack, you must add a new registry value.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services
  \MSExchangeMTA\Parameters

  NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry
  value:

       Value Name: Use incoming facilities on accept
       Data Type:  REG_DWORD
       Value:       1

4. Quit Registry Editor.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
