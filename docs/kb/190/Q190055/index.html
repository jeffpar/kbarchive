SUMMARY
=======

General Manager is a program included with Baseball 3D that you can use to
modify team rosters and edit, create, and delete players in the season database
for Baseball 3D.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To use General Manager to modify a season database file, follow these steps:

1. Quit Baseball 3D if it is running.

2. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Microsoft Games, point to Baseball
  3D, and then click General Manager.

3. Click Open.

4. Click the season database file you want to modify, and then click Open. The
  default season database file is the Currentseason.dat file.

  NOTE: To modify the season database file during a season, click the current
  season database file. For the best results, we recommend you modify the
  season database file before you start a new season.

5. Make any of the following changes you want in the Baseball 3D season database
  file:

   - Trade players
   - Pick up free agents
   - Release players
   - Edit players
   - Create players
   - Modify default team lineups

  NOTE: General Manager does not allow you to save changes in a season database
  file unless all team rosters contain exactly 25 players.

6. Click Save.

7. In the File Name box, type a new file name for your season database, and then
  click Save. The file name must use the following format

  &lt;name&gt;season.dat

  where &lt;name&gt; is any name you want to use.

  NOTE: You should save the modified season database to a new file name. If you
  save the changes to the Currentseason.dat file, General Manager overwrites
  the default season database, and you must reinstall Baseball 3D to restore
  the original default season database.

8. Click Close.

To use your modified season database in a new season or in a single game, follow
these steps:

1. On the Options menu, click Start New Season.

2. When you are prompted to overwrite your current season, click Yes.

3. In the league configuration dialog box, click the Left Arrow (&lt;) or Right
  Arrow (&gt;) button to select the season database you want to use, and then
  click OK.

4. Click Single Game or Season to start a game that includes your database
  changes.
