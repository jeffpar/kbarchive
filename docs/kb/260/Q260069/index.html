-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A malformed HTR request may cause the source code of the Active Server Pages
(ASP) script file to be returned.


CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs because the CreateFile function that is used to open
requested files deletes all of the trailing spaces in a file name. The file-name
truncation in the CreateFile function causes the two names
"C:\Ineptub\Wwroot\Default.asp" and "C:\Ineptub\Wwroot\Default.asp&lt;followed
by several blank spaces&gt;" to be the same, which causes the source code of the
Default.asp file to be opened and be returned.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows 2000. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
