SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to import pushpins from previous versions of
Microsoft Expedia Streets and Trips into Microsoft MapPoint 2001 or Microsoft
Streets and Trips 2001.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To import pushpins into MapPoint 2001 or Streets and Trips 2001, use the
appropriate method to export the pushpins from the previous version of the
program, and then import the pushpins into MapPoint 2001 or Streets and Trips
2001.

NOTE: You cannot export pushpins from Microsoft MapPoint 2000.

Export Pushpins from Microsoft Expedia Streets 98 or Microsoft Expedia Trip Planner 98
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You cannot directly import pushpins that were created in Expedia Streets 98 or
Expedia Trip Planner 98 into MapPoint 2001 or Streets and Trips 2001.

If you have Streets &amp; Trips 2000, then use the Pushpin Conversion tool to
convert pushpins from the Expedia Streets 98 or Expedia Trip Planner 98 format
to the format used by Expedia Streets and Trips 2000.

You can only use the Pushpin Conversion tool if you have Streets &amp; Trips 2000
installed.

The Pushpin Conversion tool converts Expedia Streets 98 or Expedia Trip Planner
98 pushpin files to Streets and Trips 2000 pushpin files that you can import
into MapPoint 2001 or Streets and Trips 2001.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  PushpinConversionTool.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/expediastreets98/Utility/1.0/W9XNT4/EN-US/PushpinConversionTool.exe)

Release Date: Jun-29-1999

Streets and Trips 2001.

Import Pushpins into MapPoint 2001 or Streets and Trips 2001
------------------------------------------------------------

To import pushpins into MapPoint 2001 or Streets and Trips 2001:

and Trips 2001. These programs now save pushpins in a map file. To save imported
pushpins in MapPoint 2001 and Streets and Trips 2001, save the map that contains
the imported pushpins. To use the imported pushpins at a later time, open the
map that contains them.
