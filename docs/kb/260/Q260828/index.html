-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Software installations requiring an automated logon process fail when run under
Systems Management Server version 2.0. Applications such as Microsoft Office
2000 SR1, deployed with Windows Installer MSI files that use automatic logon,
cannot be deployed by Systems Management Server.

CAUSE
=====

Automatic logon is a feature in Microsoft Windows NT, and Microsoft Windows 2000
that allows the automated logon of a specified user ID and password, when the
currently-logged on user is logged off or the system is restarted. This can be
executed at kiosk workstations where the workstation is "locked down" to prevent
unauthorized access.

Systems Management Server version 2.0 has an option for software distribution,
allowing a Systems Management Server program to restart a computer at the end of
an installation. This is done by going to the Program properties, and then, on
the General tab, selecting the Restarts Computer option for a package in the
After Running: drop-down box.

When deploying software with System Management Server with Windows Installer MSI
file for applications such as Office 2000 SR1, Setup performs its pre-restart
actions and writes entries to the run-once key for the post-restart processing.

During the software installation process, Systems Management Server logs off the
currently-logged-on user. The automatic logon feature allows a logon to occur
immediately thereafter. This initiates the run-once process of the application.
At the same time, Systems Management Server executes the Restart Computer
command, which restarts the system and terminates the run-once processing. After
restarting, the application is left in an unknown state.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do not use the automatic logon feature for software installations where Systems
Management Server is used to restart the computer after the installation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
