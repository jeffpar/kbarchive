-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Disk Administrator tool to create a volume set from an existing
NTFS partition or to extend an existing NTFS volume set, Windows NT 4.0 requires
that the computer be rebooted so that Chkdsk (Autochk.exe) can be run.

CAUSE
=====

This requirement is caused by the design of the volume-extension routine.
Because Chkdsk contains code to correct NTFS volumes that are incorrectly sized,
Disk Administrator does not perform all the work in adjusting the size of the
NTFS volume. Instead, Disk Administrator modifies the partition table
information and some key header information for the NTFS volume, and then starts
Chkdsk so that Chkdsk can adjust internal NTFS tables that must be resized.

This method of resizing volumes works well but results in otherwise unnecessary
downtime for the computer, particularly if the volume that you are extending
contains many files.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT 4.0 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date        Time     Size    File name       Platform
  -----------------------------------------------------
  03/14/2000  06:36p   430,864   Autochk.exe   Intel
  03/14/2000  07:00p   375,056   Kernel32.dll  Intel
  03/14/2000  06:39p   368,464   Ntfs.sys      Intel
  03/14/2000  06:36p   663,312   Autochk.exe   Alpha
  03/14/2000  07:00p   589,584   Kernel32.dll  Alpha
  03/14/2000  06:38p   561,808   Ntfs.sys      Alpha



NOTE: In order to avoid a full scan during autochk, it is also necessary to edit
the system registry as follows:

Ensure that a value named "NtfsEnableVolumeExtension" exists under:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem

The value should be a REG_DWORD and its data should be 0x1 to avoid the full
scan.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Resizing an NTFS volume involves less work for Chkdsk than validating that an
NTFS volume is completely correct (or "clean"). A reboot is still required for
the resizing process after you install the updated files from the hotfix that is
described in this article; however, if the volume is not marked "dirty" for any
reason, the volume extension takes place without requiring the full three-pass
scan of the volume that Autochk.exe typically performs. This typically takes no
more than a few seconds.
