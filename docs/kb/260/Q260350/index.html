SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Exchange Server routing objects have six intrinsic actions:

- AndSplit
- Goto
- New
- OrSplit
- Wait
- Terminate

A Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) document describes the Wait action as
follows:

  

  Action     Parameter        Description
  Wait       Time as Long     Wait the specified number of minutes; then 
                           execute the next row.

Some of the examples include the following parameter:

  Wait 0   0

What does this example mean? Does it mean that the routing process does not wait
and immediately executes the next row of the routing map?

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MSDN document does not clearly state what Wait action really does. The
parameter

  Wait 0   0

means that the routing process waits for a certain time based on the existing
"waiting time." The waiting time depends on the following items:

- The amount of time that was previously used for Wait action.

- The time interval that is specified in the Time Scheduled Event.

For example, if you set the time interval for 15 minutes from the Scheduled
Event, and you have the following routing map:

  ......
  1010   Wait          0     10080   
  1012   Goto          0     1020
  1014   Wait          0     0 
  2000   DoSomething   2            
  ......

the second Wait action uses the existing time (15 minutes that is set from the
Scheduled Event) and the 10,080 minutes that is used by the first Wait action.
As the result, DoSomething action in the above map is not executed until either
the timeout expires (10,080 minutes) or it receives the "Approved/Rejected"
message.
