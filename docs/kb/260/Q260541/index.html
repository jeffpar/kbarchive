-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Removing site boundaries from a site without disabling the Modify User Logon
Scripts setting at the site does not ensure that all Systems Management Server
(SMS) 2.0 files are removed from the clients. The client is uninstalled from the
site, but retains some common base SMS client files if it logs on to the network
after being uninstalled.

CAUSE
=====

SMS uninstalls the client components when site boundaries are removed. However,
because the the Modify User Logon Scripts setting is still enabled for Windows
Networking Logon Client Installation or Windows Networking Logon Discovery, the
client runs the SMS logon script the next time a user logs on. Therefore, the
client receives some of the base component files to assess site assignment.
Because there are no boundaries for the site, however, the assignment does not
succeed. This leaves behind the common files that were copied to the client.

WORKAROUND
==========

Disable the Modify User Logon Scripts setting in Windows Networking Logon Client
Installation or Windows Networking Logon Discovery before you remove site
boundaries, or wait until all users have logged on to the network before
removing the site boundaries.

If the files exist on a client workstation after you have removed the site
boundaries and did not disable the Modify User Logon Scripts option, remove the
files manually by running Cliunins.exe or 20clicln.bat, or reassign the client
to another site and then uninstall it by running "smsman /u" from the
Smslogon\X86.bin\00000409 folder.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following files may remain on client workstations in the MS\SMS\Core\Bin
folder after the logon script is run, even though no valid site boundaries exist
for the client workstation:

  Abnwcli.dll
  Bindclin.dll
  Boot32wn.exe
  Clibase.dll
  Clicore.exe
  Cliex32.dll
  Clilog.dll
