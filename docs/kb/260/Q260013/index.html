The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When users attempt to view free and busy time for users in another site, they
may only see hash marks for those users on the Attendee Availability tab, for
example:

  Username \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

CAUSE
=====

Free and busy replication has not been configured to replicate across all sites.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the Exchange Administrator program, follow these steps to configure free and
busy replication:

1. Locate the Schedule+ Free Busy folder. To do this, click the Organization
  Level, click Folders, click System Folders, and then click Schedule+ Free
  Busy folder. This displays all free and busy folders for each site within the
  organization.

2. Open the properties for the local site.

3. On the Replicas tab, include the other sites in the Replicate Folders To
  pane.

After the replication procedure is finished, all users can view free and busy
information across all sites.
