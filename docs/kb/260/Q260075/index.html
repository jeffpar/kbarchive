- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you call a Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) component from a
non-Microsoft Transaction Server component that is

- running under Microsoft Active Server Pages (ASP)

-and-

- written in Microsoft Visual Basic

then your server may stop responding to ASP requests when it is placed under
stress.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can happen if the calling component creates the second component
through the use of CreateObject, instead of through the object context's
CreateInstance method.

A call to Server.CreateObject always creates an MTS thread with a context
wrapper. Therefore, the first object is created on an MTS thread and ends up
creating a second object, which is an MTS object. CreateInstance should be used
when you create an MTS object from an object in Microsoft Transaction Server.

Another way to avoid this problem is to configure the calling component into an
MTS server package so that it will start in a different process than if it were
created in Inetinfo.exe's process space.

RESOLUTION
==========

Because the calling component is running under ASP, it has access to all of the
ASP properties and methods. Instead of creating the component using
CreateObject, you can use the CreateInstance property of the ObjectContext
object. For an example of how to accomplish this, see the example in the "More
Information" section.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

================


Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new ActiveX DLL project in Visual Basic.

2. Rename the project from "Project1" to "NotAnMTSComponent" (without the
  quotation marks).

3. Rename "Class1" to "CNotAnMTSComponent" (without the quotation marks).

4. Paste the following code into cNotAnMTSComponent:

  Option Explicit

  Public Sub Test()

      Dim x As Object
      
      Set x = CreateObject("MyMTSComponent.cMTSComponent")
      x.DoSomething
      Set x = Nothing
      
      
  End Sub

5. From the Visual Basic File menu, select Add Project, and create a new ActiveX
  DLL.

6. Rename the project from "Project1" to "MyMTSComponent" (without the quotation
  marks).

7. Rename "Class1" to "cMTSComponent" (without the quotation marks).

8. Set the MTSTransactionMode of cMTSComponent to 2 - Requires Transaction.

9. From the Project menu, select References, and add a reference to "Microsoft
  Transaction Server Type Library" (without the quotation marks).

10. Paste the following code into cMTSComponent:

  Option Explicit

  Public Sub DoSomething()

      Dim oc As ObjectContext
      Dim x  As Integer
      Dim strNothing As String
      
      
      Set oc = GetObjectContext
      
      'Waste some time here
      For x = 1 To 1000
          strNothing = strNothing + String(1000 * Rnd() + 1, " ")
      Next x
          
      
      oc.SetComplete
      Set oc = Nothing
      

  End Sub

11. Compile both .dll files.

12. Use your MTS Explorer to create a new package, and then add
  MyMTSComponent.dll to the package.

13. Create an ASP page named "Test.asp" (without the quotation marks). Paste the
  following code into it:

  <span class="nt">&lt;</span><span class="err">%@</span> <span class="na">LANGUAGE =</span><span class="err"> </span><span class="s">VBScript</span> <span class="err">%</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;html&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;body&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;</span><span class="err">%</span>
       <span class="na">dim</span> <span class="na">myObj</span>
       <span class="na">set</span> <span class="na">myObj =</span><span class="err"> </span><span class="s">SErver.CreateObject("NotAnMTSComponent.cNotAnMTSComponent")</span>

  <span class="err">%</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>

  Done!
  <span class="nt">&lt;/body&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>

14. Use the Internet Services Manager to create a new application. Make its path
  C:\Inetpub\Wwwroot\Test. (Modify the path as necessary to suit your Internet
  Information Services [IIS] setup.) Ensure that the application is running in
  a separate process. Name the application "Test" (without the quotation
  marks).

15. Put Test.asp into C:\Inetpub\Wwwroot\Test.

16. Use a Web application stress tool (for example,
  http://webtool.rte.microsoft.com/) to apply a load to your Web site. Your
  application should stop responding ("hang").

To solve the problem, change the code in cNotAnMTSComponent to:

  Option Explicit

  Public Sub Test()

      Dim x As Object
      Dim oc as ObjectContext

      Set oc = GetObjectContext
      Set x = oc.CreateInstance("MyMTSComponent.cMTSComponent")
      x.DoSomething
      Set x = Nothing
      set oc = nothing
      
  End Sub
