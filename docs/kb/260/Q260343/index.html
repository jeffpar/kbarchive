The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send an e-mail message across an Exchange Server site connector and
request a delivery receipt, the delivery receipt is returned with the entire
contents of the message. The entire contents of the message are returned back to
the last message transfer agent (MTA). At this point the contents are stripped
from the delivery receipt, and only the delivery receipt is sent to the sender.
If a large number of messages that contain large attachments, for example, 10
megabytes (MB) or larger, are sent across the site connector, MTA performance
may slow.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, replace the site connector with an X.400 connector.
If you use an X.400 connector you can set the ContentReturnRequest flag to false
by changing the heuristic bits. For additional information about how to set the
ContentReturnRequest flag to false, click the article number below to view the
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q151413 XCON: ContentReturn Requested by Default

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, the Exchange Server MTA sets ContentReturnRequest flags to true for
all messages that travel across the site connector, which requests the return of
the entire content of the messages.

The PerMessageFlag of a message that the Exchange Server MTA sends is always
constructed with the ContentReturnRequest field set to true. Therefore, any
delivery receipt contains the content of the original message. You cannot
configure the construction of the ContentReturnRequest field by using the
Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program or by using the client software
for the messages that travel across the site connector.
