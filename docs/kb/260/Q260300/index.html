SUMMARY
=======

When you view the application log of a Microsoft Exchange Server, the user may
receive the following event:

  Event ID: 183
  Source: ESE97
  Type: Information
  Category: Online Defragmentation
  Description: MSExchangeIS ((198)) Online defragmentation of database
  'C:\exchsrvr\MDBDATA\PRIV.EDB' was interrupted and terminated. The next time
  online defragmentation is started on this database, it will resume from the
  point of interruption.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Exchange Server online defragmentation against the information store databases
starts immediately after information store maintenance tasks have been
completed. By default, the online defragmentation process runs for a minimum of
fifteen minutes and it only runs for up to one hour after the information store
maintenance scheduled window time.

This is a low priority task, and if the task is interrupted by another task that
requires access to the database (commonly an online backup), the server logs
event 183.

The user may want to schedule the Exchange Server Information Store (IS)
Maintenance and the backups for different times during off-peak hours. This
allows more time for the online defragmentation to take place. To change the IS
Maintenance schedule:

1. Start the Exchange Administrator program.

2. Expand the left pane until you see the server name of the Exchange server on
  which you want to change the IS Maintenance schedule.

3. Click the server name, and then click Properties on the File menu.

4. On the IS Maintenance tab, click the schedule that you want, click Apply, and
  then click OK.
