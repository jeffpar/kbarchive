-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Research In Motion Limited (RIM) BlackBerry Enterprise Server,
a two-way text paging software, on an Exchange Server-based computer, the Auto
Naming generation rules (on the Tools menu, click Options, and then click Auto
Naming) in the Exchange Administration program are changed and any new
recipients are created with the display name and alias name in the wrong
format.

For example, the Auto Naming feature for display name generation may have
originally been set to "Last, First (Smith, John)" which shows as "%Last,
%First" in the "Custom" section. After you install the BlackBerry Enterprise
Server, the same generation type, "Last, First (Smith, John), is selected in the
Administration program, but the "Custom" section defaults to "%First %Last" for
display name, and "%First%1Last" for the alias name. All new recipients use this
"custom" format to generate display and alias names.

CAUSE
=====

The Auto Naming generation information is not server-specific. This information
is set in a user's Microsoft Windows NT profile, the Ntuser.dat file. The
Ntuser.dat file is started as a registry hive called HKEY_CURRENT_USER every
time that a user logs on to a Windows NT computer.

After you install the BlackBerry Enterprise Server and you start the Exchange
Administration program against a server in the site where BlackBerry Enterprise
Server is installed, the following registry values are modified in the user's
profile or registry:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Exchange

  Values:
  ANGAutotextFormat
  DNGAutotextFormat

The "ANG" acronym stands for Alias Name Generation and the "DNG" acronym stands
for Display Name Generation. This change only occurs the first time that you
start the Exchange Administration program against the server after you install
BlackBerry Enterprise Server. Also, if you start the Administration program
against another server in the site other than the server where you installed
BlackBerry Enterprise Server, you must replicate the BlackBerry Enterprise
Server extensions to the Site\Configuration\Add-Ins container on that server
before the problem occurs. The names of these extensions are BBMailboxExt and
BBServerExt.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, change the Auto Naming generation feature back to the
previous setting. This must be performed on each computer on which you have
started the Exchange Administrator program against one of the servers in the
site.
