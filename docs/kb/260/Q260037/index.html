SUMMARY
=======

In some cases, you may need to remove a single message from an Exchange Server
computer. This article describes how to remove a single message by using the
ExMerge utility.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The steps in this article require the ExMerge disaster recovery utility version
3.62 or later. Please contact Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS) to obtain
the latest version of ExMerge.

1. Log on to the Exchange service account.

2. Create a folder called "Exmerge" (without quotation marks) on the Exchange
  Server computer.

3. Copy the following files to the folder:

  Exmerge.exe
  Exmerge.ini
  Mfc42.dll

4. Double-click the Exmerge.exe file, read the Welcome message, and then click
  Next.

5. Click "Two step merge", and then click Next.

6. Click "Step 1: Copy data to Personal Folders", and then click Next.

7. Type your server name, and then click Options.

8. On the Data tab, click "User messages".

9. On the Import Procedure tab, click "Archive data to target store". This
  copies the data that you select to .pst files, and then deletes the data in
  the Exchange Server mailbox.

10. Click Yes when you receive the warning message.

11. On the Message Details tab, type the subject of the message or the
  attachment name that you want to remove, click Add, click Apply, and then
  click OK.

NOTE: If the original message was forwarded with a different subject, the ExMerge
utility cannot delete the message based on the original message subject line or
MTS-ID.

If the Item Retention option is turned on, the message may be available for
recovery on the Outlook client. For additional information about deleted item
recovery, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q228934 XCLN: Understanding Deleted Item Recovery

12. On the Dates tab you can select a specific date or range of dates or times
  to narrow your search.

  Note that all dates and times are selected by default.

13. Select all mailboxes or only the affected mailboxes, and then check Next.

14. If possible, leave the default folder as C:\Exmergedata, and then click
  Next

  NOTE: Microsoft does not recommend that you change the default folder, but it
  may be necessary to select a different location due to free space
  limitations.

  The ExMerge utility pulls the e-mail messages that you selected from the
  mailboxes to .pst files.

15. Open a few mailboxes to make sure that the message was removed.

  Note that the messages are not removed from the System Attendant Mailbox as a
  safety measure. You must manually delete these messages.

16. After you determine that the message is removed from all mailboxes, you can
  delete the .pst files in the C:\Exmergedata folder.
