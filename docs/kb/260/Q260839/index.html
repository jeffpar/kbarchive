-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Directory replication may not finish if the Defense Message System (DMS) Active
Directory Connector (ADC) is installed. Any computer that is running Exchange
Server 5.5 Service Pack 2 or Service Pack 3 that has the DMS ADC (version
6.0.4116.0) does not replicate the Configuration container-naming context. Other
containers are replicated (for example, any changes to mailboxes replicate).

If you change the directory service logging for replication events to maximum and
you change the internal processing to minimum, the directory service logs the
following events 1171 and 1082 in the application event log:

  Event Type: Error
  Event Source: MSExchangeDS
  Event Category: Internal Processing
  Event ID: 1171
  Description:
  Exception e0010002 has occurred with parameters 9 and 6 (internal ID 3190022).
  Contact Microsoft Technical Support for assistance.

  Event Type: Information
  Event Source: MSExchangeDS
  Event Category: Replication
  Event ID: 1082
  Description:
  Replication warning: The directory replication agent (DRA) couldn't update
  object /o=ORGANIZATION/ou=SiteName/cn=Configuration/cn=Servers/cn=ServerA
  /cn=Synchronization Service (ServerA) with changes made by directory
  EX:/o=ORGANIZATION/ou=SiteName/cn=Configuration/cn=Servers/cn=ServerA
  /cn=Microsoft DSA because of error 9. The directory will try to update the
  object later. If this condition persists, try to free more disk space or stop
  and restart this Microsoft Exchange Server computer.

Note that these events occur on the server that is receiving updates from the
server on which the DMS ADC is installed. No error message events occur on the
server on which the DMS ADC is actually installed.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because when the DMS ADC is installed, it adds several
classes to the schema. Some of these additions are erroneously marked for
replication.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.
