SYMPTOMS
========

When transitioning Client Access Points (CAP) or client connection accounts
within a site, Systems Management Server (SMS) clients may be orphaned.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because within a site, clients use the CAP to check their
assignments and refresh site configuration data. Clients refresh this
information on a set schedule (approximately once a day) or you restart the
computer. If the administrator removes all of the CAPs that a client can use, or
removes the client connection accounts, the clients are not able to connect to a
CAP, and so are not able to send inventory data or receive new advertisements.

If the administrator removes all of the old CAPs and then adds new ones, the
existing clients have the "old" CAP list. Similarly, if the administrator
removes all of the old client connection accounts and then adds new ones, the
clients have the old client connection accounts and are unable to connect to any
CAPs.

If a site has Windows Networking Logon Client Installation enabled, and is
orphaned for one of the previous reasons, they are able to get the new list of
CAPs and connection accounts by authenticating through the SMS Logon Point.
However, for sites that do not have Windows Networking Logon Client Installation
enabled, the clients do not authenticate through the logon point, and are unable
to regain connectivity to the CAP.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue and avoid this situation, gradually transition from
the old CAPs to the new CAPs or from the old client connection accounts to the
new client connection accounts. When you decide how long the transition should
take, consider how long clients in the site can be disconnected from the network
under normal conditions (for example, over the weekend, overnight, or during a
holiday break). During this transition, have both the old and new CAPs or the
old and new client connection accounts enabled, and permit sufficient time for
the clients to update their configuration with the new CAP list or client
connection account list. After the clients have received the updates, remove the
old CAPs or client connection accounts.
