SYMPTOMS
========

When the message transfer agent (MTA) attempts to move mail between postoffices,
you may receive the following error message:

  A Critical Error has occurred Error Code=19FE Device Error=000D

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the MTA attempts to modify a file and cannot.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. Determine which file is the problem file:

  a. In the session log, find the error message.

  b. One line above the error, the drive that the error occurred on and the
     file that the MTA was attempting to modify should be displayed. If the
     error is not displayed or there is no logging, stop the MTA.

  c. Turn up logging by adding -q135z -v and -l.

  d. Start the MTA and let it run until the error occurs again.

  e. Stop the MTA and open the log.

  f. Find the error message. Above the error message, the file that the MTA was
     trying to open is displayed.

2. Try to rename the problem file to see if the file is corrupted or locked
  open. If you can rename the file, the file is corrupted and needs to be
  replaced or repaired, depending on the file. If the file is locked, you need
  to break the lock.

3. After you complete step 2, restart the MTA and make sure that the error
  message is gone.

4. If the error message does not reoccur, stop the MTA and remove the additional
  logging to prevent the session log from growing to large.
