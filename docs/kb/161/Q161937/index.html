SYMPTOMS
========

The Internet Mail Connector (IMC) stops processing outbound messages. If the IMC
is not running, any attempts to start the IMC fail with an event 10.67. No other
events are logged. DEC Alpha platforms seem to be susceptible to this problem.
Use of Mdbvu32 will show messages sitting in the MTS-OUT folder.

CAUSE
=====

The attachment to the message has been corrupted at some point. The
PR_ATTACHMENT_ENCODING is obtained from the Winmail.dat because the message was
sent in TNEF but the actual attachment consists of only the data fork because
the resource fork has been stripped. Imail processes the attachment as
MAC_BINARY and reads the first 128 bytes of the header and incorrectly
determines the filename length. The erroneous filename length leads to
corruption of memory and an eventual crash of the IMC.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

- Use the resource kit utility Imcsave to remove the messages and save the
  contents of the MTS-OUT folder.

  -or-

- Use Mdbvu32 to copy messages out of the MTS-OUT folder. Remove the first
  message and try to start the IMC.

In both cases, the IMC should work once the problem message has been removed.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange version 4.00.
This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word
