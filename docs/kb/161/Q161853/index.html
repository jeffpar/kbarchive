-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to check the spelling of a document in Creative Writer version
2.0, you may receive the following error message:

  Creative Writer had trouble spell checking your document. Something may be
  broken in the spell checker.

  Please re-install Creative Writer by running Setup from the Creative Writer
  CD.

Following the instructions in the error box may not resolve the problem.

CAUSE
=====

The files used for checking the spelling may be damaged or missing.

RESOLUTION
==========

Rename the following files using the steps below:

  Mssp232.dll
  Mssp2_en.lex (The letters, "en" may be something else if this is not a U.S.
  English version of Creative Writer 2.0.)

1. Double-click the My Computer icon on your desktop.

2. Double-click your C: drive. (This assumes that C: is the letter of the hard
  drive where Creative Writer is installed.)

3. Double-click the Program Files folder.

4. Double-click the Common Files folder.

5. Double-click the Microsoft Shared folder.

6. Double-click the Proof folder.

7. Click once on the Mssp232.dll file, and then click Rename on the File menu.

8. Rename the file to mssp232.old.

9. Repeat steps 7 and 8 for Mssp2_en.lex file, and rename it to Mssp2_en.old.

10. Reinstall Creative Writer 2.0.

  a. Put the Creative Writer 2.0 compact disc in the CD-ROM drive, while
     holding down the SHIFT key (this will prevent the program from starting
     automatically).

  b. Click the Start button, then click Run.

  c. Type "d:\setup" (without the quotation marks), where d: is the drive
     letter of your CD ROM drive.

  d. Click the Setup Again button.

11. Run Creative Writer.

After following the steps listed above, Creative Writer should check the spelling
of your document correctly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: This article assumes that Regional Settings in Control Panel is set to
English (United States). If the regional setting is a different English version,
such as English (British), this information still applies. However, you may need
to substitute any references to the American English dictionary file
(Mssp_am.lex) with the British English dictionary file (Mssp_br.lex) in the
discussion below.

When you install a Microsoft program and include the spelling checker, the Setup
program copies a spelling engine file (.dll) and a dictionary file (.lex) to a
common folder on your computer:

  C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft\Shared\Proof

This folder may contain two versions of the spelling checker because Microsoft
programs can install different spelling engines and Dictionary files. For
example, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Publisher, and Microsoft Office install the
following spelling checker files:

  Engine: Mssp232.dll
  Dictionary: Mssp2_en.lex

Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Project, Microsoft PowerPoint, and Microsoft Access
install these different spelling checker files:

  Engine: Mssp32.dll
  Dictionary: Mssp_am.lex

To have two versions of the spelling checker usually does not cause a problem
because the Windows Registry keeps track of only one main engine and dictionary.
The Registry stores a Spelling key with an Engine value and a Dictionary value
under the following entry:

  
  [\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\Shared Tools\Proofing
  Tools\Spelling\1033\Normal]

If the spelling checker in Microsoft Word (the same spelling checker that is also
included with Microsoft Office and Microsoft Publisher) is installed at the time
you set up other Microsoft programs, then the Registry's Engine and Dictionary
values are not changed. This enables other Microsoft programs to use the
Microsoft Word spelling engine (Mssp232.dll) and dictionary (Mssp2_en.lex)
because they are more robust than the other spelling engine and dictionary
(Mssp32.dll and Mssp_am.lex).
