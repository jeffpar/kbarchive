-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you view Full Screen (on the View menu, click Full Screen), the Full Screen
toolbar is missing.

CAUSE
=====

By design, Word does not provide a menu command to turn off the Full Screen
toolbar. The only way to hide the Full Screen toolbar is to run a Visual Basic
for Applications command.

If the Full Screen toolbar is hidden, you may have a macro or add-in that has set
the visible property for the Full Screen toolbar to False.

WORKAROUND

support professionals can help explain the functionality of a particular
procedure, but they will not modify these examples to provide added

If you are in Full Screen view and the Full Screen toolbar is not appearing, you
can use the following methods to return from Full Screen view or to redisplay
the Full Screen toolbar.

Method 1: To Return from Full Screen View
-----------------------------------------

1. Press the ESC key on your keyboard.

  -or-

  Press ALT+V+U.

  -or-

2. Press ALT+T+M+M.

3. In the Macro Name box, type "ToggleFull" (without the quotation marks).

4. Click Run.

If this does not work, it is possible that the ToggleFull macro has been altered
from its default functionality.

The following steps will restore the ToggleFull macro functionality:

IMPORTANT: These steps involve deleting a macro. If you are unsure as to the
source of the macro in question, you may want to investigate the source before
proceeding. For example, if you are part of an administrative group in a network
environment, check with your network administrator prior to deleting this
macro.

1. On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Macros.

2. From the "Macros in" box, select "All active templates and documents." If
  ToggleFull appears as an available macro in the list of macros, select it.

3. Click Delete.

Method 2: To Redisplay the Full Screen Toolbar
----------------------------------------------

The following Visual Basic for Applications macro will redisplay the Full Screen
toolbar.

     Sub ShowFullScrToolBar()
        If ActiveWindow.View.FullScreen Then
           CommandBars("full screen").Visible = True
        End If
     End Sub

NOTE: Before you run this macro, you must be in Full Screen view.

To run this macro while in Full Screen view, follow these steps:

1. Press ALT+T+M+M.

2. In the Macro Name box, type "ShowFullScrToolBar" (without the quotation
  marks).

3. Click OK.
