SUMMARY
=======

After you set permissions on specific files, users and groups sometimes have
more rights to the files than expected. This is because NTFS security applies
both at the file level and at the folder level. NTFS permissions granted at both
levels are cumulative.

For example, you have a folder called Reports and you grant the group Sales full
control, and the group Marketing read access to the folder. You then put a file
called README into the folder, and explicitly set the rights to the Everyone
group as Read. Members of the Marketing group will be able to read, but not
delete the file README. Members of the Sales group however, will be able to both
read and delete the file, because they have the full control right at the folder
level. To prevent the file from being deleted by either group you would need to
change the Sales group access at the folder level.
