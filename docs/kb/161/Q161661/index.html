SUMMARY
=======

This article contains a sample Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications macro
(Sub procedure) that copies all slides, as PowerPoint objects, from your active
presentation to another presentation. If you have one presentation open, the
macro creates and then adds the slides to the new presentation. If you have two
presentations open, the macro appends the slides to the end of the second
presentation.
