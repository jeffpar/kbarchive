IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the IBM SDLC link service on an IBM PC Server 320 or 350, SNA
Server Setup fails to detect the IBM SDLC Multifunction adapter /A
(Microchannel) adapter. If you ignore this error, Setup adds the SDLC link
service, but the link service remains pending and will not activate.

CAUSE
=====

When detecting the IBM MPA/A adapter, SNA Server Setup only looks for the first
hardware bus record in the Windows NT registry. However, these servers have both
a PCI and an MCA bus. The first bus is identified as PCI, so this fails to match
the expected MCA entry.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, either apply the fix referenced below (see "STATUS") or
use the following workaround:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe or Regedit.exe, as appropriate for your
  version of Windows NT).

2. Go to the following key in the registry:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\HARDWARE\DESCRIPTION\System\MultifunctionAdapter\0

3. Change the Identifier value from PCI to MCA, as follows:

  Identifier: REG_SZ: MCA

4. Quit Registry Editor.

5. Re-run the SNA Server Setup program. Do NOT restart the computer first;
  Windows NT dynamically sets this registry value when starting and will change
  it back to PCI.

Setting the value to MCA allows the Setup program to detect the adapter and
configure the correct CardCfg entries for the adapter. The SDLC link service
will continue to function even after the computer is restarted.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.11, 2.11
Service Pack 1 (SP1), and 2.11 SP2. A supported fix is now available. Contact
Microsoft Technical Support for more information.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

  S E R V P A C K


MORE INFORMATION
================

A fix for this problem is available from Microsoft for both 2.11 and 3.0. With
the fix applied, the Sync card detection module (syncdtct.dll) loops through all
NetworkCard registry keys.

IBM PC Server 320 and 350 are manufactured by IBM, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
