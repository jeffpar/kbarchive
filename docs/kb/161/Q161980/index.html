SUMMARY
=======

The following article contains a copy of the complete text of the Readme.wri
file that comes with version 1.0 of Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Starts
Here.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Readme.wri File
---------------

Microsoft(R) Windows NT(R) Workstation 4.0 Starts Here(TM)
Version 4.0 Readme.wri

Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Starts Here is an interactive
multimedia training tool that provides just-in-time training for
Microsoft Windows NT Workstation, combining the best of proven
learning techniques from print-based, video-based, and instructor-led
training methods. Starts Here helps upgraders and new users master
Windows NT Workstation 4.0 as quickly and easily as possible.

System Requirements:
--------------------

Multimedia PC with a 486/33DX or higher processor
Microsoft Windows NT Workstation Version 4.0 (16 MB RAM)
12 MB of available hard disk space
Double-speed CD-ROM drive
Super VGA display with 256 colors or better
Microsoft Mouse or compatible pointing device
Windows NT-compatible sound board and headphones or speakers

Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Installation Tips:
-------------------------------------------------------

Starts Here assumes that Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 4.0 is
properly installed on your computer.  Here are some things to check
to ensure that Starts Here will function properly:

Users have at least minimum User privileges.
One lesson requires Power User privileges.

If you need to print the lessons/documents, you must be connected
to a printer. You may notice improper page layout on some dot matrix
printers.

Setup:
------

Autorun may not work on some CD changers.
After Starts Here is installed, ActiveMovie(TM) is automatically
installed.
Administrator privileges are required for setup on
Windows NT.
The maximum path length for installation is 57 characters.

Re-install option:
------------------

Problem:

The re-install option in setup may be unable to repair a damaged
installation.

Workaround:

1. Remove the damaged installation by running setup from the Starts
  Here CD-ROM.  Select the Remove All option.
2. Re-run setup from the Starts Here CD-ROM to create a new
  installation.

Palette Flashes:
----------------

Problem:

Some videos may cause palette flashes on systems using a 256-color
display mode.

Workaround:

1. Change to high color (16 bit/65536 colors) or higher, or
  Remove the desktop background bitmap.

Banyan Vines Client for Windows NT 4.0 Users:
---------------------------------------------

*** Network installations may fail due to a problem resolving UNC
path names. ***

Problem #1:
An error dialog appears that says that ActiveMovie needs to be installed.
Introduction and lesson videos will not play.

Workaround:

ActiveMovie can be installed manually using the following steps:

1. In Windows NT Explorer or from the command prompt, open the
  network path to the Starts Here setup location.
2. Open the folder \System.
3. Run Amovie.exe.

Problem #2:

Error message on startup: "Either the CD-ROM or your Network is not
available...." The Registry, by default, stores the Media Path as a UNC
\\server\share. The Banyan client for Windows NT 4.0 may be unable to
resolve this.

Workaround:

1. Map a drive letter to the UNC \\server\share.
2. From the Start Menu, run Regedit.
3. Open this pathway:
  "My Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft NT
  Workstation 4.0 Starts Here".
4. Double-click on the key field: "MediaPath".
5. In the "Value Data" field substitute the new drive letter for the
  \\server\share portion of the entry.

--------

Friday, excluding holidays, 6:00AM to 6:00PM, Pacific Time. Call
