IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to start the Microsoft Exchange Server Information Store service,
the following error occurs:

  The Microsoft Exchange Information Store service returned service specific
  error 3355445011.

In the Windows NT Event Log, the following entry may be present:

  Event ID: 1080
  Source: MSExchangeIS
  Type: Error
  Category: Recovery
  Description: Unable to recover the database because error 0xc8000713 occurred
  after a restore operation. Unable to find the file.

Or, the Information Store service may not start and you may receive the service
specific error -939522285.

CAUSE
=====

The above error message occurs when the information store appears to be restored
from an online backup, but the information store files are not restored because
they are damaged or missing. After a restore operation the Restore in Progress
registry key is added to the following key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS

When the Information Store service starts and finds the above registry key, it
assumes a restoration has occurred and that the information store needs to
perform recovery steps. The information store then tries to move forward through
any log files. When the information store has successfully started, this
registry key is deleted. However, if the information store cannot find the
Priv.edb file or Pub.edb file, it cannot move forward through the log files, and
the preceding error message occurs. In this case, the information store does not
create blank EDB files, and the registry key is not deleted.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this behavior, delete the Restore in Progress key from the Registry
Editor in the following location:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS

Start the information store again. If the required EDB files are not found, they
will be re-created. After this is done, try restoring from backup again.
