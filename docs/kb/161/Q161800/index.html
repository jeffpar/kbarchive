-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to install a custom application using Setup disks created with the
Setup Wizard in the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit (ADT) for Windows 95,
you may receive the following error:

  Setup was not completed successfully

CAUSE
=====

This error has different causes, depending on what options you selected in the
ADT Setup Wizard at the time that you created the Setup disks:

- In the Setup Wizard, you added the name of an executable file that will run
  after the Setup program is completed and used the default setting on the
  command line for the executable file. For example, if you add the file
  README.TXT, in the "Run the following file after the custom Setup program is
  completed" box, then the default command line is as follows:

  "$(FilePath)\README.TXT"

- In the Setup Wizard, you added the Replication functionality and specified a
  server name in the "Path to Shared Network Folder" box that does not exist or
  contains a space. For example, you entered a \\server\share path as follows:

  \\My App\Share

- In the Setup Wizard, you added the Replication functionality and specified a
  particular network server in the "Path to Shared Network Folder" box.
  However, when you tried to install the custom application, the computer did
  not have a connection to the particular network server.

- In the Setup Wizard, you added the Replication functionality and specified a
  particular network server in the "Path to Shared Network Folder" box.
  However, adequate permissions have not been set for the individual running
  the custom setup program

.  - In the Setup Wizard, on the screen marked "Add the files that you want your
  custom Setup program to copy and then set properties for each file:", the
  "Set as Workgroup file" check box has been selected for your main application
  file (.mdb).

RESOLUTION
==========

There are five possible workarounds to this error:

- If the cause is that you included an executable file to run after setup
  finishes, then run the Setup Wizard again and specify a complete command line
  for the file. Enclose any files, paths, or strings that might contain spaces
  in quotation marks, for example:

  "$(WinPath)\NOTEPAD.EXE" "$(AppPath)\README.TXT"

- If the cause is an error in the "Path to Shared Network Folder" setting for
  the Replication feature, then run the Setup Wizard again and enter a correct
  server name without spaces, for example:

  \\MyApp\Share

- If the cause is the lack of a connection to a network share for the
  Replication feature, then establish a connection and rerun the Setup program
  for the custom application.

- If the cause is that inadequate permissions have been set for the individual
  running the custom setup program, then have share level permissions of
  read/write/create assigned to this individual before running the custom setup
  program.

- If the cause is that you specified your main application file as your
  workgroup file, then rerun the Setup Wizard and specify a valid workgroup
  file (.mdw). The selected file should store option and security settings for
  your application.

  NOTE: If you do not specify a workgroup information file for your application
  and your application requires one, the Setup Wizard will create this file for
  you.
