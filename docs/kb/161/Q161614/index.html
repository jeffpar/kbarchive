SYMPTOMS
========

If you do not specify a search direction when using the Microsoft Visual Basic
for Applications Find property, the search routine may go to the next instance
of a search string, the previous instance, or nothing happens.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs by design because the search function of Word remembers the
last direction and uses this as the default for the next search.

WORKAROUND
==========

Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without warranty
either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied

article assumes that you are familiar with the programming language being
demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug procedures. Microsoft
support professionals can help explain the functionality of a particular
procedure, but they will not modify these examples to provide added
functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific needs. If you have
limited programming experience, you may want to contact a Microsoft Certified
Partner or the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more

The following Find Object properties determine the search direction and whether
the search continues after you reach the beginning or end of the document:

Forward Argument
----------------

The Forward argument specifies the direction to search. When you set the value to
True, the macro searches toward the end of the document. When you set the value
to False, the macro searches toward the beginning of the document.

Wrap Property
-------------

The Wrap property returns or sets the event that occurs when the search begins at
a point other than the beginning of the document or if the search text is not
found in the specified selection or range. The Wrap property can use any of the
following WdFindWrap constants:

Constant         Description
--------         -----------

wdFindAsk        After searching the selection or range, Word displays a
                message asking whether to search the remainder of the
                document.

wdFindContinue   The find operation continues when the beginning or end of
                the search range is reached.

WdFindStop       The find operation ends when the beginning or end of the
                search range is reached.

The following Visual Basic for Applications examples set the search direction:

Searching Downward
------------------

The following macro example searches downward. When it reaches the end of the
document, it prompts you to continue searching from the beginning of the
document:

     Sub SearchDown()
        Selection.Find.ClearFormatting
        With Selection.Find
           .Text = "Word"
           .Forward = True
           .Wrap = wdFindAsk
        End With
        Selection.Find.Execute
     End Sub

Searching Upward
----------------

The following macro example searches upward. When it reaches the beginning of the
document, it prompts you to continue searching from the end of the document:

     Sub SearchUp()
        Selection.Find.ClearFormatting
           With Selection.Find
              .Text = "Word"
              .Forward = False
              .Wrap = wdFindAsk
           End With
           Selection.Find.Execute
     End Sub

Searching the Entire Document
-----------------------------

The following macro example searches the entire document. It does not prompt you
to continue searching when you reach the beginning or the end of the document:

     Sub SearchEntireDocument()
        Selection.Find.ClearFormatting
        With Selection.Find
           .Text = "Word"
           .Forward = True
           .Wrap = wdFindContinue
        End With
        Selection.Find.Execute
     End Sub
