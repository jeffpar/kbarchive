-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
- Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use Windows Explorer on a Windows-based computer to copy a file to an SMB
(Server Message Block) server using the Microsoft Client for Microsoft Networks,
the file may be truncated if the server's disk is full or nearly full.

The copy operation may seem to succeed, and no error message is displayed.
However, some data at the end of the file may be lost.

CAUSE
=====

This can occur if the amount of free disk space on the server is slightly less
than the size of the file being copied.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, make sure the disk on the network server contains
sufficient free space for the file being copied.

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem.

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information on support costs, please go to the following address on the World
Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later.

Windows 95:

  File name    Version   Date     Size
  ---------------------------------------------
  Vredir.vxd   4.00.958  7/23/96  140,403 bytes
  Shell32.dll  4.00.954  7/23/96  817,664 bytes

Windows 98:

  File name   Size     Date      Time   Version
  -----------------------------------------------
  Vredir.vxd  165,461  08/13/99  02:36  4.10.2149



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the operation being performed is a move operation instead of a copy
operation, or if the original file is deleted after being copied, the lost data
may not be recoverable except by restoring from a recent backup.
