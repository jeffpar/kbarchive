The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The performance problems of Microsoft Exchange 16-bit forms are not due to
client/server performance. They are due to loading large Visual Basic runtime
files off a disk, large forms executable files (200+ KB), and working set issues
for computers with less memory. This article gives some suggestions on how you
can increase form performance.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Forms must be downloaded locally from their respective source before they can be
run at all. This takes some time that you can note from the progress bar
indicating the forms installation. However, once the form is installed and
resides locally, the length of time for subsequent loadings of the form may be
increased.

On Windows NT Workstation 3.51, use the System Control Panel to set foreground
tasks=background tasks. For Windows NT Workstation 4.0, use the Application
Performance box on the Performance tab. If 16-bit applications are not generally
run, adding the Windows subsystem (Wowexec.exe) to the Startup group may offer
some performance benefits when loading the first form after starting the
computer.

For all platforms, you can increase the 2 MB default size of the Forms cache.
Depending on the size of the most recently used forms, doubling or tripling the
size of the cache generally gives improved form load performance for the five
most-used forms. You can do this from the Microsoft Exchange client by clicking
Options on the Tools menu, clicking the Exchange Server tab, and changing the
Maximum Space on Hard Disk option.
