SYMPTOMS
========

The Cisco/Interphase EISA FDDI/CDDI adapters do not support EISA bus preemption.
This may result in the adapter's being incompatible with PCs using a dual/split
PCI/EISA I/O bus.

The following models of Cisco/Interphase EISA FDDI/CDDI network adapters:

- WA-C321T-PC

- WA-C323T-PC

- WA-C326T-PC

- WA-C328T-PC

can cause intermittent system resets or crashes with STOP: 0X0000000A.

Some PC systems that are known to exhibit this symptom include:

- IBM PC Server 320 CYO

- Compaq Proliant series (some models)

- ALR Revolution Quad6


CAUSE
=====

The Interphase EISA FDDI/CDDI adapter requires guaranteed access time (GAT) to
function properly. PCs that implement EISA bus preemption without also
supporting GAT will experience problems. The symptom is intermittent and occurs
when both the FDDI adapter and a PCI device are active.

The adapter design predates implementation of the EISA bus preemption feature as
described in EISA specification 3.12 (PCI/EISA systems shipped after 9/1/95).

In PCs with both a PCI and an EISA bus, PCI devices are allowed access to system
memory even if the EISA bus has been granted control. Because the adapter
requires GAT, and because PCI devices are able to de-assert the EXRDY (external
ready) signal to the EISA bus, the adapter will stall and not finish its
transfer to memory.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you are experiencing this problem, first contact your system vendor to see if
your PC supports GAT mode. If your PC does not support GAT, consider the
following two workarounds:

- Reduce adapter transfer burst size from 64 bytes to 32 bytes. This reduces
  burst transfer time and has a positive effect on some systems. This can be
  changed in the registry entries for the drivers (C320tnt.sys). To make this
  change, follow the steps listed below:

  WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
  problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
  Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
  Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

  1. Run Regedt32 and select the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE Window

  2. Go to SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\c320tnt1\parameters

  3. Change the "BurstSize" from 63 (3F hex) to 31 (1F hex)

- An alternative for adding FDDI connectivity, for systems with PCI slots, is
  the Interphase PCI/FDDI 5511.

  NOTE: Don't use an EISA adapter in PCs with active PCI devices. Use the
  adapter only in PCs that have an EISA bus.
