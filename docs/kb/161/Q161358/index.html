SYMPTOMS
========

When a local view performing a Right Outer Join executes, the result set in the
view's Browse shows .NULL. in all of the left-side table's fields where there is
an unmatched row in the right-side table. If the view is defined with an
updateable left-side table when data is entered into the primary key field of
that table and the record pointer is moved, an information message box shows the
error "Update conflict" with the "OK," "Revert," and "Help" options.

If data is entered into any of the other fields, you receive a "Syntax error"
message.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can remove this by issuing the following command:

     =TableRevert(.T.)

If you modify only the primary key field and the "Update error" message appears,
and if you click Revert, the row again shows .NULL. for all the fields in the
left table portion of that row.

If you click OK, the command " = TableUpdate(0,.T.)" (without the quotes) is
issued and that row in the view is marked as deleted.

If, then, the command "SET DELETED ON" is issued, the row disappears from the
view. It reappears with the command "SET DELETED OFF."

MORE INFORMATION
================

The NULL row in the view is a "virtual row" with no correspondent in the base
left-side table. If a forced update based only on the Primary Key fails, it
indicates that the base-table row is inaccessible (as is the virtual row in the
view). In this case Visual FoxPro deletes the conflicting row from the view.
Because of the soft delete mechanism in Visual FoxPro, the user can control the
visibility of deleted rows via the command SET DELETED ON /OFF.

Attempting to fill in the fields in the view from the left-side base table would
require performing an INSERT... SQL for the full corresponding row in the
left-side table.
