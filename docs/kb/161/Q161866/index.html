The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 3.x prompts you for a Domain Logon. If
you don't want to be prompted for the Domain Logon, you can prevent the
Microsoft Exchange client from prompting for it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To prevent the Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 3.x from prompting you for
a Domain Logon, use the following steps:

1. Check whether the Use Network Security During Logon option is selected. If
  this option is selected, you will log on to the computer running Microsoft
  Exchange Server using the same network security identity that you established
  when you logged on to your network. Select this option if your network logon
  identity gives you permission for your mailbox. If you clear this option, you
  will be prompted for your logon credentials when you start the Microsoft
  Exchange client. You can view the state of this option by doing the
  following:

  a. Start the Microsoft Exchange client.

  b. On the Tools menu, click Services.

  c. Select the Microsoft Exchange Server service.

  d. Click the Properties button.

  e. Click the Advanced tab.

2. Check whether you have a password list (.pwl) file. In Windows for
  Workgroups, password caching is a feature that maintains a list of the
  passwords that you have used, and the resources to which they apply.
  Passwords are saved and retrieved transparently to you. The password cache
  enables the restoration of connections to shared resources when you log on.
  This file should exist in the Windows directory, and appear as Username.pwl.
  If it does exist, it may be corrupted. Create a new one by deleting the old
  file and restarting both Windows for Workgroups and the Microsoft Exchange
  client. This will create a new .pwl file, so you should test it again.

3. Check whether real-mode IPX/SPX is your only network protocol. Real-mode
  IPX/SPX does not support named pipes, and this support is needed to make
  authenticated remote procedure calls (RPCs). If this is your only protocol,
  you must use a .pwl file to eliminate the domain logon prompt.

4. Check whether any of your installed protocols support named pipes. Again,
  named pipe support is required for authenticated RPCs. If none of your
  protocols support named pipes, you must use a .pwl file.

5. Check whether named pipes is first in the binding order. When the Microsoft
  Exchange client is installed, it sets the default RPC binding order that
  determines the order of network protocols that RPC attempts to bind over. If
  named pipes is first, verify that the Rpc16c1.dll file is present on the
  computer, make sure that the computer running Microsoft Exchange Server
  supports named pipes, and test it using Rping.exe. For more information about
  the RPC Ping troubleshooting tool, please refer to the Microsoft Exchange
  Administrator's Guide. If named pipes is not first, you can change the order
  on this computer by editing the Exchng.ini file in the Windows directory. For
  future installations from a network installation point, a Microsoft Exchange
  administrator can use the Microsoft Exchange Setup Editor to change the
  default binding order.
