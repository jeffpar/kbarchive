-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0, 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open a project (.pjx) in Visual FoxPro 5.0, the following error message
appears:

  SCC API error "Project created" occurred. The project will be opened without
  source control.

After the project opens, no source control glyphs appear in the project window,
and no source control options are available on the Visual FoxPro 5.0 menu.

CAUSE
=====

You deleted the SourceSafe project that was associated with this .pjx project.

RESOLUTION
==========

For example, the project "Tastrade.pjx" is under SourceSafe control in a project
named $/FoxApps/Tastrade.

If you did not select the "destroy permanently" checkbox when you deleted the
Tastrade project, the integration with the .pjx can be restored to its previous
state by following these steps:

1. Close the project (.pjx).

2. The Visual SourceSafe Explorer lists a project named $/FoxApps/Tastrade that
  does not have any files in it. You may have to collapse and expand the Visual
  SourceSafe tree view to see this project. Select the project. On the File
  menu, choose Delete.

  IMPORTANT: Ensure that the "destroy permanently" checkbox is selected.

3. In the Visual SourceSafe Explorer, highlight the parent project of the
  project that was linked to the .pjx (in this example select $/FoxApps). On
  the File menu, choose Properties. The Deleted Items tab lists the deleted
  Tastrade project. Click "Recover." The $/FoxApps/Tastrade appears in the
  Visual SourceSafe Explorer.

4. Finally, select the Tastrade.pjm file (for every .pjx, a .pjm file is created
  by the integration) in the Visual SourceSafe Explorer and check it out.

NOTE: If you open Tastrade.pjx in Visual FoxPro, it now shows all of the
integration glyphs and the history of the files.

If you selected the "destroy permanently" checkbox when you deleted the Tastrade
project, you can add the .pjx back to SourceSafe, but you lose the history of
all the files. To do this, type the following Visual FoxPro commands in the
Command Window:

     CLOSE ALL
     USE Tastrade.pjx
     REPLACE ALL sccdata WITH ""
     USE
     MODIFY PROJECT Tastrade

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this behavior and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Add a project (.pjx) to source control as described in the "Visual FoxPro
  Developer's Guide," Chapter 29, pages 678 [ASCII 150] 680, under the heading
  "Putting Projects Under Source Control."

2. Close the project (.pjx).

3. Start the Visual SourceSafe Explorer, and delete the project that is
  associated with the project (.pjx).

4. In Visual FoxPro 5.0, open the project (.pjx) and the error occurs.
