-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When the directory and file permissions are set to Read (RX) for the root of
drive C on a computer running Windows NT, the Systems Management Server client
setup program, Cli_nt.exe, cannot update the Sms.ini file. Even if the group
"Everyone" is given full rights to the Sms.ini file, the file will not be
updated. The following error message, indicating that Client Setup is unable to
update the Sms.ini file, will be displayed when the application runs:

  Problem opening or creating SMS.INI

CAUSE
=====

Systems Management Server Client Setup attempts to create a temporary file in
the root of drive C with a unique file name that is determined at the time of
file creation. It will then write what will be the current contents of the
Sms.ini file to this temporary file. Once this step has been completed, and no
errors are detected, Client Setup will then copy the temporary file to Sms.ini,
and then delete the temporary file.

Because all standard user rights can be locked down in drive C (according to
Windows NT security recommendations), the Systems Management Server inventory
operation described above will fail while trying to create a new temporary file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, provide 'Change (RWXD)' rights to the root of drive
C.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. A supported fix is now available for version 1.2
only, but has not been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by
this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service
Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more
information.


MORE INFORMATION
----------------

The supported fix requires a new Cli_nt.exe file that exposes the temporary file
name created during the Sms.ini update. The new file name is Sms.new. If this
file does not exist, it will be created in the root of drive C. If it does
already exist, it will be opened and truncated. After Sms.new is created or
opened, the updated Sms.ini information is written to this file. When this
operation is completed, the file is copied back to Sms.ini. This file is no
longer be deleted, but flagged with the Hidden file attribute instead.

Administrators can create a blank Sms.new file in a user's root directory, assign
it the appropriate rights, and then lock down all other files except Sms.ini.
This allows administrators to lock down the entire root directory on computer
running Windows NT, except for the Sms.new and Sms.ini files, and the Systems
Management Server inventory mechanism will continue to work properly.
