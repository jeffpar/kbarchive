SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW), the following error
message may appear when you attempt to add a share in the Configure Gateway
dialog box on the Windows NT Server computer:

  The specified user does not exist. To create a gateway share, both the
  currently logged on user and the gateway account must have access to the
  NetWare resource. Also, the gateway account must be in the NTGateway group on
  the NetWare server and the current user must have the right to create a share
  on the local computer.

This will happen even if the above statement is true.

CAUSE
=====

The most likely cause for this problem is the Gateway Account is set
incorrectly.

If bindery emulation is not enabled on the Novell NetWare 4.x server and the
gateway is enabled in Windows NT, the fully qualified NDS user name must be
specified by the GSNW tool in Control Panel. To do this, double- click the GSNW
icon in Control Panel, click Gateway, click Enable Gateway so that it is
selected, and then enter the Gateway Account information.

NOTE: The NTGATEWAY group and NTUSER accounts do not have to be in the same
context of the NetWare server as long as they have access to the server volume.

The following is an example of how the Gateway Account should be set:

  ntuser.users.lcipx (or cn=ntuser.ou=users.o=lcipx)

If only NTUSER is specified here, then it assumes the connection to the NetWare
server should be using bindery emulation and the same error happens.

In this case, bindery emulation should be enabled at the NetWare server (SET
BINDERY CONTEXT=users.lcipx, in this example, at the console, or in
Autoexec.ncf). Both NTUSER and NTGATEWAY accounts SHOULD be under the same
context also. Otherwise, the system will display the following error:

  To create a gateway share, both the currently logged on user and the gateway
  account must have access to the NetWare resource. Also, the gateway account
  must be in the NTGateway group on the NetWare server and the current user
  must have the right to create a share on the local computer.

This error can occur if a fully qualified name for the Gateway account is not
specified. By enabling bindery emulation, the fully qualified name is no longer
an issue, and therefore fixes the problem.

WORKAROUND
==========

Create and use a different account in the NTGateway group on the NetWare Server
computer. Make sure that the same account and password created on the Windows NT
Server computer is a member of the administrators group and is used to log on to
the Windows NT Server computer when you install GSNW.

-or-

Enable bindery emulation on the NetWare server computer.
