SUMMARY
=======

LAN Manager 2.0 and 2.0a cannot differentiate between file permissions for
CD-ROM Drive 1 and CD-ROM Drive 2. It can determine only that there is an E
drive, and it enforces whatever permissions have been created for files or
directories on E, no matter which CD happens to be in the CD-ROM drive. The same
is true for floppy disks and drives, and for any other removable media.

MORE INFORMATION
================

ACLs (Access Control Lists) for CD-ROM, floppy, and other removable media are
kept in the NET.ACC file (as are hard disk FAT partition ACLs).

ACLs created for a file or directory on a CD-ROM drive are recorded in NET.ACC
with reference to a drive letter and the designated path or file name. Thus, if
you assign read-only access privilege to User1 for the file \DOCS\BOOK.BAR on a
CD-ROM drive that the operating system sees as drive E, the ACL entry in NET.ACC
looks like this:

FILE ID             USER        PERMISSIONS
e:\docs\book.bar    User1        R

This entry remains in NET.ACC regardless of which CD is in the CD-ROM drive.
Thus, if you remove CD 1 and insert CD 2 and give User1 read and write
permission on the file \STUFF\SANE.TXT file on that CD, the NET.ACC entries look
like this:

FILE ID             USER         PERMISSIONS
e:\docs\book.bar    User1         R
e:\stuff\sane.txt   User1         RW

Now, if you remove CD 2 and re-insert CD 1, the ACL referencing E:\DOCS\BOOK.BAR
remains in NET.ACC and is still enforced.
