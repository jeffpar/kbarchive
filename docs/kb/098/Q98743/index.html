-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0 
- Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5x, 2.6 
- Microsoft FoxPro for MS-DOS, versions 2.0, 2.5x, 2.6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

When FoxPro returns the error message "Not a Database File," you can sometimes
correct the damaged file's header by using a hexadecimal file editor.

WARNING: Before attempting to modify a database in this way, it is STRONGLY
recommended that you back up the database.

The structure of the database file header is given below.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "Not a database file" error message in FoxPro 2.x may be caused by a record
count value in the table header that is greater than the actual number of
records. The Hexedit.app, distributed with Visual FoxPro 5.0 may be used in an
attempt to correct the record count. In the Hexedit.app, a hexadecimal
representation of the record count may be found at Address: 0000000 in columns
4, 5, 6, and 7. Use the calculator in Windows 95 or Windows NT to convert from
decimal to hexadecimal and remember to reverse the order of the numbers as per
this article.

For information about performing table maintenance using FoxPro low-level file
functions, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

The table below identifies the bytes in the first part of the header:

  Byte number   Description
  -------------------------------------------------------------

  1             File-type identifier:
                   03 - DBF without memo (FoxBASE+/FoxPro/dBASE
                        III PLUS/dBASE IV)
                   83 - DBF with memo (FoxBASE+/dBASE III PLUS)
                   8B - dBASE III with memo
                   F5 - FoxPro with memo
  2-4           Date of last update (YYMMDD)
  5-8           Number of records in file*
  9-10          Offset to start of data**
  11-12         Size of record***
  13-28         Not used
  29            Flag for compound index****
  30-32         Not used

  * The number of records in the database is stored in reverse
    format. In other words, if those bytes were equivalent to F4 01
    00 00, there would be 500 records in the database. 1F4h is the
    hexadecimal equivalent of decimal 500.

 ** The offset to the start of the data is computed from the
    beginning of the file to the first data record. It also is stored
    in reverse format. For example, if bytes 9 and 10 are 41 02, the
    first data record would begin at 241h, or 577 decimal bytes from
    the beginning of the file.

*** The size of the record also is stored in reverse format; the
    number represents the sum of the field sizes plus 1 because of
    the deletion flag.

**** The flag for the compound index will be 01h if there is a
    structural .CDX file attached to the database, and 00h if there
    is not an associated structural .CDX file.

The second part of the header depends on the number of fields in the database.
Each field uses 32 bytes. There is also a single terminating byte (0Dh) at the
very end.

The field definition is as follows:

  Byte number   Description
  ------------------------------------------------------

  1-11          Field name
  12            Field type
                Character 43h
                Date      44h
                Logical   4Ch
                Memo      4Dh
                Numeric   4Eh
  13-14         Offset of field from beginning of record
  15-16         Not used
  17-18         Field length (nonnumeric fields)
  17            Field length (numeric fields)
  18            Field decimals (numeric fields)
  19-32         Not used

FoxPro limits field names to ten characters; thus the eleventh byte, or the last
(rightmost) byte, after the field name, must be null (00h). The field length is
dependent upon the data type. Character fields use the seventeenth and
eighteenth bytes, in reverse format.

Memo, date, and logical fields, which have fixed lengths of 10, 8, and 1,
respectively, need only the first byte (17). The remaining bytes are generally
nulls. However, keep in mind that there is a terminating byte of 0Dh at the very
end of the header.

After the terminating 0Dh byte, the actual database data begins. The first byte
of each record is the deletion flag. If the record has been deleted, but not
packed, this byte will be 2Ah (an ASCII asterisk); otherwise, it is 20h (an
ASCII space).

For DBF files created in Visual FoxPro for Windows, or 2.x DBF files added to a
Database Container (DBC), the backlink information is stored between byte 0DH
and the beginning of the data.
