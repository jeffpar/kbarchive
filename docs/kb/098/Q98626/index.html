SUMMARY
=======

AnnoPrnt.exe is a Windows for Pen Computing sample that demonstrates how to
annotate a text file with ink, and then print out the resulting annotated text
to any printer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Software
Library:

  AnnoPrnt.exe

Using the AnnoPrnt.exe sample as a starting point, developers can view one method
to output annotated text. Certain Windows for Pen Computing application
programming interfaces (APIs) are more suited to output to printer devices. This
is the case here with using DrawPenData rather than RedisplayPenData.
RedisplayPenData is more device-dependent on the video driver and not meant to
be used in printer calls.

The AnnoPrnt.exe sample also shows how to output different colors of ink so that
developers can view the results of the color mapping on their respective
printer; some colors are mapped such that they don't show up on a printer.

Another method of printing involves printing the entire image (the annotated text
file) as a device-independent bitmap (DIB), thus allowing the driver, not GDI,
to do the color mapping. Drivers typically do a better mapping to grayscale, and
therefore if color is important, using DIBs is an alternative. The WINCAP sample
in the Software Library demonstrates outputting DIBs to printers.

The AnnoPrnt.exe sample was carefully checked for possible printing problems;
however, because so much is dependent on printer drivers, future errors are
possible.
