-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

If you start your computer from a 1.2-megabyte (MB) 5.25-inch disk created with
SETUP /F, you receive the following error message if you try to resize a
compressed volume on your hard disk drive:

  DoubleSpace cannot change the size of drive A because there is not enough
  free space on your original startup drive, which is now drive A. DoubleSpace
  will need at least 0.14 MB of free space on that drive. Delete some files on
  that drive, and try this operation again.

NOTE: Although the a 1.2-MB boot disk most commonly causes this error message,
you receive this error message any time you try to resize the compressed drive
when the boot drive has insufficient disk space.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the following files must be copied to drive A:

  DBLSPACE.INF
  DBLSPACE.HLP
  DEFRAG.EXE
  Backup copy of AUTOEXEC.BAT
  Backup copy of CONFIG.SYS

DoubleSpace requires these tools are on boot drive to ensure it can continue if
it must restart the computer or if the computer is restarted inadvertently.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, make available approximately 151,040 kilobytes (K)
of disk space (on the disk in drive A) for the backup files. To do this, delete
MSD.EXE and XCOPY.EXE from drive A. For example, type the following commands at
the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER after each line:

  " del a:\msd.exe
  del a:\xcopy.exe " (without the quotation marks)

You should now be able to resize the compressed volume on your hard disk drive.

NOTE: Deleting these two files frees up enough disk space as long as your
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files are not larger that 1024K each. If they are
larger, you may need to delete additional files from the startup disk.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is a complete list of the files that must be present on the boot
drive to be able to resize a DoubleSpace-compressed drive:

  DBLSPACE.EXE
  DBLSPACE.HLP
  DBLSPACE.INF
  DBLSPACE.WIN - Temporary file of approximately 100 bytes
  DEFRAG.EXE
  AUTOEXEC.BAT

These files require approximately 424,079 bytes.

NOTE: The bytes-required values in this article are calculated based on 512K
sector allocation.

Additional query words: 6.00 6.20 double space
