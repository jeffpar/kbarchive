SYMPTOMS
========

Using the "tear-off" feature on the Okidata ML-380 printer may result in the
document printing .75 inch onto the next page. The tear-off feature causes the
print head to be positioned approximately .75 inch from the top of the paper.
Windows assumes that the top margin starts where the print head is positioned.

CAUSE
=====

The Okidata ML-380 printer tear-off feature advances the paper so that the
perforation is under a straight edge bar. This make it easier to separate pages
but creates problems determining where the top of the page is located.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

- Subtract .75 inch from the top and bottom margins set in the application.
  Leave the printer driver margins set to 0 (zero). (The printer driver margins
  are set in Control Panel.)

- Use the Epson LQ-850 printer driver and set the top margin to .75 inch. To do
  this, open Control Panel, choose the Printers icon, choose Setup, then choose
  Options and reset the top margin value.

- Disable the tear-off feature on the printer.

This problem is caused by the printer driver not using the form feed command to
move to the next page; instead, it uses line spacing. The tear-off feature
itself does not cause this problem. If you set a top margin for the printer
driver in Control Panel, the margin will be that much shorter on each page.
