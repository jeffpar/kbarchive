SUMMARY
=======

The MS-DOS-based game "Where in the World Is Carmen San Diego" may work with
interruptions when running with Windows. In Windows enhanced mode, the game can
run from MS-DOS Prompt in a full screen with Sound Blaster emulation from
Windows Sound System; but in some cases, you may need to turn off the virtual
interrupt request line (IRQ) for the game to run properly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The MS-DOS-based game, "Carmen San Diego USA/Deluxe and World/Deluxe Versions"
from Broderbund can run in Windows enhance mode from MS-DOS Prompt in a full
screen with Sound Blaster support after you configure the Windows Sound System
for Sound Blaster emulation. Sound Blaster emulation will allow the game to play
digitized sounds while you run the game. However, in some cases the game may be
interrupted after a digitized sound is played, and you may have to press the ESC
key to continue.

When this happens, you will need to turn off the virtual hard drive IRQ from
Windows, which is on by default for AT-class machines. Turning this off allows
Windows to terminate the hard drive interrupt without having to go to the
read-only memory (ROM). To turn off the virtual hard drive IRQ, make the
following modification to your SYSTEM.INI file:

1. From MS-DOS, open the SYSTEM.INI file in a text editor. The SYSTEM.INI file
  should be located in your Windows directory.

2. Locate the [386enh] section and add or modify the following line:

        VirtualHDIRQ=False

3. Save the changes, exit the editor, and run Windows in enhanced mode.

4. From Windows enhanced mode, start MS-DOS Prompt and run the game.

  NOTE: Disabling VirtualHDIRQ may degrade the performance of Windows in 386
  enhanced mode.

For more information about the game, contact the game's manufacturer.
