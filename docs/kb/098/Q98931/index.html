SUMMARY
=======

Go Figure! is an equation-solving math game. The objective in Go Figure! is
always the same: Arrange the four numbers and any of the operator signs to
create an equation that equals the answer provided in the Target box.

The game can be played at a skill setting of beginner, intermediate or expert.
All three skill settings progress through 10 levels of play. Solve an equation
puzzle and you advance to the next game level. A game continues until you either
complete level 10 or run out of points (which are deducted for getting a wrong
answer, taking too long, or asking for hints).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Each game in Go Figure! consists of 10 levels of play. Because only one equation
puzzle must be solved per level at the beginner skill setting, a beginner game
has 10 equations to solve. An Intermediate game has 20 equations to solve and an
expert game has 30 equations.

Go Figure! provides you with four numbers, four operator signs and the answer.
Your job is to place the four numbers and whatever operators you care to use
into the correct order to match the answer. If you need a hint, choose the Hint
button and the computer fills in a number and an operator sign.

Playing Go Figure! is as simple as pointing your mouse and clicking. But behind
the scenes the computer is randomly selecting numbers to plug into each equation
puzzle it creates. With the millions of possible combinations, it is unlikely
you will ever see the same puzzle twice.
