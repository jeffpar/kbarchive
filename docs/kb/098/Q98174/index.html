SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to recognize inherited versus explicit permissions and
discusses how each can be set.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine if a file or directory has an ACL on it, or is just getting
permissions from its parent, do the following:

From the command line, use the "NET ACCESS d:\path" or "NET ACCESS
d:\path\filename" command. The backslash (\) after the colon in the drive letter
is required as a part of the proper syntax of the command. A net2222 means that
no ACL is applied directly to that directory or file. There is a possibility
that you will get the resource name listed but with no assigned permissions.
This indicates that there was once an ACL associated with the resource but that
it was removed at some point in time with the Revoke or Revoke All option under
Zoom in the View Permissions dialog box of View, Shared Resources. The same
result will occur if the command line "NET ACCESS /revoke username" is used for
the only user with permissions for that resource.

In NET ADMIN initial screen, choose View then Shared Resources, and select a
sharename. Next, choose View Permissions, then select the directory or file you
want information on and select Zoom. If the "Use default permissions" box is
checked, the directory or file you selected is inheriting permissions from a
higher level.

If you use the Permit Tree option of the View Permissions dialog box under View,
Shared Resources, then explicit permissions will be applied to all
subdirectories under the Permit Tree point. These permissions will not be
applied to the files in these directories.

If you use the Revoke Tree option of the View Permissions dialog box under View,
Shared Resources, then all implicit and explicit permissions will be removed
from the point at which you did the Revoke Tree and the tree below it. If this
is done, a "NET ACCESS ..." on any part of the tree will produce a net2222.

If you assign an explicit permission for a user or group to a resource when
implicit permissions already exist, then one of two changes will be made. If
this is done by selecting Permit in the View Permissions dialog box of View,
Shared Resources, then the implicit permissions will be converted to explicit
permissions and the new explicit permission will be added. If "NET ACCESS
&lt;share point&gt; /add &lt;user name&gt;:&lt;permissions&gt;" is used, then
the implicit permissions will be removed, leaving only the permissions specified
in the "NET ACCESS ..." command applied to the resource.
