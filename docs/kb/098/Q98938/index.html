SUMMARY
=======

JezzBall is a game of elimination. The objective of JezzBall is to trap Jezz
atoms in the smallest possible chambers. You make the chambers smaller with the
wallbuilder. The challenge is to gauge enough time to anchor your wall on both
sides of the chamber before it is struck by an atom. If only one side of your
wall anchors before being hit by an atom, a partial wall is left behind but the
cost is one chamber life.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There is a time limit for each game level in JezzBall. The more atoms at play in
the capture chamber, the more time you are allotted for trapping them. The
countdown clock is shown in the upper-right corner of the screen.

You advance to the next level when the walls you build reduce the chamber by at
least 75 percent. If you reduce the chamber more than 75 percent, you are
awarded extra points. Each time you advance a level, an additional Jezz atom is
placed in the chamber. The more atoms you work with, the higher your points. If
the atoms are moving too fast, you can slow them down, but you'll only earn half
as many points.

JezzBall computes your score based upon how much of the capture chamber you can
eliminate. The chamber is divided into squares. You get points for each square
that you eliminate including those squares knocked out by the wallbuilder and
empty areas that are cut off from the chamber.

Scoring
-------

At the beginning level, with two atoms, and at slow speed, you receive 3.5 points
for each square eliminated, 70 points for each vertical column, and 98 points
for each horizontal column. At fast speed the points are doubled. The greater
the number of atoms in the chamber, the more points you are awarded for each
square that you eliminate.

Bonus points are awarded at the completion of each level based upon how
completely you eliminated the squares of the capture chamber. The first level of
bonus points is given for each percent of space eliminated above 80 percent. The
second level of bonus points kicks in for each percentage eliminated above 90
percent. These bonus points increase according to how many atoms are in play.
