Problem:

When compiled with QuickC 2.00, the second line of the following code
generates the error "C2125: too_big : allocation exceeds 64K." The
same code compiles without error under C 5.10.

   char not_big[0x0FFFF];
   char too_big[0x10000];

In compact or large model, the definition of too_big should be legal.
Although too_big is being defined as 0x10000 bytes, the indices for
the array goes only from 1 to 0xFFFF, which is a single segment. The
following array definition results in the same error:

   char still_too_big[0x100][0x100];

Again, this should be legal since the space taken by the array is a
single segment.

Response:

This problem is caused by a limitation of the QuickC compiler and the
way in which it stores information concerning arrays. The upper limit
of an array is stored in a single word, which can hold only values up
to 0xFFFF. The upper limit of the arrays shown above are 0x10000;
thus, they do not fit in the word used by QuickC 2.00 and are
tagged with C2125.

A workaround of the limitation would be to declare a pointer to the
required type, and then allocate space for it with either halloc or
_dos_allocmem.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information as
it becomes available.
