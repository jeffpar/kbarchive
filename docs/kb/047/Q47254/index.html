Borland's SideKick Version 1.56x has been found to cause problems
with keyboard input in QuickC and QuickAssembler.

The following routines have been observed to show the problem with
SideKick loaded: gets, getch, getche, cgets, cscanf, scanf, and kbhit.

In all cases, when a program requiring keyboard input is run with one
of these routines, input does not occur as expected. The first 15 keys
pressed during a call to one of these run-time library functions do
not appear on the run screen. The 16th and all following keys are
received by the input function/procedure. Upon termination of the
program being run under the QuickC environment, the 15 keys pressed
during run time appear on the QuickC editing screen.

To alleviate this problem, either do not load SideKick after booting,
or use the Hot-Key combination to remove it from memory. The key
combination should be used at the DOS command prompt, as follows:

   CTRL+ALT (To call up the main selection window), then
   CTRL+HOME+END
