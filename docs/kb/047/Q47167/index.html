Problem:

When I am compiling and linking from floppy drives, there are times
when QuickC does not find the linker (LINK or ILINK). When this
happens, I get an error with the option to RETRY. If I then switch
floppies, placing the proper version of the linker in the drive, the
error does not go away.

Response:

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with QuickC Version 2.00
and with QuickAssembler Version 2.01. We are researching this problem
and will post new information as it becomes available.

There are two ways, however, that you can work around this
problem. Your first option is to wait until the error appears, choose
CANCEL, insert the proper floppy disk, and then choose BUILD PROGRAM
from the MAKE menu. Because the .OBJ file is up-to-date, QuickC will
not try to recompile, but will go directly to the link stage. With the
new disk in the drive, QuickC will find the linker without a problem.

To avoid the error completely, compile and link in two stages. This
means selecting the MAKE menu and then the COMPILE FILE option. After
the file compiles without errors, place the linker floppy disk in the
proper drive. Next, choose the BUILD PROGRAM option from the MAKE
menu. This is similar to the above procedure but will not generate
the error message because the linker is not searched for until the
BUILD PROGRAM option is selected.
