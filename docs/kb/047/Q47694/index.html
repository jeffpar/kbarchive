CodeView is unable to display elements of structures declared with the
following keywords:

   near
   far
   pascal
   fortran

Using ?? to display a structure yields the structure table with only
one value inside. This value is the first element in the structure.
Using w? or ? yields the following error message:

   Operand types incorrect for this operation

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with CodeView Versions
2.20 and 2.30. We are researching this problem and will post new
information as it becomes available.

To work around this problem, recompile without these keywords, or
obtain the address of the structure element and put a watch on the
memory location.

Consider the following large model program:

struct { int x;
         int y;
         int z;} near a;    /* or far, pascal, fortran */

void main(void)
{
  a.x = 1;
}

To put a watch on a.x, you could issue the following commands:

? &amp;a
0x0345:0000       &lt;- result is the address of the structure
ww 0x0345:0x0     &lt;- address of x
ww 0x0345:0x2     &lt;- address of y (two byte int from x)

This puts a watch on the first and second elements (x and y) in the
structure.
