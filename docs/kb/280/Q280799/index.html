-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Indexing Service 
- Microsoft Index Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Indexing Service to index documents that are stored on remote
shares, the check for the current users' permissions against the Access Control
Lists (ACLs) on the documents is not enforced when searches are performed.
Therefore, a search may return documents that the user who performs the search
does not have read access to.

In addition, a search results page often displays a small section (called an
"abstract") of the document in the result set. In this case, document
information is displayed that the user who performs the search does not have
permission to read.

CAUSE
=====

When you add a remote path to an Index Server catalog, either by adding a remote
virtual root to an indexed Web site or by adding a remote path directly to the
Index Server catalog, you must supply a valid user name and password to map to
the remote share. The user name and password are used to access the remote
resource to index the documents that are stored there.

When a search is performed against an Index Server catalog for documents that are
indexed at a remote location, the context of the account that is used to map to
the remote location is used to build the results of the search. Therefore, the
search results for a remote location include all documents that the mapping
account has access to at that location, regardless of the access permissions of
the current user who performs the search.

WORKAROUND
==========

To obtain search results that include only documents that the user who performs
the search has read access to, perform one of the following workarounds:

- Store all documents on the same computer as the Indexing Service.

- Use the Search service that comes with Microsoft Site Server 3.0. This
  indexes the ACLs on NTFS files that are stored remotely and locally.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The current user context is used for security checks against documents that are
indexed locally. The search result set returns only local documents that the
user who performs the search has read access to.

Additional query words: UNC security crawl
