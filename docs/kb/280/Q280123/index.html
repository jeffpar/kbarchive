The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run an Active Server Page (ASP), an internal net library (NetLib) error
may occur on subsequent attempts to instantiate DB2OLEDB Decision Support
Objects (DSOs):

  Interface: IID_IDBInitialize
  Result: 0x80040e14 = DB_E_ERRORSINCOMMAND
  ISQLErrorInfo:[HY000][0xfff0bdc1]
  Source: "Microsoft DB2 OLE DB Provider"
  IErrorInfo:[0x00000000]"Internal NetLib Error"


RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Host Integration Server (HIS) 2000 Service Pack that
contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

+---------------------------------+
| File name    | Date     | Time  | 
+---------------------------------+
| Mseidb2d.dll | 12/15/00 | 12:25 | 
+---------------------------------+
| Mseidrda.dll | 12/15/00 | 12:25 | 
+---------------------------------+
| Mseidpm.dll  | 12/15/00 | 12:25 | 
+---------------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.




STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Host Integration Server 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce the Problem
------------------------------

1. Run a simple ASP. View the results in a Web browser. Leave Microsoft Internet
  Information Server (IIS) and Microsoft Internet Explorer running.

2. Attempt to instantiate the DB2OLEDB DSO by using any application (Data Links,
  RowsetViewer, and so on). This results in the error (RowsetViewer), which
  shown in the "Symptoms" section.

The expected behavior is that when you connect by using any application, while
the IIS ASP is active, the connection succeeds.
