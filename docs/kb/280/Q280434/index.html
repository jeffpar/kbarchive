-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP3, 5.5 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program in Raw
mode, and you make a change to the "Hide from Address Book" attribute on a
public folder, the change does not seem to be applied. For example, if you
change the property of the "Hide from Address Book" attribute from 1 to 0 in Raw
mode, the public folder is not hidden from the address book; however, when you
use the Administrator program in Normal mode to view the properties of the
public folder, the "Hide from Address Book" check box is still selected.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because when the Administrator program is running in Raw
mode, only directory service objects are updated; the Administrator program does
not have an open session to the information store when it is running in Raw
mode. When the Administrator program opens the regular public folder properties
(and not the raw properties), it reads the information store.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, start the Administrator program in Normal mode, open
the public folder properties, and then click to clear the "Hide from Address
Book" check box.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior is by design.
