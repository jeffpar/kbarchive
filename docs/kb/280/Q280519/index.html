SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to start the World Wide Web (WWW) Publishing Service, you may
receive the following error message:

  Could not start the World Wide Web Publishing Service service on
  \\WEBSERVERNAME.

  Error 1058. The specified service is disabled and cannot be started.

As a result, the WWW Service fails to start. There are no corresponding event
viewer errors for this error.

This problem also occurs with File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Network News Transfer
Protocol (NNTP), or Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) services.

CAUSE
=====

The WWW, FTP, NNTP, or SMTP service has been disabled and cannot be started
until the service is reset to Automatic, Manual, or Enabled. When you install a
third-party application that conflicts with one of these services, the
third-party application's installer disables the service.

RESOLUTION
==========

In Microsoft Windows NT and Internet Information Server (IIS), a service can be
disabled either in the Startup settings (which is most common) or the Hardware
Profile settings.

NOTE: If one of these settings is changed, the other setting also changes to
correspond with the first. Therefore, if the Startup setting is changed to
Disabled, the Hardware Profile setting also reflects this change.

Startup Settings:

To correct this problem in the Startup settings, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Services.

2. Click to highlight the service that is failing, and then click Startup.

3. In the Startup type drop-down list, click Automatic or Manual.

4. Close the Startup screen, and click to start the service.

Hardware Profile Settings:

This setting is designed to assist those computers that have multiple
configurations. Third-party applications often disable the service in this area
to ensure that these services do not disrupt their product. To check and correct
problems in Hardware Profile, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Services.

2. Click to highlight the service that is failing, and then click Hardware
  Profiles.

3. Verify that the setting for the original configuration is enabled. If not,
  double-click to change the setting.
