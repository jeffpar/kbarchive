SYMPTOMS
========

Message journaling does not work on the day that is twenty-eight days before the
last day of the month when you configure the Exchange Server 5.5 message
transfer agent (MTA) message journaling component, and select a custom recipient
as the journaling recipient. Depending on how many days are in the month, this
behavior occurs on the second or third day of the month. For example, if there
are 31 days in the month, message journaling does not work on third day of the
month. If there are 30 days in the month, message journaling does not work on
the second day of the month, and so on. The journaling recipient receives
following non-delivery report (NDR):

Your message

 Subject: TEST
 Sent:    Sat, 2 Sep 2000 17:32:31 -0400

did not reach the following recipient(s):

MTA Journaling on Sat, 2 Sep 2000 17:32:31 -0400
   Unable to deliver the message due to a communications failure
	The MTS-ID of the original message is: c=US;a=
;p=MICROSOFT;l=TESTSERVER000902173231AE003300
