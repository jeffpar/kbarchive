-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
- Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.6 
- Microsoft SQL Server 2000 (all editions) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Queries that result in a large amount of XML data being returned through the
ReadText method of the ActiveX Data Object (ADO) Stream object may take a great
deal of time to execute; if this is done in a COM+ component that is invoked
from an ASP page, the user's session may time out.

CAUSE
=====

ADO converts Stream object data from UTF-8 encoding to Unicode; the frequent
memory reallocation involved in conversion of such a large quantity of data at
once is quite time-consuming.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make repeated calls to the ReadText method of the ADO command object, and
specify a smaller number of characters. Tests have shown that a value equivalent
to 128K (131,072) is optimal. Response time decreases as this value is
decreased.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Set a reference to ActiveX Data Objects 2.6.

3. Place a CommandButton on Form1.

4. Place the following code in the Click event of the CommandButton:

  On Error GoTo ErrorHandler

     Dim cnn As ADODB.Connection
     Dim cmd As ADODB.Command
     Dim str As ADODB.Stream

     Dim strXMLOutput As String
     Dim varStart     As Variant
     Dim varEnd       As Variant

     Const ReadBytes = 131072

     Screen.MousePointer = vbHourglass

     Set cnn = New ADODB.Connection
      
     With cnn
        .CursorLocation = adUseClient
        .Open "provider=sqloledb;data source=MyServer\MyInstance;initial &amp; _
        catalog=MyDatabase;user id=MyUserID;password=MyPassword;"
     End With

     Set str = New ADODB.Stream
      
     With str
        .Type = adTypeText
        .LineSeparator = adCRLF
        .Mode = adModeRead
        .Open
     End With

     Set cmd = New ADODB.Command
      
     With cmd
        Set .ActiveConnection = cnn
        .Properties("Output Stream").Value = str
        .CommandType = adCmdText
        .CommandText = "SELECT * FROM BigTable FOR XML AUTO"
        .Execute , , adExecuteStream
        Set .ActiveConnection = Nothing
     End With

     cnn.Close

     str.Position = 0
     
     varStart = Now
    
    'This technique results in a much faster assignment.
    'Uncomment this section for faster response.
  '   With str
  '      Do While Not .EOS
  '         strXMLOutput = strXMLOutput &amp; .ReadText(ReadBytes)
  '      Loop
  '   End With
     
    'Single call technique results in a much slower assignment.
    'Comment this out when uncommenting the code above.
     strXMLOutput = str.ReadText
     
     varEnd = Now

     MsgBox "ReadText completed:" &amp; vbCrLf &amp; "Start=" &amp; varStart &amp; ", End=" &amp; _
            varEnd &amp; vbCrLf &amp; "Total bytes read: " &amp; Len(strXMLOutput), vbOKOnly + vbInformation, "ReadText"

  Bye:
     Set str = Nothing
     Set cmd = Nothing
     Set cnn = Nothing

     Screen.MousePointer = vbDefault

     Exit Sub
     
  ErrorHandler:
     MsgBox "Error " &amp; Err.Number &amp; ": " &amp; Err.Description, vbOKOnly + vbCritical, "Stream Error"
     GoTo Bye

5. Replace MyServer, MyInstance, MyDatabase, MyUserID and MyPassword with
  appropriate values for your database server.

6. Modify the SQL query as appropriate for your database.

7. Run the application with the ReadText loop commented out, as in the preceding
  code.

8. Comment out the single ReadText method call, and uncomment the ReadText loop.
  Note that there is a significant improvement in response time.

NOTE: This has been tested with a 60,000 row recordset, returning a 12.8 MB XML
document. Using a single call to the ReadText method, response time was over 10
minutes; using the loop, response time was reduced to less than thirty seconds.
