SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to configure the flight logbook in Microsoft Flight
Simulator to automatically record your flight time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: During a flight the logbook entries do not get populated. The logbook will
get populated once you exit the flight. You will only receive notification when
you exit the game.

To record your flight time in Flight Simulator 2000:

1. Start a new flight in Flight Simulator 2000.

2. Click Options, click Settings, and then click General.

3. Click to select the "Log flight time" check box.

4. Click Add Entry, and then click OK.

5. Click the green check mark or OK to accept the settings.

To view your flight logbook entries in the game:

1. Start a flight in Flight Simulator.

2. Click Options, and then click Logbook.

3. Double-click the logbook entry that you want under Log entries.

4. When you are finished viewing your logbook entry, click the green check mark.

The logbook entries are located in the following default folder:

Flight Simulator 2000:

  &lt;drive&gt;:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Fs2000\Pilots

Flight Simulator 2002:

  &lt;drive&gt;:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\FS2002\flights\myflts

where &lt;drive&gt; is the letter of the hard disk on which Flight Simulator 2000
or Flight Simulator 2002 are installed.

To view the logbook entries in the Pilots folder, double-click the default
Logbook.log or the logbook that you created in the game.

NOTE: If you are prompted to select the program that you want to use to open the
logbook file, click NotePad in the "Choose the program you want to use" box.
Click to clear the "Always use this program to open this file" check box, and
then click OK.
