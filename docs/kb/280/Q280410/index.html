MORE INFORMATION

Crimson Skies Update Version 1.02
---------------------------------

The Crimson Skies Update version 1.02 includes the earlier save game fix that was
corrected in the Crimson Skies Update version 1.01. In addition, the Crimson
Skies Update version 1.02 addresses the following issues with multiplayer games,
stability, and performance:

- Reduction in players dropped when you start a multiplayer game via Zone.com

- Improved stability in multiplayer games

- Harder to use hacked planes in multiplayer games

- Reduction in swap file size

- Improved mission load times

- Improved performance throughout the user interface

The Crimson Skies Update version 1.02 requires DirectX 8.0 or later to play
multiplayer games on Zone.com. If you do not install DirectX 8 or later, a
warning is displayed every time you start a multiplayer game. You can download
DirectX from the following Microsoft Web site:

Crimson Skies Update Version 1.01
---------------------------------

The Crimson Skies Update version 1.01 fixes the following issue:

When you play a multiplayer game or when you customize a plane in Instant Action,
single player saved games may be inadvertently reset to the first mission.

After the saved games are reset, you cannot recover the lost mission state. You
must replay the campaign from the first mission.
