The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When one of the Exchange Server computers is down in a site that contains
multiple servers, and a message cannot be delivered, a non-delivery report (NDR)
may not be returned to the sender if the following conditions exist:

- The Exchange Server site contains more than two Exchange Server computers.

- The message is sent from one server to a recipient on another server.

- The recipient server's message transfer agent (MTA) is down.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the Exchange Server MTA service stops on one server, Exchange Server versions
4.0 and 5.0 return an NDR to the sender and delete the message from the MTA
queue when the message exceeds the retry limit and the retry intervals. This
behavior changes in Exchange Server 5.5; the MTA keeps trying to send the
message until the recipient server's MTA service is restarted.
