-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Sejin J-Mouse Keyboard drivers and restart the system,
your mouse no longer functions. The keyboard functions normally; however, the
enhanced features of the J-Mouse are not active.

CAUSE
=====

The version 4.0 drivers for the J-Mouse features of the Sejin J.M. Keyboard are
not compatible with Windows 95.

STATUS
======

At this time, no resolution for this problem is available. Sejin is aware of the
problem and is currently working on drivers that will be compatible with Windows
95.

Windows 95 includes a MouseKeys feature that allows users to perform mouse
actions using the numeric keypad. You can enable these features by pressing the
keyboard combination ALT+SHIFT+NUM LOCK. For more information about MouseKeys,
refer to Help.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The J-Mouse Keyboard has mouse capabilities built into the "J" key to enable
mouse movement from the keyboard. There are several other keys with mouse
functions assigned to them. These keys are designed to shorten the transition
time between the mouse and the keyboard. They also assist individuals with
movement disabilities, much the same as the accessibility features of Windows
95.

The products included here are manufactured by Sejin America, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
these products' performance or reliability.
