SUMMARY
=======

This article answers some commonly asked questions regarding directory
synchronization (Dir-Sync).

MORE INFORMATION
================

Questions and Answers
---------------------

1. When I create a user and exclude the user from Dir-Sync , the user's name
  still appears on the Global Address List (GAL) on that postoffice. Why? This
  is expected behavior. When a user is excluded from Dir-Sync, the user's
  address will not be propagated to other postoffices. However, the user will
  be visible to users on the postoffice that the user belongs to and will show
  up in the GAL on that postoffice.

2. Can I have more than one Dir-Sync server? No. Requestors can be registered
  with only one Dir-Sync server. Also, the Dir-Sync server cannot be registered
  as a requestor with another Dir-Sync server.

3. When I change the template file ADMIN.TPL, the updated template is not
  distributed to other postoffices. Why? When you change the template file
  ADMIN.TPL that contains the template definition, you must select Config,
  Dir-Sync, Requestor, Export command to distribute the updated template file
  to all postoffices.

4. Is a Config, Dir-Sync, Requestor, Export required when the template
  information stored in ADMIN.INF is modified through the Admin program or the
  Import process? No. Changes to ADMIN.INF are automatically distributed. For
  more information, please refer to page 160 of the version 3.2
  "Administrator's Guide."

5. Gateway addresses processed through Import are not being distributed to other
  postoffices. Why? For gateway addresses to propagate to all the postoffices
  participating in Dir-Sync, you should use Import with the -e option. Changes
  made through Admin or Import (without -e option) will not be distributed to
  other postoffices.

6. What if I have already imported the gateway addresses using Import without
  the -e option? You can use Import with the -x option to extract the
  addresses, and then use Import with -e option to get them into the Dir-Sync
  stream (REQTRANS.GLB).

7. Can extended information (templates) be imported for all gateway types? No.
  Extended information can be added only to gateways that conform to the
  10/10/10 addressing.


1. Dir-Sync appears to run without a hitch. However the number of entries in the
  GAL of each postoffice is different. Why? Variation in the number of entries
  in the GAL on each postoffice by itself is no cause for concern. Some
  possibilities are:

  a. Users excluded from Dir-Sync will be included in the GAL of the home
     postoffice but will not show up on the GAL of other postoffices.

  b. Not all postoffices may be requesting all types of addresses (for example,
     gateway addresses). This choice is available under Config, Dir- Sync,
     Requestor, Options, Types.

  c. Groups containing external users will not be propagated to other
     postoffices.

2. In the Windows client, when the GAL is the default address list, the Check
  names function returns an error although the address exists in the Global
  Address List. Why? A GAL rebuild problem manifests itself in the form of a
  Check names problem in the Windows client. There were some problems with
  Rebuild version 3.0.x that were fixed with Rebuild version 3.2.x.

3. Is there an easy way to monitor the success of the Dir-Sync process other
  than checking the logs on each postoffice and checking the sync numbers? Yes,
  on each postoffice, the administrator can add a user with a full name that
  reflects the current date, the network, and postoffice name (for example,
  Jul21 Network Postoffice). The administrator needs to modify the full name
  each day to reflect the current date. When this procedure is used, each
  administrator can log into the Windows client and do a Check Names on the
  current date, Jul21. This will bring up an entry for each postoffice that
  participated in Dir-Sync. The logs can be checked for those postoffices that
  did not participate in Dir-Sync.

  NOTE: This method introduces administrative overhead, (although Import can
  facilitate the process) and relies on the Administrator making the
  modification at each postoffice.

4. Which is the best place to begin troubleshooting Dir-Sync problems? The
  DISPATCH.LOG gives an indication of the return code for the Dir- Sync
  processes namely "NSDA -RT," "NSDA -S," and "NSDA -RR". The DIRSYNC.LOG on
  each postoffice provides more detailed information.

5. When EXTERNAL is run as an idle process of Dispatch, is it necessary to
  specify break parameters for External? No. Dispatch appends a break relative
  time to the idle process command line automatically.

6. With version 3.2 of Dispatch, I am unable to run Dispatch, External, and
  Schdist from the same machine. Why? With version 3.3 and 6.x of MS-DOS, this
  will work provided that COMMAND.COM is copied to the same directory where the
  dispatch executables reside. For additional information, please see the
  following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q101752 PC Ext: Dispatch Cannot Spawn Batch File Without COMMAND.COM

7. Can I run more than one Dispatch process per postoffice? No, only one
  Dispatch process should be run against a postoffice.

8. The Dir-Sync times change around Daylight Savings Time (DST). How can this be
  changed? When a Dir-Sync process runs, it is rescheduled to run a week later
  at the same time. If the rescheduled time falls after a DST change, the
  process time is changed. The administrator has to manually change the process
  times on each postoffice after the DST change has been effected.

9. What is the proper usage for the TZ variable? Please refer to the following
  article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q101753 PC DirSync: When to Use the Time Zone Option with Dir-Sync

10. Is there any way to restrict gateway addresses from showing up in the Global
  Address List? No. Rebuild will process all the addresses available in the
  mail database (postoffice) into the Global Address List.

11. Does Dispatch or one of the Dir-Sync agents that Dispatch spawns transfer
  the Dir-Sync mail between postoffices? No. Dispatch creates Dir-Sync mail
  messages, but External is the agent that transfers the message between
  postoffices.

12. Can a foreign mail system participate in Dir-Sync? Yes, to participate in
  Dir-Sync, the foreign mail system should create a foreign requestor. The
  Dir-Sync process considers the foreign requestor as a requestor postoffice.
  For more information, please obtain the "Directory Synchronization with
  Foreign Mail Systems" guide (part number 34524) from the Microsoft Sales and
  Information Center at (800) 426-9400.

13. Are the Dir-Sync executables bound applications? NOTE: Bound applications
  are designed and built so that they can be run under either OS/2 or MS-DOS.
  All Dir-Sync files, except DISPATCH.EXE, are bound executables. The bound
  executables run on both OS/2 and MS-DOS.

14. Where can I find more information about Dir-Sync? You can refer to the
  Microsoft Mail "Administrator's Guide." There is also a document, "Directory
  Synchronization (Dir-Sync)" that covers the Dir-Sync process in depth. You
  can obtain this document from the following sources:
