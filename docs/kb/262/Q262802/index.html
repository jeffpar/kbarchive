-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The time or date on an Exchange Server-based computer may be off by several
hours.

CAUSE
=====

This can occur if the Server Monitor utility is running against a server or
servers and the Synchronize check box is selected on the Clock tab of the Server
Monitor properties (on the servers and the monitoring server).

To verify that this as a possible cause:

1. Start the Exchange Administrator utility, and then connect to an Exchange
  Server-based computer.

2. Expand the site that has the server with the time variance.

3. Expand the Configuration container under the site.

4. Click the Monitors container under the Configuration container.

5. If you have monitors listed in the Administrator window, double-click the
  monitor, click Properties, and then click the Clock tab. Repeat this step for
  each monitor.

If Synchronize is selected, the time for the Exchange Server-based computer is
synchronized with the time for the monitoring workstation.

If the monitoring workstation is not set at the correct local time and is set to
synchronize, the monitor causes the time on the Exchange Server-based computer
to change to the time of the workstation.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent the Server Monitor utility from changing the time on the Exchange
Server-based computer, either click to clear the Synchronize check box on the
Clock tab in the Server Monitor properties, or verify that all monitoring
workstations are set to their correct local time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Synchronize option takes into account variances with time zone differences
and only adjusts the time on the Exchange Server-based computer if there is an
incorrect time for the monitoring workstation.

For example, if you have a workstation that is in the Eastern Time Zone
(Greenwich Mean Time minus 5 hours) monitoring an Exchange Server that resides
in the Pacific Time Zone (Greenwich Mean Time minus 8 hours), the monitor does
not adjust the time of the Exchange Server-based computer to that of the
monitoring workstation if the time is correct on the monitoring workstation.
