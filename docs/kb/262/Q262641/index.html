The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Motocross Madness 2, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the new Ghost Race feature of Microsoft Motocross Madness
2. In a Ghost Race, a player races against their best time on any track in a
Baha, Enduro, National, or Supercross race.

How to Record a Ghost Race Lap
------------------------------

1. On the Motocross Madness 2 startup screen, click Single Player (the helmet
  icon).

2. Click the race event type that you want to run.

3. In the Race Mode box, click Ghost Race.

4. In the box below the name of the track and the illustration of the terrain,
  click "Record a new ghost race".

5. Click the checkered flag icon to start the race.

6. When you are finished or satisfied with your latest Ghost Race lap, press the
  ESC key.

7. Click Quit Event. When you are prompted to save the current ghost lap, click
  Yes. The ghost race lap is saved with a date and time stamp.

NOTE: In a Supercross race, you must run an initial lap to warm up before the
timer is started for the ghost race. As a result, you run two laps before your
ghost rider appears.

How to Race Against a Saved Ghost Race Lap
------------------------------------------

1. On the Motocross Madness 2 startup screen, click Single Player (the helmet
  icon).

2. Click the race event type that you want to run.

3. In the Race Mode box, click Ghost Race.

4. In the box below the name of the track and the illustration of the terrain,
  click the ghost lap that you want to race against.

5. Click the checkered flag to start the race.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The ghost rider competes against your current lap taking the exact same route
and time from the ghost lap. When you defeat the ghost rider, the winning route
and time automatically replace the route and time that you were racing against.

NOTE: To share your ghost lap files with another player, copy the ghost lap
(.gho) files from the Record folder in the Motocross Madness 2 installation
folder, and then send the files to the other player.

The other player can paste the ghost lap files into the Record folder in their
Motocross Madness 2 installation folder, and then race against the ghost riders
that you recorded.
