IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When logon points are shared by multiple sites and one domain is removed from
logon installation and logon discovery, Logon Server Manager (LSM) tries to
remove the site from the logon points. This succeeds, but the domain entry in
the site server registry and site control file are not updated and removed.
Because of this, Logon Server Manager (from that site) continues to try to
connect to the primary domain controller (PDC) of the appropriate domain during
each scheduled update interval and repeatedly tries to uninstall.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this problem, delete the domain in the following site server
registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft/SMS/Components/SMS NT Logon Server
  Manager/Domains

After the registry key is removed, the entry is removed from the site control
file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Excessive network traffic and site server processing are experienced as each
site that wants to remove the domain continues to retry during each logon point
update cycle. By default, this occurs once per day. Logon Server Manager
connects to each domain controller in the target domain during each update cycle
whether or not it is the senior site. Networks with hundreds or even thousands
of domain controllers, many of which are using slow connections, are the most
effected. The only way for this cycle to end normally is when all sites have
removed the domain. When this occurs, each site completely removes the domain
from its site and never tries to connect to it again. This happens for senior
sites as well as junior sites.
