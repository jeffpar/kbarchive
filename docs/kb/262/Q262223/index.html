SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience problems when you schedule the Delprof.exe utility to run by
using the AT command (also known as the Schedule service). When you do so, the
targeted profile folders are not deleted from the %SystemRoot%\Profiles folder.
However, users with existing profiles are logged on with a new default profile,
or a new copy of their roaming profile with a &lt;Username&gt;.00&lt;x&gt; file
name.

CAUSE
=====

By default, the Schedule service runs under the Local System account. The Local
System account does not have network privileges. Delprof cannot perform its
tasks correctly when it is running under the Local System account.

RESOLUTION
==========

Reconfigure the Schedule service to run under a user account with administrator
privileges on the local computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is actually a limitation of the Local System account. Because Delprof.exe
is network-aware, it is designed to make a network connection to the computer on
which it is deleting profiles, even if that is the local computer. It does so by
making a connection to the Admin$ share on the computer. The Local System
account has no permissions to access the computer by using this method.

However, the second function of Delprof.exe is to delete the appropriate user's
entry in the registry at:

  Hkey_Local_Machine\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList

This second function does not require a network connection when it is run on the
local computer, and succeeds. The files for the profile are left on the server,
but the pointer needed to link the user to the profile is deleted. Therefore,
the user receives a new profile.
