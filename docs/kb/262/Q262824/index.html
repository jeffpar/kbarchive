The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you advertise a program that is based on a mandatory assignment to a client
and you use the "Allow users to run the program independently of assignments""
option, the program may be run twice. This problem may occur if the Advertised
Programs client agent is configured to display a notification message when new
advertised programs are available.

For example, this problem occurs in the following scenario:

The Offer Data Providers (ODPs) on the client refresh the offers and determine
that a new advertisement is available. A notification appears to inform the user
that a new advertised program is available. However, the user is away from the
computer. The advertised program is mandatory, so Advertised Program Manager
(APM) schedules the program to run at the appropriate time. The scheduled run
time occurs before the user returns to the computer and APM runs the program.
However, the notification remains visible.

The user returns and sees the notification. The user is not aware that the
program has already been run, so the user clicks Yes to run the new advertised
program. This displays the Advertised Programs Wizard, which displays in bold
text the advertised program that has already run. The bold text typically
indicates that the program has not been run. The Last Run field in the program's
properties indicates that the program has already been run, but the user may not
notice this field.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q288239 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, users can check the Last Run field to determine if
a program has already been run.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you apply Service Pack 4 (SP4):

- The Advertised Programs Wizard does not use bold text to display a program
  that has already been run.

- The New Advertised Program Available notification dialog box is automatically
  closed when all advertisements have been addressed either by the user or by a
  mandatory program being run.
