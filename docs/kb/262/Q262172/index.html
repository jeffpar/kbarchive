-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Allegiance, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you fly in Microsoft Allegiance, your vehicle may start to roll and rotate
uncontrollably when you use the throttle on your joystick.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you use an analog three-axis joystick as your game
controller.

By default, Allegiance maps the third axis of a game controller to the rotation
function instead of the acceleration and deceleration functions that are
expected of a throttle.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, contact your game controller manufacturer to inquire
about how to obtain and install the latest version of the driver for your game
controller.

For information about how to contact your game controller manufacturer, click the
appropriate article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q60781 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, L-P

  Q60782 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, Q-Z

If the issue continues to occur, map the third axis of your joystick to the
throttle within the game:

1. Start Allegiance.

2. On the startup screen, click Options.

3. Point to Game Options.

4. Click "Map Keys and Controls".

5. Scroll to the bottom of the Configure Controls dialog box.

6. Under Joystick, click Throttle, and then press ENTER.

7. Move the throttle on your joystick to map the third axis of the joystick to
  the throttle.

  NOTE: If the control assignment changes to three exclamation marks (!!!) and
  you receive a message that stating that the control is already assigned to a
  different action, press ENTER to confirm the new assignment.

8. Click Accept to return to the startup screen.
