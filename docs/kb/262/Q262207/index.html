The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Allegiance, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Allegiance, a player who has been accepted into a Squad game may
continue to receive a message stating that they are not a member of a Squad. As
a result, the player is unable to join the Squad game.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because Squad membership data is not stored on the
Allegiance game server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, quit Allegiance, restart Allegiance, and then join the
Squad game.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you quit and then restart Allegiance, the game checks with the Squad server
to determine who is eligible to play in the Squad game.
