SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the enhancement (cheat) code in Microsoft StarLancer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

StarLancer includes only one cheat code. You can use this code to play any
mission or select any ship that you want to fly in a mission.

NOTE: When you use the cheat code in StarLancer, the game erases your current
pilot statistics, including your kill record, your medals, your earned rank,
etc. If you want to use the cheat code, create a new pilot, and then use the
cheat code only with that pilot.

To use a ship that is normally available for the mission that you select:

1. On the StarLancer startup screen, follow the instructions on the screen to
  start the game.

2. After you enter the Bunkroom area, press the ESC key to return to the
  StarLancer startup screen.

3. On the StarLancer startup screen, press and hold down the CTRL key while you
  type "potato" (without the quotation marks).

4. When the red mission indicator appears in the upper-left corner of the screen
  ("M1" indicates that Mission 1 is selected), type the number for the mission
  that you want to play. The mission indicator is updated automatically when
  you type a new mission number.

  NOTE: There are 24 missions in StarLancer. To select Missions 1 through 9,
  type the mission number with a leading zero. For example, to select Mission
  7, type "07" (without the quotation marks).

5. Press the CTRL+ENTER key combination to move directly to the Briefing Room,
  and then select your ship.

To use any ship that is available in the game:

1. On the StarLancer startup screen, press and hold down the CTRL key while you
  type "potato" (without the quotation marks).

2. When the red mission indicator appears in the upper-left corner of the screen
  ("M1" indicates that Mission 1 is selected), type the number for the mission
  that you want to play. The mission indicator is updated automatically when
  you type a new mission number.

  NOTE: There are 24 missions in StarLancer. To select Missions 1 through 9,
  type the mission number with a leading zero. For example, to select Mission
  7, type "07" (without the quotation marks).

3. Press and hold down the SHIFT key while you press the appropriate function
  key to select the ship that you want to fly during the mission.

  NOTE: The mission begins after you select your ship.

The following table lists the function keys for each of the ships in the game.
