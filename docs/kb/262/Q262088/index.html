SUMMARY
=======

You can use the "Show Desktop feature" included with the versions of Windows
listed above to minimize or restore all of your open programs, and easily view
the desktop. To use this feature, click Show Desktop on the Quicklaunch toolbar
on the right-side of the taskbar.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To view the Show Desktop button if you are running a full-screen program such as
a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation in Slide Show mode, you can press the
Windows key or press CTRL+ESC. When you click Show Desktop, your programs are
all minimized or restored, depending on their current state.

NOTE: In Windows 2000 Professional, the programs that are running may be returned
in reverse order. This means that the program that was previously in the
foreground, returns behind programs that were previously behind it.


NOTE: If the Show Desktop icon is missing, and the Show Desktop.scf file is
present in the Windows\System, or WINNT\System32 folder, you can add it to the
Quick Launch Bar by performing the following steps:

- Click Start/ Find /Files or Folders, or Start/ Search /For Files or Folders
  and seacrh for *.scf.

- Drag the Show Desktop file from the c:\windows\system folder to the quick
  lanch bar to create a shortcut for it there.

NOTE: If the Show Desktop icon is missing from the Quick Launch Bar, you can
recreate it by following this article:
