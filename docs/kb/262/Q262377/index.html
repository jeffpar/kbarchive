SYMPTOMS
========

When you restart a computer running SNA Server, the SNABase service or SNAServer
service may fail to start with the following Event ID:

  Event Type:	Error
  Event Source:	Service Control Manager
  Event Category:	None
  Event ID:	7000
  Date:		5/8/2000
  Time:		3:07:21 AM
  User:		N/A
  Computer:       &lt;servername&gt;
  Description:
  The SnaServer service failed to start due to the following error: 
  The service did not start due to a logon failure.  

When you attempt to start the services manually in Control Panel Services, one of
the following error messages may occur:

  Could not start the SNABase service on this local computer.
  Error 2140: An Internal Windows NT error occurred.

  Could not start the SNABase service on this local computer.
  Error 1069: The service did not start due to logon failure.

  Could not start the SNAServer service on this local computer.
  Error 1069: The service did not start due to logon failure.

CAUSE
=====

When you install SNA Server, a domain system account is created that is used by
the SNA Server services to gain authority to start. Since the time when the
account was created, the following scenarios may have occurred to cause this
problem:

- The domain system account no longer exists in the domain specified in the SNA
  Server service startup properties.

- The password has been changed for the SNA Server service domain system
  account.

- The SNA Server service domain account resides in a separate domain that is a
  trusted domain of the current domain where the SNA Server system resides. The
  trust relationship between these two domains is currently broken.

- The user rights for the SNA Server service domain system account have been
  altered.

RESOLUTION
==========

The causes described in the previous section are Windows NT domain account
issues and need to be resolved by the Windows NT Domain administrator. Please
see the "More Information" section for specifics on the SNA Server domain system
account requirements.

WORKAROUND
==========

In Control Panel Services, configure the SNA Server services that are using a
domain system account to use the local System Account. This allows the services
to be stopped and started with authentication by the Local System Account (LSA)
authority.

NOTE: Remote management from the SNA Server Manager or the SNA Server Microsoft
Management Console (MMC) snap-in is hindered by using this workaround. SNA
Server remote management requires a domain system account that uses the Windows
NTLM Security Support Provider (NTLMSSP) authority. Also, the SNA Server Print
service may require NTLMSP to print to remote printer queues.

MORE INFORMATION
================

During the installation of SNA Server is when the SNA domain system account can
be created. This account has Domain Admin rights and Advanced User rights both.
For full functionality of the SNA Server services and resources, the following
Advanced User rights must be granted to the SNA Server domain system account to
allow the SNA Server services to log on outside of the Domain Admin group:

   - Act as part of the Operating System

- Logon as a Service

- Generate Security Audits

- Load and Unload Device Drivers

- Manage Audit and Security Log

Also, it is recommended that the SNA Server domain system account is a member of
the Domain Admin group. The password is set to never expire, and is available
during all hours.
