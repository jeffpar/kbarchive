-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Microsoft Windows 95-based client attempts to connect to a Windows
NT-based server using encryption, the client may receive the following error
message:

  No domain server was available to validate your password. You may not be able
  to gain access to some network resources.

The following event ID may also appear in the event log:

  Event ID: 8006
  Description: The browser has received an illegal datagram from the remote
  computer "&lt;Windows 95 client name&gt;" to name "&lt;Server name&gt;" on
  transport "&lt;Transport name&gt;". The data is the datagram.

If the Enable Encryption check box is selected for the Windows 95-based client
connection, the problem does not occur.

CAUSE
=====

Under certain circumstances, Windows NT and Windows 95 may lose synchronization
when you are using encryption. This causes the client and the server to use
different keys.
