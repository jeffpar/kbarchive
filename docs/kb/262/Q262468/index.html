-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to run the Distribute Software Wizard, you may receive an error
that states that there are insufficient rights to run the wizard. This will
occur even if you have all of the INSTANCE level rights on the Collection class.

CAUSE
=====

The Distribute Software Wizard in Systems Management Server (SMS) checks CLASS
level permissions only. Without adding CLASS level permissions on the Collection
class to your user account, there is no method to enable you to use the Software
Distribution Wizard.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, you can create an advertisement manually. In order to
advertise to a Collection, as the logged-on user, you must have the advertise
INSTANCE right for a collection. Once the you obtain the INSTANCE level right,
then it is possible to manually create an advertisement for objects of a
collection.

To follow the steps to manually create an advertisement, refer to the SMS
administrators' guide, on page 417, "Use the SMS Administrators Console."

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This issue becomes apparent when an SMS administrator attempts to limit the
scope of ability for other administrators. More specifically, when you (as an
administrator) attempt to limit the collections that an administrator can
advertise to, you experience this issue.

Another issue that may be encountered is on a user's ability to advertise to a
collection that they created if the user only had INSTANCE level rights on
specific collections. The result is that after creating the new collection, the
user is unable to advertise to the collection that was just created because
INSTANCE level permissions are not inherited from other collections. Thus, an
administrator with CLASS level permissions to the new collection must grant the
creator the INSTANCE level Advertise right.
