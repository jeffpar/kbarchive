SUMMARY
=======

The Event.exe sample Windows 2000 device driver demonstrates how to set a
user-mode event in a kernel-mode driver. This sample driver uses a Win32
application that creates an event object and passes the handles to the driver by
using a private I/O control (IOCTL). The driver dereferences the user-mode
handle into system space and sets the event at the given interval.

The instructions that are given in this article for building and installing the
driver apply only to Windows 2000.

NOTE: This sample provides an example of a minimal driver. Neither the driver nor
the sample programs are intended for use in a production environment. Rather,
they are intended for educational purposes and as a skeleton driver.

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

Building the Sample
-------------------

Use the following steps to build the sample:

1. Click the Free Build Environment or Checked Build Environment icon in your
  Development Kits program group to set basic environment variables that are
  needed by the build utility.

2. Change to the folder that contains the device source code, by using a command
  such as "CD C:\Drivers\Event" (without the quotation marks).

3. Run "build -ceZ" (without the quotation marks) or use the BLD macro.

This process invokes the Microsoft make routines that produce .log files
(Buildxxx.log) and also Buildxxx.wrn and Buildxxx.err, if there are any warnings
or errors, where xxx stands for .fre or .chk, depending on the environment
chosen.

If the build succeeds, the Event.sys driver and the test application program,
Eventtst.exe, will be placed in a platform-specific subfolder in your
%TargetPath% folder that is specified in the Sources file.

Installing the Sample
---------------------

To install the driver:

1. Double-click the Add/Remove Hardware application in Control Panel.

2. Click to select Add/Troubleshoot a device.

3. Click to select Add a new device. Click Next.

4. Select to select No, I want to select the hardware from a list. Click Next.

5. Click to select Other devices, and then click Next.

6. Click Have Disk and point to the folder that contains the Event.inf file.

The system will copy the Event.sys file to the %Systemroot%\System32\Drivers
folder and load the driver.

Configuring the Event Driver
----------------------------

The Event driver debug parameters can be configured by using the registry. The
Event.inf file contains the default values for all the configurable parameters.
A brief description of each parameter follows:

  

  BreakOnEntry       REG_DWORD   0

This is a Boolean value, which determines whether a break point will be generated
during the DriverEntry routine. It has no effect in a free build of the driver.

  

  DebugLevel          REG_DWORD   0

This value specifies the level of diagnostic messages produced. Larger values
result in more verbose messages. It can take values from 0 to 3. It has no
effect in a free build of the driver.

  

  DebugComp          REG_DWORD   0xFFFFFFFF

This value specifies the components in which the debug messages are printed. Each
bit specifies the component. See Debug.h for a component list. It has no effect
in a free build of the driver.

The Event.exe file contains the following files:

File          Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Event.c       Source file for the Event sample driver.
Pnp.c         Source file that handles the PnP IRPs.

Common.h      Include file that contains the command definition for the
             driver and application.
Eventtst.c    Source file for the test application.
Sources       Generic file for building the code sample.
Makefile      Standard Windows 2000 makefile.
Event.inf     Installation file for installing the driver.
