SUMMARY
=======

The process that Systems Management Server (SMS) clients use for upgrading to a
new service pack has changed in SMS 2.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2).

For additional information on how to obtain the latest Systems Management Server
2.0 service pack, click the article number below to view the article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

MORE INFORMATION
================

Clients that are assigned to SMS sites do not receive a significantly new
version of the Clicore file by using the logon scripts or Smsman. For example,
if a client with version 2.00.1380.0000 logs on to a logon point that has
version 2.00.1999.2000 of the Clicore file, Boot32wn quits without copying the
new Clicore file, and without running the new Clicore file on the client.
Hotfixes are not defined as a "significant" new version (for example, a logon
script can run Clicore version 2.00.1999.2001 against a client with version
2.00.1999.2000).

Also, new clients are not assigned to significantly earlier sites that
participate on the logon point. For example, if site A runs Service Pack 1
(SP1), site B runs SP2, and they both share a logon point, clients that log on
to that logon point are only assigned to site B. This prevents new clients from
getting the new Clicore file and then being assigned to an earlier site
(preventing clients from having an SP2 Clicore file with SP1 components).

A client is correctly upgraded when its Client Configuration and Installation
Manager (CCIM) maintenance cycle runs and reads information from the Client
Access Point (CAP).
