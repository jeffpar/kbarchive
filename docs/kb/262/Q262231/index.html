SUMMARY
=======

Prior to Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Service Pack 2, you could not
install an SMS site server on a server with Microsoft Windows 2000 Terminal
Server installed.

With Service Pack 2 or later, you are now able to install an SMS primary site, or
secondary site on a server with Windows 2000 Terminal Server installed. This
capability does not include support for Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0,
Terminal Server Edition.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you configure Terminal Services for Application Server mode, it is necessary
to place the server in Install mode prior to running SMS Setup. To accomplish
this, simply start the SMS Setup program from the Add/Remove Programs tool in
Control Panel, or use the "change user" command from the command prompt. Because
of this, you cannot install a secondary site in Application Server mode, on a
server with Windows 2000 Terminal Server installed, by initiating the
installation from the primary site. In this situation, you must install the
secondary site directly from an SMS installation location.

If you configured Terminal Services for Remote Administration mode, it is not
necessary to take any additional steps to configure the server prior to
installing the site server.

Prior to installing a new site server, it might be necessary to prepare the SMS
installation files by updating them with the SMS service pack files. See the
Readme.1st file that is supplied with the SMS service pack for more details.

For more information about the supported features on a system that is running
Terminal Services, please see the following Microsoft Web site:
