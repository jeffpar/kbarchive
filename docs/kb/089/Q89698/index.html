-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may get the following message when trying to run Windows version 3.0 in 386
enhanced mode:

  You must have the file WINA20.386 in the root of your boot drive to run
  Windows in enhanced mode

CAUSE
=====

WINA20.386 is a file included in compressed format with MS-DOS version 5.0. The
compressed filename is WINA20.38_. It should be copied to the root directory
during the MS-DOS 5.0 installation/upgrade. If it is not, you will receive this
message.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use this procedure to reinstall the WINA20.386 file:

1. Insert MS-DOS 5.0 Disk 3 (for 3.5-inch disks) or Disk 5 (for 5.25-inch disks)
  into drive A or B.

2. Use the EXPAND.EXE utility provided with MS-DOS 5.0. From the root directory
  type the following:

  expand a:\wina20.38_ c:\wina20.386

  NOTE: You must use the EXPAND.EXE utility provided with MS-DOS 5.0. If
  EXPAND.EXE is not in the DOS directory, do the following:

  a. Insert MS-DOS 5.0 Disk 3 (for 3.5-inch disks) or Disk 6 (for 5.25-inch
     disks) into drive A or B.

  b. Change to drive A or B.

  c. Type the following:

  copy expand.exe c:\expand.exe

  d. Change back to drive C and follow the above instructions.

3. Start Windows (you do not need to reboot).

Moving WINA20.386 Out of Root Directory
---------------------------------------

If the WINA20.386 file is in a different directory, do the following:

1. Add a SWITCHES=/W command to your CONFIG.SYS file.

2. Add the following line to the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI file:

  DEVICE=&lt;&lt;drive:&gt;&lt;path&gt;&gt; WINA20.386

  where &lt;&lt;drive:&gt;&lt;path&gt;&gt; refers to the drive and path where
  the WINA20.386 file is located.

QEMM and Windows 3.1
--------------------

Using a version of Quarterdeck QEMM386 earlier than 6.0 with the NOEMS switch
causes a message to appear when starting Windows 3.1. Windows is able to run in
all modes, but a message is displayed stating that the WINA20.386 file could not
be found.

This behavior is caused in part by measures taken to work with earlier versions
of QEMM. When Windows starts, it sends two version messages, one saying that it
is version 3.0, and another saying it is version 3.1. When MS-DOS 5.0 intercepts
the 3.0 message, it immediately checks for the existence of the WINA20.386 file.
MS-DOS does not need this file if you are running Windows version 3.1.

The following are methods to prevent the WINA20.386 error message from being
displayed:

- Upgrade QEMM to the latest version (6.0 or later).

- Add the following line to the CONFIG.SYS file:

  switches=/w
