The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows for Workgroups (WFWG) enables you to connect to and use files,
directories, and printers that are shared on a Microsoft LAN Manager server. In
addition, if you use LAN Manager, you can connect to and use the resources
shared on Windows for Workgroups machines.

To browse a LAN Manager server appearing in the Windows for Workgroups Connect
Network and Connect Network Printers dialog boxes, at least one computer on the
network must have a Workgroup name that matches the name of the primary domain
of the LAN Manager server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use Control Panel to set options for LAN Manager. Options include logging onto a
LAN Manager domain when logging into Windows for Workgroups, and changing
passwords for various LAN Manager servers and domains. (Logon scripts run when
your LAN Manager password is validated by the logon server.)

Setting LAN Manager Options
---------------------------

To set LAN Manager options, do the following:

1. In the Control Panel window, double-click the Network icon, or use the arrow
  keys to select the Network icon, and then press ENTER.

2. Choose the Networks button.

3. If Microsoft LAN Manager appears in the Other Networks In Use list, select it
  and then choose the Settings button.

  If Microsoft LAN Manager is not in the Other Networks In Use list select it
  and then choose the Add button. If a dialog box appears asking you to insert
  a disk, insert the disk and choose the OK button. Then choose the Settings
  button in the Network Settings dialog box.

4. If you want to log on to a LAN Manager domain when you log on to Windows for
  Workgroups, select the Log On To LAN Manager Domain check box and then type
  the name of the domain you want to log on to in the Domain Name box.

5. If you want to change your passwords for LAN Manager servers or domains,
  choose the Set Password button.

6. In the LAN Manager Settings dialog box, choose the OK button.

7. In the Compatible Networks dialog box, choose the OK button.

8. In the Network Settings dialog box, choose the OK button.

A message appears prompting you to restart Windows. Choose the Restart Windows
button for your changes to take effect.

If you select the Log On To LAN Manager Domain option when you start Windows for
Workgroups, a dialog box appears asking you to type your password for the
domain. (You can also specify a different domain to log on to.) If you do not
want to be prompted for your domain password eac h time you start Windows for
Workgroups, select the Save This Password In Your Password List check box.

NOTE: You can also use the LMAnnounce= parameter if you have existing LAN Manager
clients that need to see a WFWG server (for example, a print server) in the
server lists under Windows or from the NET VIEW command.
