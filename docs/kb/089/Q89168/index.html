-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to install updated sound card drivers in Windows, you may receive the
following error message:

  These drivers require a newer version of Windows 3.1

CAUSE
=====

This error message occurs under the following circumstances:

- You attempt to add updated sound card drivers designed for Windows 3.1 to
  Windows 3.0 with multimedia extensions.

- You have installed both Norton Desktop for Windows and Berkeley System's
  After Dark screen saver on Windows 3.1. Norton Desktop and After Dark add
  virtual device drivers (VxDs) in the [386ENH] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.
  These drivers can cause the error message to occur.

- You have a tape drive, SCSI drive, or other hardware device installed on the
  system, and that device is using the same DMA channel as the sound card.

WORKAROUND
==========

Troubleshooting Steps
---------------------

To correct this problem, follow these troubleshooting steps:

1. If this error message occurs under Windows 3.0, install the drivers that were
  provided by the manufacturer for use with the Windows 3.0 multimedia
  extensions, or check with the manufacturer to make sure that the drivers were
  intended to be used with Windows 3.0.

2. Make sure that no terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs or device
  drivers are loading in the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files that may be
  conflicting with Windows. For more information, query on "clean boot" in the
  Knowledge Base.

3. Run Windows in standard mode (use the WIN /S command), then try installing
  the drivers for the sound card.

4. If the problem still occurs in standard mode, make sure there is no conflict
  between the sound card and another hardware device. For more information on
  configuring the sound card, consult the manufacturer.

5. If there is no hardware conflict, try reinstalling Windows 3.1 into a new
  directory. Make sure that no third-party applications (for example, Norton
  Desktop or After Dark) are installed on top of Windows. Then try adding the
  drivers for the sound card.

Norton Desktop for Windows and Berkeley Systems' After Dark are manufactured by
vendors independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
regarding these products' performance or reliability.
