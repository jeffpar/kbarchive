-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses conditions that may cause Windows to hang when a Banyan
Vines 3270 program is run. The following topics are included:

- NEWREV 1W patch causes Windows to hang

- Banyan Vines 3270/RA 3270 hangs because of login script

- Windows 3.0 and 3270 with Banyan Mail

MORE INFORMATION
================

NEWREV 1W Patch Causes Windows to Hang
--------------------------------------

After the server software has been updated with the addition of the NEWREV 1W
patch, network clients accessing 3270 services under Windows may experience
problems with their computers' locking, according to Banyan.

Note: There is no workaround for this problem other than removing the patch and
going back to a former revision level.

Banyan Vines 3270/RA 3270 Hangs Because of Login Script
-------------------------------------------------------

Banyan Vines 3270/RA 3270 may not function correctly after an invalid login
statement under Vines 4.0. The following causes the problem:

1. Choose the MS-DOS icon in Windows.

2. Execute the 3270 command. You receive a host screen.

3. Request the Time Sharing Operation (TSO). You will receive a Login dialog
  box.

4. Enter an invalid name/password combination for the 3270 connection. You
  receive an invalid name/password message.

5. Before the screen is updated, press ALT+TAB to switch back to the Windows
  environment. The system hangs and the computer has to be turned off and
  restarted. (Pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL does not work.)

  Note: There is no workaround for this problem.

Windows 3.0 and 3270 with Banyan Mail
-------------------------------------

To run Banyan Mail and 3270 Terminal Emulation simultaneously under Windows 3.0,
do the following:

1. Place the command

  Z:\SETMSGS OFF

  in the Banyan start up batch file anywhere after the LOGIN command. Replace
  Z:\ with the path to the SETMSGS command if necessary. If this command is not
  used, and a network broadcast message appears, the 3270 communications link
  may be broken.

2. Start Banyan Vines and log on before entering Windows.

3. Set the PIF for the 3270 Terminal Emulator session for Background and Full
  Screen.

4. Set the PIF for Banyan Mail to run full screen with neither Background nor
  Exclusive selected.
