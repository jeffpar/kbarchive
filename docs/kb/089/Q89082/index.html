-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Sitka TOPS is not a supported network by Microsoft Windows; however, it may be
possible to run Windows on the Sitka TOPS network. This article discusses the
following:

- Setup issues for Sitka TOPS with Windows

- Software issues when running Sitka TOPS with Windows

- Hardware issues when running Sitka TOPS with Windows

SETUP ISSUES FOR SITKA TOPS WITH WINDOWS
----------------------------------------

On a Sitka TOPS network, programs cannot be executed from the server. Therefore,
it is not possible to perform a network installation of Windows 3.0 by running
SETUP /N, or Windows 3.1 by running SETUP /A and SETUP /N.

Workaround
----------

Set up Windows on the local hard drive.

SOFTWARE ISSUES WHEN RUNNING SITKA TOPS WITH WINDOWS
----------------------------------------------------

Network Connections
-------------------

Any network connections (file servers, print servers, or network devices)
established before starting Windows are not recognized from within Windows
version 3.0, 3.0a, or 3.1. In general, those connections are available if you
exit Windows. You should always load Sitka NetPrint before starting Windows. For
more information on this limitation, contact Sitka TOPS technical support.

Network Printing
----------------

Sitka does NOT recommend that you configure TOPS/DOS as a file server or print
server when using TOPS/DOS in the Windows 3.0 environment. Configure TOPS/DOS as
a Network Printer Client, Remote Printer Client or File Client only. You must
edit the TOPS.DAT file to increase the "Max number of open files" setting
(listed under the File Client parameters) to at least 20. If you receive an
error message indicating that your application "can't find a .TMP file, insert
disk in drive A," try setting the MS-DOS SET TEMP variable in the AUTOEXEC.BAT
file to the remote drive letter.

Loading TOPS/DOS or NetPrint in conventional memory and Windows in standard mode
should work in most cases. You will not be able to run TOPS/DOS in extended
memory while Windows is running in 386 enhanced mode. The MS-DOS extender
program that TOPS/DOS 3.0 uses for extended memory is not compatible with the
Windows.

For more information about printing on the Sitka TOPS network, query on the
following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  UNIX and CTRLD and TOPS

HARDWARE ISSUES WHEN RUNNING SITKA TOPS WITH WINDOWS
----------------------------------------------------

For the best results, use a TOPS-supported Ethernet card. With Windows in
enhanced mode, and to a lesser extent in standard mode, a TOPS FlashCard is not
serviced often enough to maintain network connections. The operation of the TOPS
FlashCard and driver is dependent upon standard servicing of hardware
interrupts. If you want to try using a FlashCard, make sure that you configure
the card and driver for DMA=NONE and BOARDINT=3. Also, be advised that network
activity may only work intermittently.
