SUMMARY
=======

Novell recommends mapping drives and setting a path on a Novell Network by:

1. Using the Map Root command to map each drive.

2. Using the MS-DOS SET PATH command to set a MS-DOS path variable to avoid
  having the path overwritten by the login script.

  You can also avoid this problem as follows:

   - Configure your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to log you onto the network and then
     execute the MS-DOS PATH statement.

     -or-

   - Log on manually after the AUTOEXEC.BAT file and then run a batch (.BAT)
     file after logging on to restore the path.

Using this method resolves pathing problems with a search drive.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Map Root
--------

The Map Root command is an addition to the Map command in version 3.01 of the
Novell NetWare shell. It allows directories to be mapped as the root of a
logical drive, making it impossible to change the directory to a parent
directory. The Map Root command is used with the same syntax as the Map command
(see below).

MS-DOS SET PATH
---------------

The MS-DOS SET PATH command is used in Novell to define an MS-DOS variable in
memory. By using the MS-DOS SET PATH command, an MS-DOS-type path variable is
created that will be easier to use than a Novell search drive. Novell requires
that the path variable be placed in quotation marks and that a backslash (\) be
preceded by a backslash (that is, \\) to be properly recognized (see below).

This variable has the same limitations as a variable set from MS-DOS. A shell
command may be required in the CONFIG.SYS file to provide enough environment
space, and the variable may not exceed 128 characters.

A Sample Login Script
---------------------

In the following sample, COUNT is the name of the server and the paths being
mapped are:

- F:\PUBLIC A public directory

- F:\USER\JOHN\WIN31 The Windows user's directory

- F:\USER\JOHN The user's directory

- F:\WIN31 The shared Windows directory

     MAP ROOT F: = COUNT\SYS:\PUBLIC
     MAP ROOT S: = COUNT\SYS:\USER\JOHN\WIN31
     MAP ROOT U: = COUNT\SYS:\USER\JOHN
     MAP ROOT W: = COUNT\SYS:\WIN31
     COMSPEC = C:\COMMAND.COM
     DRIVE S:
     DOS SET PATH = "C:\\;C:\\DOS;F:\\;S:\\;U:\\;W:\\;"

Using this Login script returns a path variable similar to the one below when the
Set command is issued:

    path C:\;C:\DOS;F:\;S:\;U:\;W:\;
