The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
- Microsoft Workgroup Connections, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Workgroup Connections workstation services may run either the basic or full
redirector.

Type the following to load basic workstation services (basic services are the
default):

  net start workstation

-or-

  net start basic

Type the following to load the full redirector services:

  net start full

You can change the default workstation service to full by adding the entry
AutoStart=Full in the [Network] section of the SYSTEM.INI file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The full redirector differs from the basic redirector in that it allows
named-pipe support and full LAN Manager API support.

The AutoStart= entry specifies which network terminate-and-stay- resident (TSR)
programs are loaded when the NET START command is issued with no arguments. By
default, this performs only a NETBIND to complete loading of protocols and
adapter drivers. If a later NET command requires loading of a redirector, the
full redirector is loaded by default.

If, however, you change the entry to AutoStart=Basic as the Workgroup Connections
installation program does, the NET START command placed in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
file starts the basic redirector. When the redirector loads, the NetBEUI TSR
also loads (if you don't already have a NetBIOS protocol present).

Other NET START options include:

  NET START [{POPUP | BASIC | FULL | WORKSTATION | NETBIND |
  NETBEUI}] [/LIST] [/YES]

  POPUP           Loads the pop-up interface into memory.
                  Use this option if the pop-up interface
                  is not automatically loaded each time you
                  start your computer.
  BASIC           Starts the basic redirector.
  FULL            Starts the full redirector.
  WORKSTATION     Starts the default redirector.
  NETBIND         Binds protocols and network card drivers.
  NETBEUI         Starts the NetBIOS interface.
  /LIST           Displays a list of the Workgroup Connection
                  components that have been started.
  /YES            Carries out the NET START command without
                  first prompting you to provide information or
                  confirm actions.

This entry takes a comma-separated list; for example

  AutoStart=NETBEUI,BASIC,POPUP

causes the indicated three services to start when NET START is issued from
AUTOEXEC.BAT.
