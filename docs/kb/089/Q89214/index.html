-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses how to enable the Microsoft Windows version 3.1 OLE drag
and drop functionality in version 1.0 of Freelance for Windows. Because version
1.0 of Freelance for Windows was developed before OLE technology, you must
manually edit the REG.DAT file to allow the application to support this
functionality in Windows 3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Windows 3.1, you can open or embed a document by dragging a file from a
directory in File Manager and placing the file on a minimized application, or by
dragging the file into the window of an active application. This process is
known as dragging and dropping.

For drag-and-drop functionality to work, the application being used in
conjunction with File Manager must directly support dynamic data exchange (DDE)
messaging.

For more information about drag-and-drop functionality, refer to pages 58-59 of
the "Microsoft Windows User's Guide."
