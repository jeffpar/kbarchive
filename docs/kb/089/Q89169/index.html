-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses three topics regarding running Sun's PC/NFS network with
Windows 3.0. PC/NFS is not a supported network.

- Version 3.5 Is Required.

- Printing on PC/NFS Network.

- Using File Manager on a PC/NFS Network.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Version 3.5 Is Required
-----------------------

You should use version 3.5 or later of the PC/NFS network when attempting to run
it with Windows 3.0.


Printing on PC/NFS Network
--------------------------

To print properly from the Sun PC/NFS Network when using Windows, do the
following:

1. Run the NSFCONF utility and modify the printers you intend to use inside
  Windows to:

  a. Print after five minutes.

  b. Print in RAW mode.

  Note: If you are going to print PostScript from inside Windows 3.0, the
  NSFCONF utility should be set to PostScript mode instead of to RAW mode to
  accept PostScript code.

2. Edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file and change the line

        prt *

  to:

       prt -t30 *

3. Instead of printing to an LPTx port, select the LPTx.OS2 port under Control
  Panel's Printers option.

For more information on printing, query on the following words in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  printing and unsupported and UNIX

Using File Manager on PC/NFS Network
------------------------------------

The error "System Error Network Error on Drive &lt;letter&gt;:", where
&lt;letter&gt; is the logical drive letter C to Z, may occur when opening
Windows 3.0 File Manager running in conjunction with a Sun PC-NFS network. The
following solution corrects this problem in most situations.

Solution
--------

Make sure that the network drives are mounted in logical order. For example, if
you have a local drive C, then start your network drive mountings with logical
drive D and continue from there alphabetically. In the CONFIG.SYS file, modify
the line

       DEVICE=PCNFS.SYS

as follows

       DEVICE=PCNFS.SYS /dn

where n is a number from 1 to 8, based on the number of drives you have
determined will be mounted. Do not include local hard drives in this number.
Because 8 is the maximum simultaneous drive mountings supported by Sun, this
number could be set to 8, and the amount of error messages received will be this
number minus the number of drives actually mounted.

The Sun products included here are manufactured by a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
performance or reliability.
