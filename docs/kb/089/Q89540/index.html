-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a critical error occurs on a system running Windows version 3.1, Windows
enters message mode and displays the blue full-screen window that reports that
an error has occurred. (This window is the window that appears when CTRL+ALT+DEL
is pressed.) When running Windows for Pen Computing version 1.0 or 1.0a, the
message window does not respond to keyboard input. The system appears to hang
for 15 seconds and then returns to Windows.

CAUSE
=====

Under Windows for Pen Computing, the pen driver installs a hook so that when the
blue message window is displayed, the pen driver gets control. This gives the
pen driver the ability to simulate a key stroke into the system thus preventing
machines that don't have a keyboard from hanging when the critical error message
window is displayed. Unfortunately, the pen driver's hook routine is intended
only for machines that do not have a keyboard attached. If a keyboard is
attached, all keystroke information is ignored for 15 seconds until the hook
routine simulates the pressing of the ENTER key. Thus, the system appears to
hang for 15 seconds.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is aware of this problem and is making every effort to inform the OEMs
that are currently providing pen drivers about the problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For a detailed description of the virtual pen driver and the Key_Hook_Proc, see
the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base titled "Understanding the Windows
Virtual Pen Driver." This article describes one possible workaround that an OEM
can use to work around this problem.
