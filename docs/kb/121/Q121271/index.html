SUMMARY
=======

When you are troubleshooting Novell NetWare issues, it is sometimes helpful to
eliminate the NetWare login script as a source of possible configuration
problems. This is consistent with the "clean boot" approach of eliminating as
many unknown factors as possible to isolate the cause of a specific problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Novell NetWare employs a system of login scripts. These scripts are similar to
batch files and are executed whenever a user logs on to a NetWare file server.
Listed below are some of the various login scripts.

System Login Script
-------------------

This script is processed first and applies to all users who log on to the file
server. It can be edited only by a NetWare Supervisor through the SYSCON
utility.

User Login Script
-----------------

This script is unique to each user and is processed after the System Login
script. It can usually be edited by the user through SYSCON.

Default Login Script
--------------------

This script is processed after the System Login script if there is no User Login
script for the user who is currently logging on. The Default Login script is
hard-coded into LOGIN.EXE and therefore cannot be edited.

There is a parameter on the LOGIN command that allows the user to specify a text
file to be used as an alternate login script, overriding all the standard login
scripts listed above. The command

        LOGIN /S C:\LOGIN.TXT

logs the user on to the currently attached file server and processes the file
C:\LOGIN.TXT as the login script, overriding all the standard NetWare login
scripts.

For a "clean logon" during troubleshooting, it is suggested that this login
script contain the following command line:

       MAP INSERT S16:=SYS:PUBLIC

This command assigns the drive letter Z: to the PUBLIC directory on the file
server (which contains the standard NetWare user utilities) and adds this drive
to the search path (MS-DOS PATH) so that the standard NetWare commands are
accessible to the user.

Novell NetWare is manufactured by Novell, Inc., a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
