-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a Windows NT 3.1 computer is sharing a printer that is redirected to a
Windows NT 3.5 computer, downlevel clients (like MS-DOS or Windows for
Workgroups) print jobs get stuck in the Windows NT 3.1 print queue.

CAUSE
=====

When a Windows NT 3.1 computer sends a downlevel print job, it sends the job as
a null session. Null sessions are those where the user credentials are blank
during the request to setup a session. Because the downlevel client may not have
an account or because of a conflicting account on the second print server,
downlevel jobs are sent as a null sessions. Security is up to the first computer
in this scenario.

Windows NT version 3.1 supports null sessions by default. However, Windows NT
version 3.5 does not provide this support unless specifically configured to do
so. This change was made in order to provide a higher default level of security.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem can be resolved by modifying the registry on the computer running
Windows NT 3.5 to allow null sessions to the print share.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor and locate the following Registry subkey in the
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree:

  \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Parameters

2. Select the NullSessionShares value.

3. From the Edit menu, select Multi String.

  NOTE: values will already exist and should not be replaced. If the values are
  accidentally deleted, just click Cancel and try again.

4. Select the first blank line after the values that currently exist. (The lines
  above should not be highlighted.) Add the name of the print share on Windows
  NT 3.5 you want to accept null sessions. This needs to be done for each share
  individually.

5. Click OK and exit Registry Editor.

6. Either shut down and restart Windows NT or from a command prompt type:" NET
  STOP SERVER" (without the quotation marks). Then type: "NET START SERVER"
  (without the quotation marks).


MORE INFORMATION
================

For a Windows NT LPD server to support print jobs that are redirected to a
second Windows NT shared print queue through a UNC name, NullSessionShares must
be used. The UNC name of the printer share must be added as a null share on the
second Windows NT print server. For example, if \\Server1 is the LPD server and
it's port is redirected to \\Server2\Printer, the UNC name \\SERVER2\Printer
must be added to NullSessionShares on \\Server2.

For additional information on using LPD, please see the following resource:

Windows NT Resource Kit 3.51 Volume 2, Networking Guide; Chapter 18,
"Internetwork Printing with TCP/IP," page 357.
