-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Golf for Windows, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you choose Rotate View (press F6) or Drop Ball (press F7) from the Action
menu in Golf while you view a recorded round of Golf, the computer may stop
responding (hang).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The options Aim Shot, Rotate View, and Drop Ball are not available from the
Action menu if a regular (that is, non-recorded) player is playing along with
the recorded player, or if Quick Start or New Game are chosen immediately after
starting Golf.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE
------------------

1. Start a new game.

2. In the Recorded Players section, select the Show Players box.

3. In the Players Available box, choose a recorded player's game (a small
  picture of a camera will precede the player's name to denote a recorded game)
  by selecting the player's name and clicking Add Player.

4. The recorded player's name will now appear in the Players Selected box.

5. Click Continue.

6. In the Game Settings box, click OK.

7. During the playback of the recorded game, a small Recorded Player dialog box
  will appear with the options of Pause or Continue. Click Pause (the Swing
  indicator will now appear as a large button with Continue on it).

  NOTE: Aim Shot, Rotate View, and Drop Ball are now unavailable (dimmed) in the
  Action menu.

8. From the File menu, choose Quick Start or New (F2). After choosing Quick
  Start or New, You receive the message: "There is a game in progress: Do you
  wish to exit?" Click Yes.

  Under Windows 95, the mouse pointer turns to an hour glass and the Golf
  program stops responding. To close the program, press CTRL-ALT-DEL. Choose
  Microsoft Golf from the list of programs and then click End Task. This
  returns you to the desktop and you may start Golf again.

9. Once the recorded player has restarted, click Pause in the Recorded Player
  dialog box.

  NOTE: The options for Aim Shot, Rotate View, and Drop Ball are now available
  from the Action menu.

10. Either rotate the view or drop the ball in a different position and click
  OK.

The computer stops responding.
