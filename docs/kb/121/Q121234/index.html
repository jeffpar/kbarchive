SYMPTOMS
========

If a Macintosh software package is created that contains the actual Installer in
a subfolder of the root of the original source package, and the package is then
distributed to a Macintosh client, the following message appears and Installer
cancels:

  The files needed for this installation could not be found on your server
  volume "SMS_SHR." Please contact your network administrator.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can be caused by a path name syntax error in the Command Line box
in the Command Line Properties dialog box of the Systems Management Server
Administrator program for the package.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure that if there is an executable file inside a subfolder of the package
root, that the path begins with a colon (:), followed by the folder names and
ending with the name of the executable file. If there are spaces in any of the
folder or file names, then the entire path needs to be surrounded by quotation
marks. For example, ":Master Set 1:Installer" for a package named "Mac Fonts,"
which includes folders Master Set 1, Master Set 2, and so on, and the Installer
application inside Master Set 1 is the executable file.

The path needs to begin with a colon because while MS-DOS, PC-DOS, and clone
operating systems use a backslash (\) to delimit paths, Apple Macintosh System
software uses a colon (:). Without the leading colon, the Macintosh System
software interprets any path as starting with a volume name.
