- Microsoft Creative Writer for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After logging in to Creative Writer, you may receive the following error message
from Spike:

  I can't read that. I can't look at "~Creative Writer Preferences" because I'm
  confused. Quit Creative Writer and restart your computer.

In addition, or alternatively, the font list under the Letterizer Tool may be
unreadable.

RESOLUTION
==========

Follow these steps to resolve the problem:

1. Exit Creative Writer.

2. Open the MSKids:Users folder.

3. Locate your user folder inside the Users folder, and open it.

4. Throw the ~Creative Writer Preferences file in the trash.

5. From the Special menu, choose Empty Trash.

6. Run Creative Writer and log in as yourself again.

After following these steps, you should be able to run Creative Writer and use
the Letterizer Tool successfully.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the font list is partially unreadable, it may be due to a problem with fonts
installed by other applications that have duplicate font IDs, or a corrupt font.
Do the following:

1. Run Creative Writer, and log in.

2. When you receive the error message, click Spike to continue.

3. Click the Letterizer Tool and make a note of the font that appears before the
  corrupt/unreadable font on the list.

4. Exit Creative Writer.

5. From the Apple Menu, choose Key Caps.

6. From the Key Caps menu, find the font that follows the font that you made a
  note of in step 3.

7. Remove that font from the System Folder:Fonts folder.

8. Open the MSKids:Users folder.

9. Locate your user folder inside the Users folder and open it.

10. Throw the ~Creative Writer Preferences file in the trash.

11. From the Special menu, choose Empty Trash.

12. Run Creative Writer and log in as yourself again.
