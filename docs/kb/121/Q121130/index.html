- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The MMFCLEAN utility may cause a general protection fault (GP fault) in the
Microsoft Windows operating system when you access a postoffice, if a large
number of gateway addresses have been added to the postoffice address list.

CAUSE
=====

Postoffice address lists that include a large number of gateway addresses may
create a problem for MMFCLEAN during the initialization process.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, perform the following steps:

1. Create two subdirectories, GLB and NME, on a local hard disk drive.

2. Place the three access files (ACCESS.GLB, ACCESS2.GLB, and ACCESS3.GLB) from
  the postoffice into the local GLB subdirectory, and place a zero- byte
  ADMIN.NME file in the local NME subdirectory.

3. Run ACCTONME.EXE from the root of the local hard disk drive. A new ADMIN.NME
  file will be created.

4. Ensure that no one is accessing the postoffice with the Mail Administrator,
  Import, or Moveuser program.

5. Make a backup copy of the ADMINSHD.NME file.

6. Copy the newly created ADMIN.NME file to the ADMINSHD.NME file located on the
  active postoffice.

7. Run MMFCLEAN and then restore the ADMINSHD.NME file from backup.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of MMFCLEAN. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
