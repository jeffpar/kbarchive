-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to run the Windows 95 ScanDisk Disk Checking and Repair Tool
(SCANDSKW.EXE) from an MS-DOS command prompt with the current drive locked, you
receive the following error message:

  This program requires Microsoft Windows.


CAUSE
=====

ScanDisk cannot run on a drive that has been locked in an MS-DOS window.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you unlock the drive, you can run ScanDisk. To do this:

1. Use the COMMAND.COM Unlock switch as follows:

  UNLOCK &lt;drive&gt;:

2. Run SCANDSKW again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

ScanDisk for Windows 95 does not run on locked drives. This behavior is by
design. You must unlock the drive before ScanDisk can be used.

If you try to run SCANDSKW from an MS-DOS command prompt on a locked drive, but
the current drive is not locked, you receive the following error message:

  The ScanDisk operation cannot be performed now. It may work at a later time
  or if you shut down applications that are accessing the drive.

For example, if drive C is the current drive and drive D is locked, you receive
the above error when you run SCANDSKW D: from the C: drive.

If you start the ScanDisk graphical user interface first and then select a drive
that has been locked, you also receive the above error message. If you choose OK
and then choose to start the ScanDisk operation anyway, you receive the
following error message:

  The ScanDisk operation failed to complete because the ScanDisk operation is
  not supported on this drive. Note that this may be caused by the drive being
  locked by another application or the system.
