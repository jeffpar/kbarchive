SYMPTOMS
========

You create a .CAL file that includes a space in the filename (for example, JOHN
DOE.CAL), and later Schedule+ does not allow access to this file. The following
error message is displayed

  &lt;JOHN DOE.CAL&gt;
  This filename is invalid.

where &lt;JOHN DOE.CAL&gt; is the filename containing a space.

CAUSE
=====

Schedule+ allows the creation of a .CAL file with a space in the filename if you
are working offline and if you have not yet set up Mail. (Mail does not allow a
Mailbox entry that includes a space to be established.) When you start Schedule+
for the first time, it prompts you for a Mailbox entry. It is possible to
include a space in this entry. Schedule+ continues to work; however, if Mail is
later installed, Schedule+ cannot access the .CAL file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

- Rename the file at the MS-DOS command prompt. For example:

  REN JOHN?DOE.CAL JOHNDOE.CAL

  -or-

- If the .CAL file contains no data, delete the file. For example:

  DEL JOHN?DOE.CAL

If information is needed from this file, export the file and re-import the file
under the new mailbox name, which does not contain a space.

If Mail has been started and Schedule+ no longer allows access to the .CAL file,
you must rename the MSMAIL.INI and MSMAIL.MMF files, restart Schedule+, and
export the .CAL file.
