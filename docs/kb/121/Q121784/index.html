SUMMARY
=======

To make management of log files easier on heavily-used FTP servers, additional
FTP server logging options were added to Windows NT version 3.5 after the
manuals and Help were finalized.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To make changes to the FTP Server service configuration using Registry Editor:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

  \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\ftpsvc\Parameters

  The parameters described below are located under this Registry subkey.

  The following describes the value entries for FTP Server service parameters
  that can only be set by adding an entry in Registry Editor. These value
  entries do not appear by default in the Registry, so you must add an entry if
  you want to change its default value. The FTP Server service must be
  restarted for changes to take effect.

  LogFileDirectory
  Data Type = REG_SZ
  Specifies the target directory for the log files. It will default to
  %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32 (compatible with current behavior).

  NOTE: When you set LogFileDirectory, make sure you create the corresponding
  directory. If you do not, the directory is not created automatically and
  errors occur.

  LogFileAccess
  Data Type = REG_DWORD
  Previously, 0 meant don't log, and 1 meant log. This has been changed to:

  0 - Don't log anything.
  1 - Log everything to FTPSVC.LOG (compatible with current behavior).
  2 - Create daily logs.

  If daily logs are enabled, then entries are written to a file of the form
  FTYYMMDD.LOG, where YY is the current year, MM is the current month, and DD
  is the current day. A log file generated on October 31, 1994 would be named
  FT941031.LOG. "Today's" log file will be held open (just as FTPSVC.LOG is).
  Whenever an entry is to be written to the log, if the day has changed from
  the previous entry, then the previous log is closed, a new log filename is
  generated, and the new log is opened.

Note that LogFileDirectory is independent of the LogFileAccess mode. It is
reasonable to specify that the "old-style" FTPSVC.LOG be written to a directory
other than %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32. Likewise, a "new-style" FTYYMMDD.LOG file will
default to %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32 if no LogFileDirectory value is present in the
Registry.
