SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message with attachments over a Wang X.400 Connector,
attachments are lost. You can open the mail message using any client, but no
attachments are present. Wang sends a Winmail.dat file with the attachment. The
Winmail.dat file and attachments are seen as bilaterally- defined attributes in
the P2 portion of an ASN.1 parsed message. An example is shown below:

  P2_Bilat_defined_prim [...attachment data here...]
  P2_Bilat_defined_prim [...IPM.Microsoft Mail.Note....]

The first line includes the attachment information and the second line contains
the Winmail.dat attachment. The Winmail.dat attachment holds properties of the
attachment such as file name and it's exact position in the message. These
properties are described using Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format, or TNEF.

CAUSE
=====

The incoming Winmail.dat file from Wang does not include a display name
property, PR_DISPLAY_NAME, as part of the description for the attachment.
