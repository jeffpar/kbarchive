  Option                             Option Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Combine table borders              If a table contains two contiguous
  like Word 5.x for                  cells whose border is formatted
  the Macintosh                      differently, the left-most cell is
                                     displayed with the border width of
                                     the right-most cell.

  Do full justification              To achieve full justification,
  like WordPerfect 6.x               WordPerfect compresses the spaces
  for Windows                        between words while Word expands
                                     them. This often results in different
                                     line breaks and leads to different
                                     page breaks. To implement the
                                     WordPerfect justification method,
                                     select "Do full justification like
                                     WordPerfect 6.x for Windows" in the
                                     Options list.

  Don't add automatic tab            Ignores the automatic tab stop that
  stop for hanging indent            Word 6.0 uses when creating a hanging
                                     indent.

  Don't add extra space              Prevents Word from inserting
  for raised/lowered                 additional space between lines to
  characters                         accommodate raised or lowered
                                     characters.

  Don't add leading                  Displays text without leading between
  (extra space) between              the lines. This is the same
  rows of text                       functionality that exists in Word
                                     versions 5.x for the Macintosh.

  Don't add space for                Word doesn't add extra space for
  underlines                         underlines.

  Don't balance columns              Prevents Word from balancing
  for continuous section             columns at the end of a section or
  starts                             document.

  Don't balance SBCS                 Not used in U.S. English Word.
  characters and DBCS
  characters

  Don't blank the area               Prevents Word from obscuring any text
  behind metafile                    or graphics surrounding an inserted
  pictures                           metafile. Selecting this option
                                     decreases editing speed.

  Don't center "exact                Changes the vertical position of text
  line height" lines                 between the top of the line space and
                                     the bottom of the line space.
                                     With the option off, any extra space
                                     is split between the ascender and
                                     descender. With the option on, all
                                     the extra space goes to the
                                     descender.

  Don't convert                      Not used in U.S. English Word.
  backslash characters
  into yen signs

  Don't draw underline               Not used in U.S. English Word.
  on trailing spaces

  Expand character                   Justifies the line ending with
  spaces on the line                 SHIFT+ENTER when the paragraph
  ending SHIFT+RETURN                is formatted as justified.

  Expand/condense by                 Rounds the measurement of the
  whole number of points             spacing for characters with
                                     condensed or expanded spacing to
                                     the nearest whole number.

  Lines wrap like                    Not used in U.S. English Word.
  Word 6.0

  Print body text before             Prints the main text layer before the
  header/footer                      Header/Footer layer, which allows for
                                     the process of PostScript codes in
                                     the text layer the same way Word 5.x
                                     for the Macintosh does. (This
                                     functionality is the reverse of the
                                     default order.)

  Print colors as black              Prints all colors as black, instead
  on noncolor printers               of using grayscale (different shades
                                     of gray) when you use a printer that
                                     does not print color.

  Set the width of a                 WordPerfect calculates the width of a
  space like WordPerfect 5.x         space in a proportional font
                                     differently than Word does. In the
                                     WordPerfect interface, this default
                                     word spacing is named WordPerfect
                                     Optimal. The Word 97 text converters
                                     can use the WordPerfect formula for
                                     spacing.

  Show hard page or                  If a frame contains a manual, or hard
  column breaks in frames            page break or column break, Word
                                     displays it.

  Substitute fonts based             Option used by the WordPerfect 6.x
  on font size                       converter to make a font request
                                     based on font size first, and if a
                                     match is not found, to actually map
                                     the font.

  Suppress extra line                WordPerfect suppresses any extra line
  spacing at bottom                  spacing from the last line on a page.
  of page                            For example, if line spacing is set
                                     to double, the final line on the page
                                     does not show White space below it.
                                     To implement the line-spacing
                                     feature, select "Suppress extra line
                                     spacing at bottom of page" in the
                                     Options list.

  Suppress extra line                Prevents Word from adding extra line
  spacing at top of page             spacing at the top of a page. If the
                                     line spacing for the line at the top
                                     of a page is set for more than single
                                     spacing, Word ignores the extra
                                     spacing so that the top margin will
                                     not increase.

  Suppress extra line                Prevents Word from adding extra line
  spacing at the top of              spacing at the top of a page. If the
  page like Word 5.x                 line spacing for the line at the top
  for the Macintosh                  of a page is set for more than single
                                     line spacing, Word ignores the extra
                                     spacing so that the top margin will
                                     not increase.

  Suppress extra line                This ensures that the layout of
  spacing like WordPerfect 5.x       converted WordPerfect documents
                                     formatted with Automatic line height
                                     closely matches that of the original
                                     document.

  Suppress space before              Word suppresses the space in a
  after a hard page or               paragraph formatted with the Space
  column break                       Before option that follows a hard
                                     page break or column break.

  Swap left and right                If a paragraph has a left border
  borders on odd facing              (not a box) and the "Different
  pages                              Odd/Even Headers" or "Mirror Margins"
                                     check box is selected, Word prints
                                     the border on the right on odd
                                     numbered pages.

  Treat \" as " " in                 In a data source, converts a
  mail merge data sources            delimiter composed of a backslash and
                                     quotation mark (\") to two quotation
                                     marks (" "), so that Word can
                                     recognize quotation marks.

  Truncate font height               Word rounds the font size up or down
                                     as in WordPerfect 6.x for Windows.

  Use larger small caps              Applies small caps formatting in Word
  like Word 5.x for the              version 6.0 for the Macintosh the
  Macintosh                          same way as Word version 5.x for the
                                     Macintosh, which produces slightly
                                     larger smaller capital letters.

  Use printer metrics                If this option is enabled, Word will
  to lay out document                use the information from the printer
                                     driver that is installed as in some
                                     earlier versions of Word.

                                     If this option is disabled (default),
                                     Word will use build-in metrics to lay
                                     out the document. This means your
                                     document will look the same no matter
                                     what printer driver is installed.

  Use Word 6.x/95 Border             Word suppresses paragraph borders
  Rules                              when paragraph is intersected by
                                     frames or wrapped drawing objects.

  Wrap Trailing Spaces               Automatically moves any spaces that
  To Next Line                       trail into the margin after a word at
                                     the end of a line to the beginning of
                                     the next line.
