-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

Problems can occur if some devices are disabled through the H/W Profile option
in the Devices tool in Control Panel. These problems may include boot failures
or system initialization errors.

If you start the Devices tool in Control Panel, the device may show that it is
set to start at Boot or System (or some system devices are set by default to
disabled), but the device never starts.

CAUSE
=====

This problem could be caused because the device has been disabled in its
hardware profile.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some specific scenarios follow:

- Disabling the H/W Profile for FASTFAT will result in no longer being able to
  access FAT partitions or the floppy disk drives and causes the following
  error message to occur:

  The volume does not contain a recognizable file system.

  Also, if Windows NT has to start from a drive that is FAT and this driver has
  been disabled, it could cause a STOP:0X0000006B
  Process1_initialization_failed error message.

- Disabling the H/W Profile for the video driver for the specific video adapter
  can cause a scenario where you go in and try to load a different driver and
  it seems to make the change, but when the computer is restarted, the VGA
  driver is the one that loads.

- Disabling the H/W Profile for ATDISK will result in no access to IDE devices,
  except for IDE devices that use ATAPI. If the operating system starts from
  the IDE device, it could cause a STOP:0X0000007B error message.

- Disabling the H/W Profile for DISK will result in no access to SCSI devices
  or ATAPI IDE devices and, if the operating system starts from a SCSI device,
  it could cause a STOP:0X0000007B error message.

- Disabling the H/W Profile for the CD-ROM drive can cause a scenario where you
  cannot access the CD-ROM drive and, if you try to start the driver manually,
  it reports that it has been disabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

After investigating normal causes for device drivers failing to start, check the
hardware profile setting as follows:

1. In the Devices tool in Control Panel, select the device in question.

2. Click H/W Profiles.

3. Make sure the status is not disabled. If it is disabled, click Enable.

4. Restart the computer.

If this procedure also fails, install a parallel copy of Windows NT and edit the
registry of the original installation. For more information on how to edit the
registry of an installation on the same computer, refer to the following
Knowledge Base article:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q165748
  TITLE : How to Disable a Service or Device that Prevents NT from Booting

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Run Regedt32 and select HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.

2. From the Registry tab, select Load Hive.

3. Use the Look In drop-down list box to locate the failed installation. Locate
  the %SystemRoot% of the broken installation and follow the path to the
  "system." file (BrokenInstall\System32\Config\System.).

  NOTE: There is no extension, just a period (.) in the file name.

4. Click Open, and then type Fix as the Key Name. You will be returned to
  Regedt32 with the new hive named Fix as the first entry under
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.

5. Double-click Fix under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE and follow the tree to:

  \ControlSetXXX\Hardware Profiles\Current\System\CurrentControlSet
  \Enum\Root\Legacy_(devicename)\0000

  NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

6. Set the following values for this key:

  CSConfigFlags:REG_DWORD: 0 or 1
                           0 for ENABLED
                           1 for DISABLED
