SYMPTOMS
========

File Transfer Protocol (FTP) clients are allowed to view files and directories
on an NTFS partition, although they have not been given this right through the
file and directory permissions. However, if these clients try to view the files
through a Microsoft network connection, they will receive the error:

  You do not have permission to access this directory.

CAUSE
=====

As long as a user has EXECUTE (X) permission on a directory and is a member of a
group that has execute permission, or as long as that user has explicitly been
given the user right to Back up files and directories, the user will be able to
list the files and subdirectories in that directory. This will occur even if the
user has been granted No Access to files in that directory.

For example:

If the user has been given as little access as: Special Access (X)(None), that
user will be able to list the files and subdirectories in that directory. That
user will still, however, get an "access is denied" error when trying to
manipulate the files and subdirectories.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not give FTP users the BACK UP FILES AND DIRECTORIES user right, if it is
important that files and subdirectories be hidden through permissions.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
