- Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While using the SQL Debugger to debug a Trigger, the debugger doesn't break on
each breakpoint that you have set.

CAUSE
=====

The SQL Debugger allows you to set breakpoints on any line of code inside a
Trigger regardless of whether it is a valid line of code.

RESOLUTION
==========

The breakpoints that the debugger skips are placed on invalid lines of code.

To avoid this issue, place breakpoints on valid debuggable lines of SQL code
only.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual C++ version 6.0
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This bug only pertains to Triggers. While debugging a Stored Procedure, the
debugger only allows you to set breakpoints on valid lines of code. If you try
to set a breakpoint on an invalid line of code while debugging a stored
procedure, the breakpoint is moved to the next valid debuggable line of SQL
code.

When you are using a stored procedure and setting breakpoints before you start
debugging, you can set breakpoints anywhere in the code including non-debuggable
statements. However, as soon as you start debugging, you receive the following
warning and breakpoints are moved:

  One or more breakpoints are not positioned on valid lines.
  These breakpoints have been moved to the next valid lines.

When you are using a trigger and setting breakpoints before you start debugging,
you can set breakpoints anywhere in the code including non- debuggable
statements. The warning listed above is not shown and invalid breakpoints are
not removed during debugging.

Sample Code
-----------

     CREATE TRIGGER MyTrigger
     ON authors
     FOR DELETE
     AS

     /* Can set a breakpoint on the DECLARE line however since this isn't a
     valid debuggable line the debugger will skip over it and stop on the
     SELECT line */ 

        DECLARE  @charVar CHAR

        SELECT * FROM Authors
