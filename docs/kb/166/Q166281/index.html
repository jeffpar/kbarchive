- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The UserConnection Designer is one of the new ActiveX Designers included with
Visual Basic 5.0 and higher. It allows you to wrap SQL or a Stored Procedure
with code at design time so you can call it as a method at run time. This way,
Visual Basic will list the parameters of your stored procedure in the object
browser just as it does with any other VBA method. This new functionality can
replace the rdoPreparedStatement and rdoQuery objects, although these are still
available.

The following is an excerpt on the UserConnection from Books Online:

  The UserConnection designer uses Visual Basic's ActiveX designer architecture
  to provide design-time support for programmatic data access. It allows you to
  create connection and query objects at design time. These connections and
  queries are persisted as project-level objects. You can pre-set properties,
  define new properties and methods, and write code behind the objects to catch
  events.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This sample uses SQL Server and the Pubs database, but you can change the DSN,
UID, PWD, and SQL to match any ODBC database you may be using.

Task One: Create the Example Stored Procedure
---------------------------------------------

1. This sample SQL Server stored procedure accepts an input parameter of au_id
  and returns a resultset and a test output variable. The test output variable
  is hard-coded and has no meaning except to demonstrate how to return an
  output using a UserConnection. If you are not using SQL Server, you might
  have to modify the SQL into an acceptable format for your database server.

2. To create this stored procedure you will need a tool that allows you to
  execute SQL such as ISQL/W or MSQuery included with SQL Server. Select the
  Pubs database, then place the following Create Procedure T-SQL in the SQL
  window of your selected tool and execute it:

        Create procedure GetAuthorInfo
          @au_id Varchar(11), @testOut Varchar(10) OUTPUT As
          Select * from authors Where au_id = @au_id
          Select @testOut = 'Hello'

Task Two: Create the Userconnection
-----------------------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic and choose "Standard EXE." Form1 is
  created by default.

2. From the Project menu, select Components, select the Designer tab, and then
  place a check next to Microsoft UserConnection.

3. From the Project menu, select Add ActiveX Designer, then select Microsoft
  UserConnection. This will bring up a dialog titled UserConnection1
  Properties.

4. On the Connection tab, select either a DSN or a DSN-Less connection and fill
  in the appropriate information. If you select DSN-less, make sure you specify
  a database in the Other ODBC Attributes area with database=pubs. On the
  Authentication tab, fill in your username and password, and place a check
  next to Save Connection Information for Design time. On the Miscellaneous tab
  in the Other section, choose Use ODBC Cursor Library because you have more
  than one Select statement in your stored procedure.

5. Click OK to save this information, and return to the Designer window. Press
  the F4 key to display the Properties window and change the Name property from
  UserConnection1 to StoredProcs.

6. Insert a new Query by right-clicking on StoredProcs and choosing Insert Query
  or by clicking on the Insert Query toolbar icon. Change the name of the Query
  from Query1 to GetAuthorInfo. From the Source of Query, choose Based on
  Stored Procedure, then select the stored procedure you created earlier,
  GetAuthorInfo.

7. If you select the Parameters tab, you can review the input and output
  parameters. Your GetAuthorInfo Query setup is now finished. Click OK to close
  the Dialog.

8. To place code in the connection event of your UserConnection, select View
  Code from the UserConnection toolbar. Choose UserConnection in from the
  upper-left combo box, then choose the Connect Event from the upper-right
  combo box. Place the following code in the UserConnection Connect event:

        Debug.Print "Connect"

Task Three: The Userconnection Code
-----------------------------------

1. Add a CommandButton, Command1, to Form1 of Project1.

2. Paste the following code in the General Declarations section of Form1:

        Private Sub Command1_Click()
          Dim objSP As New StoredProcs             'creatable UC object
          Dim objRs As rdoResultset                'pointer to rdoResultset
          Dim lngRet As Long, strOut As String     'vars to hold output

          objSP.EstablishConnection rdDriverNoPrompt  'establish connection
          lngRet = objSP.GetAuthorInfo("648-92-1872", strOut) 'SP method
          Set objRs = objSP.LastQueryResults          'get results off objRs
          Debug.Print lngRet, strOut, objRs(0)        'output example results
        End Sub

3. Start the program or press the F5 key.

4. Click the Command1 button to execute the UserConnection code. The Stored
  Procedure return value, output value, and the first column of the returned
  resultset will print in the Debug window.
