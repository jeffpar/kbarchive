SUMMARY
=======

This article contains a sample Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications macro
(Sub procedure) that prints the current slide in a running slide show.

When running a slide show, it may be desirable, especially if in kiosk mode, to
be able to print the current slide in a running slideshow out to a printer. The
following code allows you to do just that.

This macro code would be used with an action button, placed on the master slide,
and attached to the action button via its action settings. Once on the master,
it would be available for all slides, and it will print whichever slide is
currently on display in the slideshow.

Sample Visual Basic Procedure
-----------------------------

    ' This code determines what slide is currently visible in the
     ' slide show and then it clears the print range and prints out the
     ' current slide.
     Sub PrintCurrentSlide()

     ' Declare lSldNum as a long integer.
     Dim lSldNum As Long

     ' Assign lSldNum to the current slide number.
     lSldNum = SlideShowWindows(1).View.Slide.SlideNumber

     ' Set the print options for the active presentation.
     With ActivePresentation.PrintOptions

        ' Set RangeType to print a slide range.
        .RangeType = ppPrintSlideRange

        ' Delete old print range settings.
        .Ranges.ClearAll

        ' Set Ranges to the new range for the current slide.
        .Ranges.Add lSldNum, lSldNum
     End With

     ' Using the current print settings print the slide to the default
     ' printer.
     ActivePresentation.PrintOut
     End Sub
