SYMPTOMS
========

Although there is a path to deliver a message between two Microsoft Mail
postoffices by using two Microsoft Mail Connectors, you may not be able to send
a message with attachments. This problem only occurs on versions of Microsoft
Exchange Server which are enabled for double-byte character set (DBCS), such as
Japanese.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the following environment, User-A can send a message to User-B. However, when
User-A sends a message with attachments to User-B, User-A will occasionally
receive a non-delivery report (NDR) from the postmaster of SRV- B's Microsoft
Mail Connector interchange (MSMI).

         (User-A)                              (User-B)

When you set Diagnostics Logging to Maximum for the MSExchangeMSMI on the
Microsoft Mail Connector's property page using the Microsoft Exchange
Administrator program, the following event will appear in the receiving
Microsoft Exchange Server's (SRV-B) Windows NT Event Viewer Application log:

   Event ID : 10000
   Source: MSExchangeMSMI
   Type:Information
   MDBEF parsing failed in Rich text information

User-A will receive an NDR from the postmaster. This NDR only includes the title
of the original message and the reason of NDR:

  Microsoft Mail Connector fails in analysis the contents.

This occurs when the message created in a DBCS language is passed between two
Microsoft Mail postoffices using two MSMIs.

This may occur when all of the following conditions are true:

- The message is sent through two MSMIs which are DBCS enabled.

  -and-

- The client application is also DBCS enabled.

  -and-

- The message includes attachments.
