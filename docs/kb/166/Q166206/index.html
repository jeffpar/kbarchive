SYMPTOMS
========

When you update a text form field that contains a date, the month and day will
be transposed. For example, if the text form field is specified as date, and the
date format is M/d/yyyy, and you type 1/8 for January 8, the field result is 8/1
when the field is updated.

This problem occurs when all of the following are true:

- The text form field type is set for Date.

  -and-

- The text form field date format begins with a month, such as M/d/yyyy.

  -and-

- You type the date without including the year. For example, you type 1/8.

demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug procedures. Microsoft
support professionals can help explain the functionality of a particular
procedure, but they will not modify these examples to provide added
functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific needs. If you have
limited programming experience, you may want to contact a Microsoft Certified
Partner or the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more

To work around this problem, use the following macro that formats the text you
type into a form field in a specified date format:

     Sub FormatDate_OnExit()
        Dim fField As FormField
        Dim dDateFormat As String
        ' Specify the date format.
        sDateFormat = "M/d/yyyy"
        ' In the following command, change "Text1"
        ' to match your formfield bookmark name.
        Set fField = ActiveDocument.FormFields("Text1")
        If IsDate(fField.Result) Then
           fField.Result = Format$(CDate(fField.Result), sDateFormat)
        End If
     End Sub

After you create the macro, set up the form using the following steps:

1. On the Tools menu, click Unprotect Document.

2. Double-click the form field.

3. In the Type box, click Regular Text.

4. In the On Exit box, click the macro you created.

5. Click OK.

When the form field is updated, the date is displayed in the format you specified
in the macro.
