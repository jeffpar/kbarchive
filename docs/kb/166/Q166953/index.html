-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
- the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to open a document that was created in non-Word format, you may
receive one of the following error messages:

  Cannot locate Msconv97.dll.

  -or-

  Cannot locate conversions library.

CAUSE
-----

There are two possible causes:

- The Msconv97.dll file is in the wrong location. You will receive the error
  message if the Msconv97.dll file is in a different location from the text
  converters.

- The Wpft632.cnv file was incorrectly installed. If Office 95 is installed on
  your computer and if you install any 97-series Microsoft program, Wpft632.cnv
  is re-installed and registered. Some programs, such as Microsoft Publisher
  97, install or update the Wpft632.cnv file and register it. When the 97
  programs are subsequently uninstalled, some of those components or registry
  entries may not be removed.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the Files Are in the Wrong Location
--------------------------------------


Use one of the following methods to correct the problem:

Method 1:

Remove the text converters that are not in the \Microsoft Shared\Textconv
directory and run Microsoft Office Setup to install them to the correct
directory.

Method 2:

Copy the Msconv97.dll file to the directory that contains the text converters.
The most likely directory is \Msapps\Textconv.

If You Suspect That Msconv97.dll or Wpft632.cnv Was Installed Incorrectly
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Search the hard disk drive for any occurrences of Msconv97.dll and
  Wpft632.cnv and rename those files.

2. Remove the following registry entries:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Shared Tools\CNVCORE

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion
        \SharedDLLs

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Shared Tools
        \Text Converters\Import\WordPerfect6x

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Shared Tools
        \Text Converters\Import\WrdPrfctDOS

  WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
  require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
  resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
  Registry Editor at your own risk.

  For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
  Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you
  should make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat)
  before you edit the registry.

3. Run Office 95 Setup and remove all of the text converters. Choose Yes to
  remove shared components. If you are correcting an Office 97 installation,
  perform a Remove All of Office 95.

4. If you are restoring an Office 95 installation, run Office 95 Setup and
  reinstall the text converters you want to use. If you are correcting an
  Office 97 installation, reinstall the Office 97 text converters you want to
  use.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.


MORE INFORMATION
================

text converters of the remaining applications may not work as expected. For more
