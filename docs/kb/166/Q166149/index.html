-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Windows NT systems send out requests to DHCP to reserve addresses for
RAS, but the systems that are sending the requests are setup for Dial-out only.

In some cases, this is noticed by DHCP servers running out of leases completely.
To prevent the unattended setup computers from experiencing the problem of
grabbing DHCP addresses, add the following to your unattended setup file:

  [RemoteAccess]
  PortSections=RASDialOut
  DialoutProtocols=ALL
  ;  Prevent the server componant from requesting an IP address.
  UseDHCP=No
  StaticAddressBegin=1.1.1.1
  StaticAddressEnd=1.1.1.1
  ClientCanRequestIPAddress=No

Currently, the only solution for computers already affected by this problem is to
manually run through the configuration options for Remote Access via Control
Panel and enable the system to update.

NOTE: The Dial-out options should be configured as expected based on the
unattended answer file, so there is no need to change any of the parameters.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT unattended setup provides the ability to install and configure Remote
Access for Dial-in, Dial-out, or Dial in and out.

If the unattend answer file is configured to install Remote Access as a Dial-out
client only, server components and registry values are installed that should not
be.

Properties of the Remote Access Service are checked in the Control Panel Network
Services tab. All options are displayed as configured correctly for Dial-out
Only. Upon exiting the configuration menu for Remote Access, the system can
reset the bindings and update the registry. Once the updates are complete, a
prompt is displayed, asking that the system be restarted. After the restart,
everything is installed correctly and the server side of Remote Access has been
removed.

NOTE: The affected computers cannot act as RAS servers. They can only grab DHCP
addresses.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server and
Workstation version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is an example of the Modem and Network sections of an Unattend.txt
file that installs the extra components of RAS as described in the Cause
section:

     [Modem]
     InstallModem = ModemParameters

     [ModemParameters]
     COM2 = "Hayes V-Series Ultra Smartmodem 9600"

     [Network]
     DetectAdapters = ""
     InstallProtocols = ProtocolsSection
     InstallServices = ServicesSection
     JoinDomain = BOBSDOMAIN
     CreateComputerAccount = ADMINISTRATOR

     [ProtocolsSection]
     NBF = NBFParamSection
     NWLNKIPX = NWLNKIPXParamSection
     TC = TCParamSection

     [NBFParamSection]

     [NWLNKIPXParamSection]

     [TCParamSection]
     DHCP = yes

     [ServicesSection]
     RAS = RASParamSection

     [RASParamSection]
     PortSections = PortSection1
     DialoutProtocols = ALL

     [PortSection1]
     PortName = COM2
     DeviceType = Modem
     PortUsage = DialOut
