-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the steps involved for successfully upgrading a computer
running Windows NT Workstation 3.51 to version 4.0 using both Systems Management
Server versions 1.1 and 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Step 1: Preparing the Required Files
------------------------------------

Sending Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 unattended upgrade jobs using Systems
Management Server requires the following:

1. A Windows NT Workstation package definition file (PDF), available at:

   - On the Windows NT Workstation 4.0 compact disc in the platform directory
     of your choice

   - http://www.microsoft.com/SMSMGMT/pdfs.htm.

2. An unattended setup script.

   - Ntupgrad.scr is supplied in the Sms\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\mstest directory
     of a Systems Management Server 1.2 installation. You must rename this file
     to Ntupgrad.400.

3. The Windows NT Workstation setup wrapper files.

  For Systems Management Server 1.2, this is not a concern. Systems Management
  Server 1.1 requires the updated Systems Management Server 1.2 wrapper file.
  The wrapper files are operating system and platform specific, and are located
  in the Sms\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\mstest directory. If you do not have access
  to a Systems Management Server 1.2 compact disc, contact Microsoft Technical
  Support.

  Wrapper file names, operating systems, and hardware platforms are:

   - Ntencap.exe: Windows NT Workstation on x86-compatible computers

   - Ntencapa.exe: Windows NT Workstation on Digital Alpha computers

   - Ntencapm.exe: Windows NT Workstation on MIPS computers

4. The retail version of Windows NT Workstation 4.0.

  You must use a fully licensed retail version of Windows NT Workstation 4.0. A
  limited license, developer edition, or OEM version of Windows NT Workstation
  will not work.

Step 2: Preparing the Source Directory
--------------------------------------

It is possible to use the entire Windows NT Workstation compact disc as the
source for the package, but it is not recommended. The compact disc contains all
platform versions of Windows NT Workstation, as well as the debug symbols for
each platform. Keep in mind that to distribute the package, Systems Management
Server requires at least four times the amount of disk space as the source
requires.

1. Create a directory on the site server or any other computer running Windows
  NT Workstation or Server on the network. Give the directory a name like
  Ntw4.src.

2. Share the directory.

3. Copy and rename the Ntupgrad.scr file to Ntupgrd.400 to the newly created
  directory (in this case, the Ntw4.src directory).

4. Copy the appropriate version of NTENCAP to the Ntw4.src directory.

5. Copy the Nt40.pdf file to the Sms\Primesite.srv\Import.src\Enu directory on
  the site server.

6. Insert the Windows NT Workstation 4.0 compact disc in an assessable CD-ROM
  drive.

7. From the root of the Windows NT Workstation 4.0 compact disc, copy the
  Autorun.inf and Cdrom_w.40 files to the Ntw4.src directory.

8. Copy the entire platform directory of your chose to the Ntw4.src directory
  (for example, Ntw4.src\I386).

Step 3: Create the Package
--------------------------

1. Start the Systems Management Server Administrator program.

2. open the Packages window.

3. On the File menu, click New.

4. Click Import.

5. Drill down to the site server's Primsite.srv\Import.src\Enu directory.

6. Select the Windows NT Workstation 4.0 PDF.

7. Click the Workstations button.

8. Type in the UNC share name of the source file (for example,
  \\Mango\Ntw4.src).

9. Click Close and update the package at all sites.

Step 4: Distribute the Package
------------------------------

1. Make sure that you have at least four times the size of the source directory
  of available free space on the Systems Management Server installation drive
  on the site server.

2. Arrange the windows in the Systems Management Server Administrator program so
  that you can see both the Packages window and the Sites window.

3. In the Sites window, drill down to the domain that your target computer
  belongs to.

4. Drag the package from the package window and drop it on the target computer.
  Doing this will bring up a Job Details dialog box.

5. In the Job Details dialog box, make sure the package and job targets are
  correct. Under the Run Phase, select "Automated Upgrade on &lt;platform&gt;"
  (for example, "Automated Upgrade on x86" for a computer with an Intel
  processor.)

6. Set the Offer After, Mandatory, and Expires After dates.

7. Click OK.

8. Click OK in the Job Properties dialog box.

Step 5: Run the Package
-----------------------

When the package appears in the workstation's Package Command Manager (PCM),
click the Execute button.

Troubleshooting
---------------

1. If the package fails to run correctly, check the Pcmwin32.log file and the
  Ntencap.log file in the client's Ms\Sms\Logs directory.

2. Try to manually connect to the SMS_PKG package source on the distribution
  server, change to the appropriate package ID directory, and try to run the
  command line from there.

NOTE: There are several known issues with performing a Windows NT Server upgrade
using the PCM service. These issues have been addressed in the PCM service
update and is included in Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 2. You can
find information and updates for the PCM service at

  http://microsoft.com/smsmgmt,

and in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.
