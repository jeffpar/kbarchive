SUMMARY
=======

This article tells you how to change a user's target address or to view the
user's current target address or e-mail proxies.

Each user in the address book is either treated as a Local (mailbox) user or a
Custom Recipient located at another mail system. All users have e- mail proxies
for all the other connected systems.

When a user is defined as a Custom Recipient, the user's primary e-mail address
or Target Address determines the routing path and on which system the user is
located. There are also e-mail proxies of all the other systems. This allows
e-mail from SNADS to be easily routed through the Exchange Server backbone to
either cc:Mail or SMTP, or vice-versa.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To change a user's target address or to view the user's current target address
or e-mail proxies:

1. In the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program, expand the left panel
  tree until you see the Recipients Container.

2. Select the Recipients Container by highlighting it. You should see a list of
  all users in the right pane of the Administrator.

3. To view a user, double-click that user.

4. At the bottom of the General property page there is a field called E- mail.
  If you click E-mail, the options to "Modify existing e-mail address" and
  "Create new e-mail address" appear.

  If the user is an SNADS user the address will be "SNADS:DGN(DEN)". If the user
  is a cc:Mail user it will be "CCMAIL:Username at Postoffice"

5. Change this to the new address.

If you would like to view a user's other proxies, select the e-mail Addresses
property page. This will show all the user's e-mail proxies.

To change the proxy, double click on the address you want to change, or if you
would like to create multiple proxies for one address type click on the side
button New. When you add more than one proxy of a single type one will be the
primary, and all others will be secondary proxies. Primary Proxies are shown in
bold type, Secondary proxies are shown in normal font. If more than one proxy
exists the Primary will always be used on outbound mail, Secondary will be used
only for inbound address mapping.
