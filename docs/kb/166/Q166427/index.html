SUMMARY
=======

In the Pan Chinese version of Windows NT Workstation version 4.0, system code
pages can only be changed by a user who has Administrator rights. Only a user
with Administrator rights can change the default locale, which includes all the
locale ID changes, font code mapping, font display mapping, and all Vga*.* font
changes. Non-administrators can change the locale, but they can only change the
locale ID and regional settings for their own profile. The font, code, and
display mappings are the defaults set by the administrator. The system default
locale will be unavailable for non-administrators.

Users can change the Date, Calendar, and Number formats only. The Set As System
default locale in the Regional Settings is unavailable.

The system code page and font mapping are based on the administrator settings.

For example, if the System locale is set to Chinese (Taiwan) by the
administrator, all Chinese characters can only be displayed as BIG5 or Unicode
code page format; other Chinese character formats or Chinese applications using
the GB or GBK code pages will display incorrectly.

The administrator can determine what System locale is suitable for his or her
users and install appropriate code page applications for them. Users can alter
the Date, Calendar, and Number (including currency) format by changing the
locale settings.

RESOLUTION
==========

To change the System locale:

1. Log on with Administrator user rights.

2. Click Start and select Settings, and then Control Panel.

3. Click the Regional Settings tab.

4. Select either Chinese (PRC) or Chinese (Taiwan) locale.

5. Check the Set as System default locale box and click the OK button.

6. Restart the computer.

Selected System locale will be activated after restarting.
