SYMPTOMS
========

The migration program stops responding (hangs) and creates a list of Event Log
error messages when it tries to migrate a Word Document from Collabra to a
Microsoft Exchange public folder. It always fails when the migration program
reaches a .doc attachment. The beta version of the same migration program does
not hang. It ignores all Word documents and therefore does not try to migrate
them.

CAUSE
=====

Migration Wizard may hang while migrating Collabra Share forums with Word
attachments. If it doesn't hang, the attachment causes an error on import, and
is not migrated. Collabra treats Word attachments as regular attachments, but
uses a feature of the file format that is associated with OLE presentation data.
This data occurs where other attachment data is expected.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Server
5.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on
