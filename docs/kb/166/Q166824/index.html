SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the minimum Windows NT and Microsoft Exchange permissions
needed in order to perform an on-line backup of a Microsoft Exchange Server
installed on a Windows NT member server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you want to allow a user to perform an on-line backup of a Microsoft Exchange
Server that is installed on a Windows NT member server, that user's Windows NT
domain account must belong to both the domain's Backup Operators group and the
local computer's Backup Operators group.

In order to add the domain account to the local computer's Backup Operators
group, you must login to the local computer, instead of the domain, at the
Windows NT login prompt as the administrator or as an administrator equivalent.
Then start the Windows NT User Manager and add the domain account to the local
computer's Backup Operators group.

No permissions need to be granted for the user account in the Microsoft Exchange
Administrator program.

In order for that same account to be able to restore a Microsoft Exchange backup
on the member server, that account must be added to the local computer's
Administrators group. It is not necessary to add the account to the domain
Administrators or domain Admins groups. The Administrator privilege is necessary
because only Administrators can shut down services in Windows NT and the
Microsoft Exchange services need to be shut down in order to restore Microsoft
Exchange.
