SYMPTOMS
========

When the MFC and CRT (C Run-Time) libraries do not match in debug/release or in
static/dynamic, you get errors such as the following when linking:

  nafxcwd.lib(appcore.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol ___argc

Many other strange problems may erupt during build or runtime: memory corruption,
memory leaks, complaints from the debug C Run-Time libraries during run-time,
and more.

CAUSE
=====

When building an MFC application or DLL, you need to insure that all relevant
libraries are in sync:

- If you have selected to build an application using MFC in the Shared Library,
  then you must also use the dynamic version of the C Run-Time (MSVCRT.DLL).

- If you have selected to build a debug MFC application, then you must also use
  the debug version of the C Run-Time. Similarly, release MFC applications must
  use the non-debug version of the C Run-Time.

- If your debug MFC application uses extension DLLs, every extension DLL must
  be a debug build as well. Again, release apps must match release extension
  DLLs. The type of C Run-Time library is fixed. Extension DLLs and the
  applications which use them must all use MFC in the shared library, which
  requires the dynamic DLL version of the C Run-Time.

- If you are linking to any static libraries that also link to MFC or the CRT,
  you should ensure that every static library shares the same properties
  (debug/release, CRT-static/dynamic) as the application.

RESOLUTION
==========

To change the type of C Run-Time library used by an application or DLL, go to
the Build/Project settings property sheet and switch to the C/C++ tab. On the
C/C++ page, choose the "Code Generation" category. Change the value of the "Use
run-time library" listbox. Pay careful attention to make this specific for each
configuration; only one configuration, such as "Win32 (80x86) Debug," should be
selected when you change this value.

  Debug, shared library MFC applications - "Debug Multithreaded Dll."

  Release, shared library MFC applications - "Multithread Dll."

  Debug, static library MFC applications - "Debug Multithreaded."

  Release, static library MFC applications - "Multithreaded."

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
