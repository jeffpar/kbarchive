-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the following conditions are met, a message coming into a Microsoft Exchange
Server, version 4.0 or 5.0, addressed to:

  C=cc; A=aa; P=pp; O=oo; OU=uu; S=surname

will generate a Non-Delivery Report (NDR) to the originator stating that a loop
was detected:

- The Microsoft Exchange Server's Site Addressing is set to:

     C=cc; A=aa; P=pp; O=oo

- The Microsoft Exchange Server has a single X.400 connector to a X.400
  provider whose Address Space set to:

     C=*

- The X.400 provider forwards all messages with the following address to the
  Microsoft Exchange Server:

     C=cc; A=aa; P=pp

- A mailbox exists on the Microsoft Exchange Server with an X.400 address of:

     C=cc; A=aa; P=pp; O=oo; S=surname

CAUSE
=====

This happens because the recipient address does not exist in the Microsoft
Exchange Directory. The existing mailbox's address does not include OU=uu.
Microsoft Exchange Server sends the message back to the X.400 provider, which
returns it to Microsoft Exchange Server, which then detects the loop.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 4.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

After the hotfix has been applied, the Microsoft Exchange Server will
immediately generate an "Unrecognized OR Name" NDR to avoid the rerouting.
