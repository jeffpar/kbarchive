- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A computer running Windows NT cannot list or attach to some Novell NetWare
servers, although Windows 95-based clients operate successfully.

CAUSE
=====

Client Services for NetWare (CSNW) and Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW)
attach to a default or preferred server. The client then queries that server for
a list of other servers. Windows NT CSNW is only able to connect to servers that
are included in its default or preferred server's service advertising process
(SAP) table. If the segment that the default server is on is not routed or
bridged to the other segments, the server is unaware of the servers on those
segments. To see what servers the default server knows about, type DISPLAY
SERVERS at the NetWare console.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A network configuration may include intermediate devices such as a bridge that
filters IPX SAP broadcasts or routers that are not configured to forward SAP
broadcasts. One NetWare "seed" server can be located on each side of the router.
SAP information is only forwarded to designated "seed" servers.

When a Windows 95 client attaches to one of the "seed" servers, the SAP queries
are performed against the bindery of the server being attached to in order to
obtain the complete SAP table. The Windows 95 redirector performs this operation
successfully through the Map command run from an MS- DOS prompt. This is not
supported under Windows NT because CSNW uses the preferred server for all SAP
queries.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q151236
  TITLE : CSNW/GSNW Will Only Show Servers on One Network

RESOLUTION
==========

Log off and log back on, selecting the desired preferred server.

A command line option is now available to allow CSNW to obtain the SAP table from
a "seed" server. This is only supported with the Net use command. Also, this
capability is only available from the command line and is not supported through
API or through any GUI applications such as the Explorer. The NetWare Map
command does not support this CSNW capability.

To provide support for this new option, first apply the updated Nwrdr.sys file
mentioned below and then perform the following steps:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

  \System\CurrentControlSet\Services\NWRDR\parameters

3. From the Edit menu, click Add Value.

4. Add the following:

     Value Name: AllowSeedServerRedirection
     Data Type:  REG_DWORD
     Data: 0x1 (Hex)

5. Enable the AllowSeedServerRedirection on CSNW; Default is Disabled (0x0)

Command Line Usage
------------------

The following command syntax can be used to access the seed server SAP table:

  net use * \\server(bindery_server)\volume

Where server = the name of a Netware file server containing Volume and
bindery_server = the name of the NetWare seed server.

Net use drivespec /d must be used to disconnect the connection.

Note: This command line option is only intended to provide support through the
net use command. All other NetWare API interoperability is not supported. The
Map command should not be used to remove the connection. Support for this
command option from GUI applications including Explorer is not included.

For example:

Map lists the seed server connection

Drives A,B,C,D,E,F,G,.... map to a local disk.
Drive T: = NetwareServer\PUB: \ 
....
Drive X: = NetwareServerName(SeedServerName)\SYS: \ 

net use lists the "seed" server connection:

Status       Local  Remote                    Network&lt;/H3&gt;
Disconnected F:     \\jsbach\public           Microsoft Windows Network
            V:     \\bullet\pub              NetWare or Compatible Network
            W:     \\bullet(nw41_essbp)\sys  NetWare or Compatible Network

Whoami will return the following error upon completing.

User ID:    UserName
Server:     NetwareServerName   NetWare 4.10
Connection: 3 (Bindery)
Login time: Wednesday 3/05/97 9:47:30 am
....

  WHOAMI-4.1-230: An error occurred during WHOAMI's attempt to get the
  connection status.
