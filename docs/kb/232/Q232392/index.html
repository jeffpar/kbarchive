The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Zone.com 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are in a game lobby or playing a game that is listed on the Zone, you
may experience slow performance, long pauses, or other indications of high
Internet latency.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you are using slow network hardware or if your
Internet connection is slow.

RESOLUTION
==========

Although Internet latency is often beyond anybody's direct control, there are
some steps that you can take to minimize its likelihood.

To troubleshoot this issue, use the following methods.

Quit Unnecessary Programs
-------------------------

Quit any unnecessary programs that are running, especially programs that
frequently send and receive data over the Internet such as e-mail, chat, and
streaming media programs.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Test Your Connection Speed
--------------------------

To test your connection speed, visit the following MSN Web site:

  http://tech.msn.com/internet/speedtest.asp

This Web site tests and displays your line speed. The Zone requires a minimum
line speed of 14.4 kilobits per second (Kbps) and recommends a line speed of
56.0 Kbps.

NOTE: These requirements enable you to connect to the MSN Gaming Zone. Retail
games that support matchmaking on the Zone may have higher system requirements.
Check the system requirements for the game that are printed on the product box.

Restart Your Connection to the Internet and the Zone
----------------------------------------------------

To restart your connection to the Internet and the Zone:

1. Quit your Web browser and any other programs that are running.

2. Right-click the Zone.com icon on the taskbar, and then click Exit.

3. Disconnect from the Internet.

4. Reconnect to the Internet.

5. Connect to the Zone, and then sign in.

If the issue continues to occur, try to connect to the Zone at a later time. If
the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Update Your Internet Service Provider (ISP) Software
----------------------------------------------------

If you use an ISP (such as America Online) that uses proprietary software to
connect to the Internet, you may be able to obtain and install a patch or
software update that reduces Internet latency.

Use a Different ISP
-------------------

If you continue to experience Internet latency problems with your ISP, you may
want to consider using a different ISP.

Install the Latest Version of Microsoft DirectX
-----------------------------------------------

The latest version of DirectX includes an updated version of DirectPlay. Many of
the games on the Zone use DirectPlay to share information with other computers
during multiplayer games.

To install the latest version of DirectPlay, download and install the latest
version of DirectX from the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/directx/homeuser/downloads/default.asp

Configure TCP/IP to Be Your Default Network Protocol
----------------------------------------------------

TCP/IP is the standard network protocol used on the Internet. If multiple network
protocols are installed on your computer, configure TCP/IP to be your default
network protocol to increase the efficiency of your Internet connection. To do
this:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Network.

3. In the list of installed network components, click the TCP/IP protocol bound
  to the network adapter you use to connect to the Internet, and then click
  Properties.

4. Click the Advanced tab.

5. Click to select the "Set this protocol to be the default protocol" check box,
  click OK, and then click OK again.

6. Restart the computer.

Obtain a Firmware Update for Your Network Hardware
--------------------------------------------------

Firmware or driver updates are available for network hardware to increase the
hardware's speed or to correct issues. Contact the manufacturer of your network
hardware to inquire about how to obtain and install the latest updates.

If no updates are available, you may want to obtain upgraded hardware.

For information about how to contact the manufacturer of your network hardware,
click the appropriate article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q60781 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, L-P

  Q60782 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, Q-Z

Use a Bus Mastering PCI Network Interface Card
----------------------------------------------

If you are using a Network Interface Card to connect to the Internet, use a PCI
card that supports bus mastering. Transmission of data across the bus is more
efficient with a PCI card than with an ISA card.

Also, bus mastering enables the card to operate independently from the processor.
A PCI card that supports bus mastering ensures that your network information is
readily transmitted and received when the CPU is near its maximum capacity.
