The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes procedures for manually configuring the server service.

There may be times when it is necessary to configure the server service during a
scripted, or unattended install.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To configure the Server service, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Network.

2. On the Services tab, click the Server service, and then click Properties.

3. There are four configuration options for the Server service listed here:

  a. Minimize Memory Used

  b. Balance

  c. Maximize Throughput for File Sharing

  d. Maximize Throughput for Network Applications

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

When you configure one of the four options for the Server service, the
information is saved to the following two registry keys:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\lanmanserver\parameters\size

Your choices for this registry key are 1,2 and 3.

  1 = Minimize Memory Used
  2 = Balance
  3 = Maximize Throughput for File Sharing and Maximize Throughput for Network
  Applications

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory
  Management\LargeSystemCache

Your choices for this registry key are 0 and 1.

  1 = Maximize Throughput for File Sharing
  0 = Maximize Throughput for Network Applications

Some programs, such as SQL and Exchange, set this value during an installation.
For these programs, the optimal setting is 0.
0 = Indicates that the computer does not go outside its cache pool and use
program memory to perform I/O functions.

1 = Indicates that the computer looks outside of its cache pool and uses program
memory to perform I/O functions. This occurs if the cache is full.

The Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit contains a tool called Regini.exe, which can be
used to script changes to the registry. For information about this tool, please
refer to the Regini.doc file or type "regini /?" (without the quotation marks)
at the command prompt.
