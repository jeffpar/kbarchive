- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When placing controls on a tab control, the Validate event is fired every time
you shift the focus from one control to another, or when changing the visible
tab.

If one of the controls placed on the Tab control is a FlexGrid control then the
validate events are not fired correctly when moving from one tab to another
using the mouse. Although they work fine if shortcuts are used on the tab's
captions and the keyboard is used to move between tabs.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use other events such as lost focus to simulate validation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new standard .exe project.

2. Select the Microsoft Flex Grid Control 6.0 and the Microsoft Tabbed Dialog
  Control 6.0 from the Components List under the Project menu.

3. Place the Microsoft Tabbed Dialog Control on your form.

4. Place two text boxes on a tab.

5. On the same tab place the Microsoft Flex Grid Control.

6. Set the CausesValidation property to True on all controls, including the tab
  control.

7. Add a text box to the form. Call it txtLog, set Text="" and set multiline to
  True.

8. On the Validate event from each control (including the Tab control), write a
  line to the txtLog control so that you can see when such events are firing as
  shown below:

  Option Explicit

  Private Sub MSFlexGrid1_Validate(Cancel As Boolean)
  txtlog = txtlog &amp; "MSFlexGrid1 Validate" &amp; vbCrLf
  End Sub

  Private Sub SSTab1_Validate(Cancel As Boolean)
  txtlog = txtlog &amp; "SSTab1 Validate" &amp; vbCrLf
  End Sub

  Private Sub Text1_Validate(Cancel As Boolean)
  txtlog = txtlog &amp; "Text1 Validate" &amp; vbCrLf
  End Sub

  Private Sub Text2_Validate(Cancel As Boolean)
  txtlog = txtlog &amp; "Text2 Validate" &amp; vbCrLf
  End Sub

9. Change the caption for each tab to:

  &amp;A, &amp;B, &amp;C

  So that you can change the visible tab with the keyboard.

10. Save and then run the project.

11. Click on Text1, Text2 and the grid - validate events are being fired as
  expected. Click tab B. You will notice that no validate event was fired.

12. Return to Tab A and click Text1. Now turn to Tab B using the keyboard (Alt +
  B). The validate event was fired.

13. Create another project similar to this one, without a FlexGrid, and
  everything will work as expected.
