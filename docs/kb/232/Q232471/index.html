-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you replicate items from Exchange Server to Lotus Notes and vice versa, the
dates and times of items being replicated may appear incorrect. They may appear
with a time difference that depends on their local time zone relative to the
Greenwich mean time.

For example, the times are five hours apart if the server is located on the East
Coast, but eight hours apart if the server is located in the Pacific time zone.

CAUSE
=====

When you replicate from Exchange Server to Notes, the custom time and date
properties undergo an erroneous Greenwich mean time translation. When you
replicate from Notes to Exchange Server, Notes time and date stamps without
specific date values (that is, editable Time field entry) do not go through a
needed Greenwich mean time translation.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

WORKAROUND
==========

By using the @Created formula in the SubDate field instead of a computed time
entry within your form, you can resolve the time discrepancy error when
replicating data from Notes to Exchange Server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 3.
