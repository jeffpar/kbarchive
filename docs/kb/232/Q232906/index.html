SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect to a network resource using a UNC path, you may
receive an error message stating that the network path was not found, and the
name of the missing file is the name of the shared folder.pif file.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if you are using WRQ Reflections NFS Client 7.0, and the
network resource that you are connecting to is using an NFS file system that was
exported using complex syntax, and a directory delimiter appears in the export
name.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, contact the administrator of the NFS server and see if
the administrator can export the file system using simple syntax, or you can
browse to the NFS server you want using Network Neighborhood, and then map a
drive letter.
