A MAKE file built with PWB can be modified (within reason) with the
user supplied information section. This section, coded as

  # &lt;&lt; User_supplied_information &gt;&gt;


can contain other instructions that PWB (actually NMAKE or NMK) is
supposed to carry out during the MAKE cycle. All instructions that
follow this "fence" are not changed by PWB.

The following instructions detail two implementations of this "fence"
to allow PWB to build a program that uses overlays.

MORE INFORMATION
================

While the following steps appear tedious, they are simple in practice.

Once the changes are made, the only time you need to edit the MAKE file directly
is to change your overlay structure, or to add or delete modules. When adding or
deleting modules, you must both edit the program list (by choosing Edit Program
List from the Make menu) and modify the commands in the user section. If you are
only modifying the overlay structure, you change just the user section.

The overlay structure in the example is as follows:

     HELLO.OBJ  (root)
   
         |
         +----A.OBJ (first overlay)
         |
         +----B.OBJ (second overlay)

All of the .OBJs are built from .C files with the same base name.

1. Use PWB to build the program list in the normal way. This step is the same
  for any new program list.

  a. Start PWB.

  b. Choose Set Program List from the Make menu, and specify a new name --
     HELLO.MAK in this example.

  c. Add HELLO.C, A.C, and B.C to the list. (If you have additional .C or .OBJ
     files, you would add them as well.) When all the files are listed, select
     Set Dependencies.

  d. Choose Build Options from the Options menu, click the Set Initial Build
     Options button, and select DOS EXE.

  e. From the Options menu, choose Compile Options, and select the proper
     memory model.

  f. From Options menu, choose Link Options, then choose Set Debug Options, and
     turn off Incremental Link.

  g. From the Options menu, choose Browse Options, and turn Generate Browse
     Information on.

  h. Choose Rebuild All from the Make menu to make sure that the program builds
     properly without overlays. If it doesn't, review your work in previous
     steps.

2. Now that you have a working program list, add the non-PWB information to the
  end.

  a. Choose Clear Program List from the Make menu so that you can edit the MAKE
     file. Attempting to edit the current program list results in the message
     "No-edit file may not be modified."

  b. Choose Open from the File menu to open the MAKE file so you can modify it.

  c. Go to the end of the file and start a blank line. Starting in column 1,
     add the following line:

  " # &lt;&lt; User_supplied_information &gt;&gt;" (without the quotation
  marks)

     Be sure to enter the line exactly as shown -- spacing is significant. This
     line is a "fence". Everything below the fence is yours and is not modified
     by PWB. Conversely, you should not modify anything above the fence because
     that section belongs to PWB.

  d. Below the fence starting in column one, add the pseudo-target:

  " OVERLAID : $(OBJS)" (without the quotation marks)

     Be sure it starts column 1. Do not put a blank line after this line.

  e. Copy the command section from the $(PROJ).EXE description block to
     immediately follow the pseudo-target. The command section begins on the
     line following the line that reads

  $(PROJ).exe : $(OBJS)

     and ends at the next blank line. Do not copy the $(PROJ).EXE line, and do
     not leave a blank after the target. After you have copied the commands,
     your file should appear as follows:

              ... PWB section here, unmodified ...

           # &lt;&lt; User_supplied_information &gt;&gt;

           OVERLAID : $(OBJS)
           !IF $(DEBUG)                    # copy of commands...
                   $(LRF) @&lt;&lt;$(PROJ).lrf
           $(RT_OBJS: = +^
           ) $(OBJS: = +^
           )
           $@
           ...

  f. Use the following procedure to modify the commands to link an overlaid
     .EXE instead of a normal .EXE.

     NOTE: There are two subsections in this section: a debug section that
     starts at the first "!IF $(DEBUG)" and ends at "!ELSE", and a release
     section that starts after the "!ELSE" and ends at the first "!ENDIF".

     You need to make the following modifications to both subsections.

     a. Delete the line that reads as follows:

              ) $(OBJS: = +^

        After the right parenthesis on the line that moved up, put your list of
        .OBJ files with parentheses to indicate which ones go in which
        overlays. If you need to use more than one line for all of your
        objects, be sure to put a plus sign (+) at the end of each line except
        the last.

     b. Replace "$@" on the next line with "$(PROJ).EXE".

  In our example,

                               $(LRF) @&lt;&lt;$(PROJ).lrf
              $(RT_OBJS: = +^
              ) $(OBJS: = +^     # delete this line
              )                  # append OBJ list here ...
              $@                 # replace this line with $(PROJ).EXE

  becomes:

                  $(LRF) @&lt;&lt;$(PROJ).lrf
              $(RT_OBJS: = +^
              ) hello.obj +
              (a.obj) +
              (b.obj)
              $(PROJ).exe

        Remember to make the changes in both branches of the !IF $(DEBUG).

3. The last step is to modify the browser database build commands. These are the
  two lines at the very end of the file that begin with "$(NMAKEBSC...". PWB
  adds and deletes these lines in the PWB section as you turn browser
  information on and off.

  Since PWB won't delete and add these lines in the user section, enclose them
  in !IF $(BROWSE)...!ENDIF so they'll be run only when you ask for browse
  information. You also need to delete the "$(NMFLAGS)" macro from the second
  line to prevent infinite NMAKE recursion.

  The following lines

           $(NMAKEBSC1) MAKEFLAGS=
           $(NMAKEBSC2) $(NMFLAGS) -f $(PROJFILE) $(PROJ).bsc

  become:

           !IF $(BROWSE)
               $(NMAKEBSC1) MAKEFLAGS=
               $(NMAKEBSC2) -f $(PROJFILE) $(PROJ).bsc
           !ENDIF

  If you need special NMAKE options for building the browser database, just add
  them where you removed $(NMFLAGS).

4. Reactivate the MAKE file by choosing Set Program List from the Make menu.

5. With these changes, if you choose select Rebuild All from the Make menu, you
  will still get a non-overlaid program because PWB normally builds the first
  target in the MAKE file. To build the overlaid program, modify the command
  line passed to NMAKE so that NMAKE builds your overlay target rather than the
  regular EXE. Choose NMAKE Options from the Options menu and specify
  "OVERLAID" as the target by putting it in the NMAKE options box, or use Build
  Target from the Make menu.

6. By choosing NMAKE Options from the Options menu and specifying "OVERLAID",
  you can build your program by either choosing Rebuild All or Build *.EXE from
  the Make menu, as usual. If you want to build a non-overlaid program, delete
  "OVERLAID" from the NMAKE options box.

  Note that if you use debug options with overlays you will get a linker warning
  L4047. This warning, and the dialog box that says that CRT0DAT.ASM can't be
  found, are normal when building overlaid programs for debugging and can be
  ignored. You can debug the overlaid program normally, with full debugging
  information available.

  This MAKE file behaves almost identically to a regular PWB MAKE file. The only
  differences are that NMAKE options are NOT passed to the browser build unless
  you add them to the browser build line, and that you must edit the user
  supplied section if you add or delete modules from the project.
