In the QBX.EXE editor, the Near Strings hotkey (ALT+N) in the Make EXE
File dialog box does not move the option marker to the Near Strings
option -- only the cursor is moved to the option. The arrow keys must
be used to change this option.

All other hotkeys -- ALT+F for Far Strings, ALT+A for Alternate Math
and so on -- move the option marker to the desired option. Only the
Near Strings hotkey (ALT+N) does not.

To work around this problem, use the arrow keys to move to the Near
Strings option. (The arrows can be used for any of the choices.)

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the QBX.EXE
environment that comes with Microsoft BASIC Professional Development
System (PDS) version 7.00. This problem was corrected in QBX.EXE in
BASIC PDS 7.10.
