The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.1, 3.2, 3.21, 3.3, 3.3a, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22

SUMMARY
=======

The Western Digital 8-bit hard disk controller card ROM contains a low-level
formatting utility. This utility can be started using the Microsoft MS-DOS DEBUG
utility. Western Digital 16-bit controller cards need a disk-based formatter to
do the low-level formatting.

For more information, contact Western Digital technical support and information
center.

NOTE: Use the method listed below at your own risk.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use the following procedure to perform a low-level format:

1. Start DEBUG by typing the following at the command prompt:

  " debug" (without the quotation marks)

2. At the DEBUG hyphen (-) prompt, type one of the following commands:

  " G=C800:5
  G=CA00:5
  G=CC00:5
  G=CE00:5" (without the quotation marks)

  The above commands execute instructions starting at either location C800:0005,
  CA00:0005, CC00:0005, or CE00:0005, depending on which address is selected.
  If the computer freezes with the first address listed above, try the second
  address.

The program in the controller's ROM will execute and will query for interleave
factor and other parameters. Answer these as appropriate; the hard disk will
then be low-level formatted.

The following addresses are valid for BIOS low-level format routines on Western
Digital hard disk controller cards when using DEBUG.COM to perform a low-level
format:

  Address    Description
  ----------------------
  C800:5     Used by most Western Digital hard disk controllers for
             XT- and AT-compatible computers, including all WD-1007A
             series cards
  CA00:5     Alternate address used on some XT hard disk controller
             cards
  CC00:5     WD-1007V-SE1 and WD-1007V-SE2 controllers;
             WD-1003V-SR and WD-1006V-SR controllers, Revision F003
             and F005 only (other SR-series controllers do not have
             onboard BIOS)
  CE00:5     Alternate address used on some XT hard disk controller
             cards

The above information is valid not only for hard disk controller cards marketed
directly by Western Digital, but also for hard disk controllers manufactured by
Western Digital for other companies. For example, the Seagate ST-01 and ST-02
hard disk controllers are manufactured by Western Digital.

The addresses noted above as alternate addresses can usually be selected by
installing jumpers on the hard disk controller card, for controllers that have
alternate addresses. If the jumper on a card with alternate address capability
is left disconnected, the default address (C800:5) is used.

no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this information's accuracy or
usefulness. This information is supplied only for your convenience.
