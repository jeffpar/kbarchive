The newest versions of the memory management utilities (HIMEM.SYS,
RAMDRIVE.SYS, and SMARTDRV.SYS) should be used at all times. For
instance, if you use CodeView Version 3.00 (first shipped with
Microsoft C Version 6.00) and you use a version of HIMEM.SYS earlier
than what was shipped with the C 6.00 package, you may experience a
number of problems, including the following:

1. You may get spurious error messages such as "Not enough extended
   memory available," even if you have more than enough extended
   memory installed.

2. You may receive the error "CV1319: CodeView initialization error"
   when trying to invoke CodeView.

3. Your computer may hang or reboot.

As memory management technology progresses, the Microsoft tools and
utilities that use the technology are also updated. Therefore, it is
critical that the latest versions of the memory utilities (HIMEM.SYS,
RAMDRIVE.SYS, SMARTDRV.SYS, etc.) be installed. Tools such as CodeView
and the Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) depend on features that are
available only in the latest versions.
