SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows version 3.0 provides integrated support for the following
networks:

  3Com 3+Open LAN Manager
  3Com 3+Share
  Banyon VINES 4.0
  LAN Manager 1.x (or 100 percent compatible)
  LAN Manager 2.0 Basic (or 100 percent compatible)
  LAN Manager 2.0 Enhanced (or 100 percent compatible)
  Microsoft Network (or 100 percent compatible)
  Novell NetWare 2.1 or above, or Novell NetWare 386
  IBM PC-LAN Program
  Others, as supported by manufacturers' installation disks

Windows 3.0 retains information regarding what network it is currently configured
for in the SYSTEM.INI file, which should be located in the \WINDOWS directory.
The information below attempts to give guidance regarding the settings in that
file that directly affect network support and performance. Windows 3.0 provides
different levels of support (different features) for different networks. The
sample settings provided below are characteristic of an 80386 system with
extended memory, capable of running in 386 enhanced mode.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The sections and settings that describe the network configuration in SYSTEM.INI
are:

    [boot]
       network.drv
    [boot.description]
       network.drv=
    [386Enh]
       network=

If LAN Manager version 1.0 or 1.01 is installed, the settings are:

    [boot]
      network.drv=msnet.drv
    [boot.description]
      network.drv=LAN Manager 1.x (or 100 percent compatible)
    [386Enh]
      networks=*vnetbios, *dosnet, lanman10.386

If LAN Manager version 2.0 Basic is installed, the settings are:

     [boot]
       network.drv=msnet.drv
     [boot.description]
       network.drv=LAN Manager 2.00 BASIC (or 100 percent compatible)
     [386Enh]
       network=*vnetbios, *dosnet

If LAN Manager version 2.0 Enhanced is installed, the settings are:

      [boot]
        network.drv=lanman.drv
      [boot.description]
         network.drv=LAN Manager 2.00 Enhanced (or 100 percent compatible)
      [386Enh]
         network=*vnetbios,*dosnet

If MS-NET is installed, the settings are:

       [boot]
         network.drv=msnet.drv
       [boot.description]
         network.drv=Microsoft Network (or 100 percent compatible)
       [386Enh]
         network=*vnetbios,*dosnet

Although checking the settings may give you an indication of what might be wrong,
simply running the Windows Setup utility is an easy way to ensure that the
customer has actually installed the package for the correct network software. It
takes less than a minute to load Setup and reconfigure, as the network options
are available on the first screen, and it exits to DOS immediately upon the user
confirming his or her choice.
