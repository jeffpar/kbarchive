The following information is taken from the C Version 6.00 STARTUP.DOC
file.

C Run-Time Library Startup Sources
----------------------------------

The directory \startup and its subdirectories contain the files
necessary for building the startup portion of the C run-time library.
The \startup directory contains the startup source files, the include
files, the batch file, and the make file used to build the startup
object files. The subdirectories of \startup contain OS specific
sources.

The startup object files can be built by invoking STARTUP.BAT (DOS) or
STARTUP.CMD (OS/2) from within the \startup directory. This batch file
assumes the following:

1. NMAKE.EXE, NMK.COM, LINK.EXE, the C compiler, and the assembler
   must be in the execution path. MASM 5.00 and C 6.00 or later are
   required to build the startup sources.

2. For OS/2, OS2.LIB must be in the directory specified by the LIB
   environment variable.

3. Environment variable INCLUDE must be set to the directory that
   contains your C include files.

Startup will create four memory model specific subdirectories (i.e.,
S, M, C, and L) and place the appropriate object files there. Under
each memory model subdirectory, startup creates two additional
subdirectories, OS2 and DOS, where OS specific objects reside.

The include files STDIO.H and CTYPE.H are required for building the
startup source file WILD.C but are not included on the \startup
directory because they exist on the directory containing the standard
include files. A make variable called CINC controls where the makefile
looks for these include files. STARTUP sets CINC to the current value
of the INCLUDE environment variable. This variable should be set to
the location of the C include files. CINC can also be set in the
makefile if you wish to run the makefile separately.

The message "&lt;cEnd - nogen&gt;" is generated when some of the assembly
language source files are assembled. This message is expected and is
totally benign.

The startup batch file requires as arguments a list of capital letters
describing the memory models you wish to build. For example, "startup
S L" will build the small and large model startup objects. Startup
will then link the objects with a sample C program called NULBODY.C
(consisting of a null main functions) to produce NULBODY.EXE.
[Invoking startup.&lt;bat,cmd&gt; with no arguments will give usage
information.]

If you wish to build startup sources for only one operating system
(i.e. DOS or OS/2), type "DOS" or "OS2" as the first argument to the
startup batch file.

Note: Startup sources written in assembly language have been edited
with tab stops set to 8. Startup sources written in C have been edited
with tab stops set to 4.

The following files are contained in the \startup directory:

Startup source files (OS independent):

  rchkstk.asm
  fmsghdr.asm
  chkstk.asm
  chksum.asm
  crt0fp.asm
  setargv.asm
  wild.c

Startup source files (OS specific):

  crt0.asm
  crt0dat.asm
  crt0msg.asm
  execmsg.asm  (DOS only)
  nmsghdr.asm
  stdalloc.asm
  stdenvp.asm
  stdargv.asm

Startup include files:

  cmacros.inc
  heap.inc
  msdos.inc
  msdos.h
  register.h
  rterr.inc
  version.inc

File count files:

  _file.c
  file2.h

Make and batch files:

   startup.bat:  Builds objs and links null program on DOS
   startup.cmd:  Builds objs and links null program on OS/2
   makefile:     Contains rules for building startup sources
   nulbody.c:    Null c program
   nulbody.lnk:  Link script for linking null program
