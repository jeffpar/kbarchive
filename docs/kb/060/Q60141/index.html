When using the HELPMAKE.EXE utility (for modifying the online Help
system of QBX.EXE environment), the ":p" command does not work as
described on Page 681 of the "Microsoft BASIC 7.0: Programmer's
Guide." The ":p" is described as setting a screen break for the Help
environment. If ":p" is used, the Help environment behaves as if it
were not used.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with HELPMAKE in
Microsoft Professional Development System (PDS) versions 7.00 and 7.10
for MS-DOS. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here as it becomes available.

A workaround for this problem is to use the ":ln" command, which is
also described on Page 681 of the "Microsoft BASIC 7.0: Programmer's
Guide" for BASIC PDS 7.00 and 7.10. The ":ln" command specifies the
size of the help window, where "n" is the number of lines. If this
command is used, the size of the window is n + 1. If you want
something to show up on the next page, you must have n + 1 number of
lines before the next page. If this option is not used, the size of
the window will default to the number of lines in the Help screen + 1,
with 19 being the maximum number of lines.

For any of the ":" commands described on Page 681 to take effect,
HELPMAKE must be invoked with the /Ac option as described on Page 673.

Note: HELPMAKE.EXE is the Microsoft Help File Maintenance Utility.
HELPMAKE version 1.04 is shipped with BASIC PDS 7.00, and HELPMAKE
version 1.05 is shipped with BASIC PDS 7.10.
