-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you switch between the Client for NFS service and the Gateway for NFS service
in the same installation maintenance session, the newly installed service may
not function as expected.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur if all of the registry items are not updated correctly
after you remove one of the services. Some registry values that have been
modified may remain. These modified registry values may not apply to the new
service, which may prevent the new service from functioning as expected.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you switch between these services, separate the removal process and
installation process of each service. Use Add/Remove Programs to remove the
service that is being replaced, close Add/Remove Programs, and then start
Add/Remove Programs again to add the new service.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows Services for UNIX includes Client for NFS and Gateway for NFS. You can
install only one of these services on a single computer. If you install Gateway
for NFS, this service acts as the NFS client for the computer.
