SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain situations, User Datagram Protocol (UDP) network packets may be
discarded during a Remote Access Service (RAS) connection if the lower byte of
the source port of the UDP package equals 137.

CAUSE
=====

The component checks only the low byte of the source port to decide if a packet
is a NetBIOS packet. This can cause a false positive test because the source
port field is two bytes long.
