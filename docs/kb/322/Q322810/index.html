-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade your computer from Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 to Microsoft
Windows 2000, certain Windows Services For UNIX 3.0 components no longer
function optimally.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, remove and then reinstall these components to replace the
Windows NT 4.0-specific components with Windows 2000-specific Windows Services
For UNIX components. Use the Add/Remove Programs tool in Control Panel to remove
the following components if they are installed on the system:

  Client for NFS
  Gateway For NFS
  Telnet Server

After you have removed these components, use Add/Remove Programs to reinstall
these components. This method will upgrade the services to the Windows
2000-specific components.

NOTE: If you run the Installation Wizard and select Reinstall/Repair, this method
does not upgrade these components.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows NT 4.0 Windows Services For UNIX binaries listed in the "Resolution"
section of this article will run on either Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000-based
systems. However, Microsoft recommends that you individually upgrade these
components after you upgrade to Windows 2000. Windows 2000 supports the /robust
switch. This flag tells the Microsoft Interface Definition Language (MIDL)
compiler to generate additional error-checking information, which the Network
Data Representation (NDR) engine uses to perform integrity checks at run time.
The /robust switch is available only under Windows 2000. These components were
compiled by using the /robust switch.

For more information about /robust, MIDL, and NDR, visit the following Microsoft
