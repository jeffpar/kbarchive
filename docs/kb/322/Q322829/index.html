RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the steps in the following methods, in the order in
which they are presented.

NOTE: Before you continue with the following methods, Microsoft recommends that
you perform a full backup, to prevent data loss.

Method 1: Remove the Corrupted Mail Item
----------------------------------------

Use the Microsoft Exchange Messaging Database (MDB) Viewer utility (Mdbvu32.exe)
to remove any messages from the BAD folder. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Download the Profinst utility. To do this, visit the following Microsoft Web
  site:

  DownloadDownload Profinst.exe now
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/exch50/Utility/1/NT4/EN-US/Profinst.exe)

Microsoft scanned this file for viruses. Microsoft used the most current
virus-detection software that was available on the date that the file was
posted. The file is stored on secure servers that prevent any unauthorized
changes to the file.

2. At a command prompt, change to the folder that contains the Profinst.exe
  file, and then type the following command, where &lt;ims&gt; is the test
  profile that you want to create:

  profinst /service=msexchangeimc /name=&lt;ims&gt; /type=gateway

3. Start the Mdbvu32.exe program. Mdbvu32.exe is on the Exchange Server 5.5
  CD-ROM in the Server\Support\Utils\I386 folder. You can run the tool directly
  from the CD-ROM, or you can copy the following files to a specific folder,
  and then run Mdbvu32 from that folder:

  Mdbvu32.exe
  Propvu32.dll
  Statvu32.dll
  Tblvu32.dll
  Xvport.dll

4. In the "MAPILogonEx(MAPI_LOGON_UI)" dialog box, click to select the
  MAPI_EXPLICIT_PROFILE check box, and then click OK.

5. In the "Profile name" list, click the profile that you created with the
  Profinst tool (for example, click "ims"), and then click OK.

6. On the MDB menu, click OpenMessageStore.

7. Click "Mailbox - Internet Mail Service (&lt;ServerName&gt;)", and then click
  Open.

  NOTE: If "Mailbox - Internet Mail Service (ServerName)" is not displayed,
  click Private Folders, and then click Open.

8. On the MDB menu, click Open Root Folder.

9. In the Child Folders box, click Bad.

10. In the "Messages in Folder" list, click a message.

11. In the "Operations available" list, click IpFld-&gt;DeleteMessages(), click
  Call Function, and then click OK to confirm the message deletion.

12. When you finish deleting the messages from the Bad folder, click Close.

13. On the Session menu, click Exit, click OK in the IpMDB-&gt;StoreLogoff()
  dialog box, and then click OK.

Mail Service" section of this article.
