-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Streets &amp; Trips 2002, version 1.0 
- Microsoft MapPoint 2002 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to start Streets &amp; Trips 2002 or MapPoint 2002 for the first
time, an hourglass appears, and then the program stops responding.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the Riched32.dll file is missing or corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, extract a copy of Riched32.dll from your Microsoft
Windows CD-ROM. To do this, follow these steps.

NOTE: Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following
steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product
documentation to complete these steps.

Locate the Riched32.dll File
----------------------------

1. Click Start, point to Search, and then click "For Files or Folders".

2. In the Named box, type "riched32.dll" (without the quotation marks), and then
  click Search Now.

  NOTE: If you do not see Riched32.dll in the list of found files, proceed
  directly to the next section, "Extract the Riched32.dll File."

  If you do see Riched32.dll in the list of found files, continue to follow
  these steps.

  The problem should be resolved at this point.

3. In the list of found files, right-click Riched32.dll, and then click Rename.

4. In the box that appears, type "riched32.old" (without the quotation marks),
  and then press ENTER.

  NOTE: If you receive an error message that states that "access is denied" when
  you try to rename the Riched32.dll file, follow these steps:

  a. Click Start, and then click Shut Down.

  b. In the Shut Down Windows dialog box, click "Restart in MS-DOS mode", and
     then click OK.

  c. At the command prompt, type the following commands, pressing ENTER after
