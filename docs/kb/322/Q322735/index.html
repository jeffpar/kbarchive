-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX, version 3.0 
- Interix versions 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.3, 2.2.4, 2.2.4.03, 2.2.4.08, 2.2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can upgrade to Windows Services for UNIX (SFU) 3.0 from Microsoft Interix
2.2, but you cannot upgrade from earlier versions. You must remove earlier
versions before you install Windows SFU 3.0. Note that Cron functionality is
affected in several ways.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SFU 3.0 uses a different method for storing passwords for the Cron service. Cron
users must re-enter their passwords by using the "crontab -p" (without the
quotation marks) command. Also, note that the CRONADMIN utility is not included
in SFU 3.0.

User-Specific Cron Services Not Upgraded
----------------------------------------

If you install Windows SFU 3.0 as an upgrade of Interix 2.2, user-specific Cron
services that were created by Interix 2.2 are not modified or upgraded to work
with Windows SFU 3.0.

1. To list user-specific cron services, type "/bin/service list" (without the
  quotation marks) at an Interix shell prompt. The names of user-specific cron
  services are listed in this format

  cron_&lt;domain name&gt;+&lt;user&gt;

  where &lt;domain name&gt; is the name of the user's domain and &lt;user&gt; is
  the user's logon name.

2. After you identify these services, remove them by running the "/bin/service
  remove &lt;service name&gt;" (without the quotation marks) command at an
  Interix shell prompt for each service, where &lt;service name&gt; is the name
  of the service to be removed.

3. After you remove the service, the user who owned the service must reinstall
  the user's Crontab file by running the "crontab -e" (without the quotation
  marks) command at an Interix shell prompt.

4. The user who owned the service must register the user's password by running
  the "crontab -p" (without the quotation marks) command at an Interix shell
  prompt. The user's Crontab file is generally located in the following folder
  in the Interix 2.2 installation folder:

  usr/lib/cron/user

  The Crontab file has the same name as the user's fully qualified domain name
  (&lt;domain name&gt;+&lt;user name&gt;).
