SUMMARY
=======

Sometimes network DDE (NDDE) conversations do not appear in the Windows for
Workgroups Net Watcher. This happens because Net Watcher only displays NDDE
conversations in which your computer is the DDE server. For example, if you look
at Net Watcher during a Windows for Workgroups Chat session, Net Watcher
displays the NDDE connection if you are the computer that answers (the server).
Net Watcher does not display the NDDE connection if you are the computer that
dials (the client).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows APIs called by Net Watcher only return information about NDDE
clients of the computer it is running on (in other words, servers to your
computer). Net Watcher does not access information about NDDE conversations
where the local computer is the DDE client. This feature allows Net Watcher to
monitor outside, or incoming, access to your shared directories. Net Watcher
does not monitor outgoing connections initiated by your computer. In other
words, Net Watcher monitors "who is using your computer," but it does not
monitor "what you are using."

This Net Watcher functionality can be somewhat confusing when you use an
application such as Chat, which does not appear to be a client-server
application.
