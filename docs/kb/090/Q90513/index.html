The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to run the real mode network redirector, NET.EXE, from a
network installation of Windows for Workgroups on a Novell network, you may
receive the following error message:

  MS-DOS error SYS0002 occurred trying to open the file "x:\system.ini"

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because NET.EXE starts from your shared Windows for Workgroups
directory and your personal copy of the SYSTEM.INI file is located in your
personal Windows for Workgroups directory.

WORKAROUND
==========

To run the real mode redirector successfully, you need to add a search drive
that includes both the SYSTEM.INI and NET.EXE files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After Windows for Workgroups installation, a typical NetWare search path might
look as follows:

  SEARCH1:=Z:.[XXX\SYS:PUBLIC \]
  SEARCH2:=Y:.[XXX\SYS:USER\JEFF\WFWG\] - (User directory. Setup /N)
  SEARCH3:=X:.[XXX\SYS:WINDOWS\WFWG\] - (Shared directory. Setup /A)
  and so on

When you start the redirector by typing

  net start workstation

NET.EXE is first found on drive X. Drive X only contains the expanded Windows for
Workgroups files with no specific installation information. Your SYSTEM.INI file
is actually located on drive Y.

To successfully start the real mode network redirector, make sure both NET.EXE
and SYSTEM.INI are located on a drive together. The boot drive (drive C
typically) is a good drive for this. To start the redirector, change to drive C
first, or add drive C to your NetWare search path prior to the shared Windows
for Workgroups directory:

  SEARCH1:=Z:.[XXX\SYS:PUBLIC \]
  SEARCH2:=Y:.[XXX\SYS:USER\JEFF\WFWG\] - (User directory. Setup /N)
  SEARCH3:=C:\ - (Location of NET.EXE and SYSTEM.INI)
  SEARCH4:=X:.[XXX\SYS:WINDOWS\WFWG\] - (Shared directory. Setup /A)
  and so on
