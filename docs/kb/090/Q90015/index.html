-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows Sound System, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

During Windows Sound System version 1.0 installation, Setup may restart Windows
so that you can install the sound driver. Before you restart Windows, Setup puts
a Sound System Setup icon in the Startup group, allowing Setup to continue after
Windows restarts.

A conflict can arise if you also have Microsoft Mail in your Startup group. As
Windows restarts, it loads Mail, and you are prompted to enter your password.
Then the Windows Sound System Setup begins. When Setup completes and you choose
the Restart Windows button, the following message displays:

  Stop: An action in Mail must be completed before exiting Windows

If you choose OK, the following message displays:

  Windows could not exit successfully. Please close any running applications
  and MS-DOS sessions and try again.

An immediate solution is to choose the Exit Setup button. This returns you to the
Mail dialog box where you can choose the Cancel button or enter your password.
The Windows Sound System installation is complete; however, the changes made by
Setup do not take effect until you restart Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This situation also occurs when you are running the Windows Sound System Setup
program from MS-DOS while Mail is in the Startup group. Other possible solutions
are:

- When you are prompted with the message:

  Windows could not exit successfully. Please close any running applications
  and MS-DOS sessions and try again.

  press CTRL+ESC. In the Task List, select Microsoft Mail from the list of
  active tasks, and choose the End Task button.

- When Microsoft Mail prompts you for your password, choose the Cancel button.
