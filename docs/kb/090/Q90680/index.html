-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 2.0, 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 2.0 through 3.1, it is
possible for the Network Manager to change the name of his/her mailbox. This
feature allows the person designated as the Network Manager to send and receive
mail under his/her own mailbox name and still receive status messages as the
Network Manager.

If the Network Manager's mailbox name has been customized, it may be difficult to
determine who the Network Manager is. The following procedure helps determine
which user is the designated Network Manager.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This procedure uses the custom Inquiry form to send an automatically addressed
message to the Network Manager. The Network Manager's identity can be determined
by reviewing a copy of the Inquiry message in the Sent Mail folder.

Login to the Microsoft Mail server as any user. Choose Preferences from the Mail
menu and click the Send icon. Select the Retain a copy in the Sent Mail folder
option box if it is not already selected.

Do the following to determine which user is the designated Network Manager:

1. Compose an Inquiry message by clicking the Inquiry icon.

  (This procedure requires that the Inquiry message form be installed on the
  server. The Inquiry form is loaded on all Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk
  Networks servers and should be available unless it has been specifically
  removed by the Network Manager.)

2. Enter some text into the message body and click the Send button.

3. Open the Sent Mail folder and read the retained copy of the Inquiry message.

The To: field of the Inquiry message displays the customized name of the Network
Manager's mailbox.
