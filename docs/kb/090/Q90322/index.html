The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
- Microsoft Workgroup Connections, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If resource connections are persistent in Windows for Workgroups or Workgroup
Connections, connecting to and disconnecting from resource connections in
Windows for Workgroups and Workgroup Connections changes the list of persistent
connections.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Disconnecting from a network drive is permanent, and removes it from the list of
persistent connections. There is no one-time-only disconnect feature, although
you can replace a persistent connection for one session with a temporary
connection. This can only be done in Windows for Workgroups through the Connect
Network and Connect Network Printer dialog boxes.

To use a resource for one session, without disrupting the persistent connection
list, clear the selection of the Reconnect At Startup check box when connecting
to that resource.

The CONNECT.DAT file contains a list of persistent connections. When starting the
network, either from Windows Connections or Windows for Workgroups, this list is
used to keep track of the connections. These connections are established when
you either log on to the network in Windows Connections, or when Windows for
Workgroups is started.

For example, if a persistent printer resource is set in Windows for Workgroups
and is then disconnected from Windows Connections by using the NET command, the
resource will not automatically reconnect when starting Windows for Workgroups.

Novell Users
------------

You must log on to Novell before starting Windows for Workgroups for persistent
connections to be established when starting Windows for Workgroups.
