The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

It is possible to run a shared copy of Windows for Workgroups from a Novell
NetWare server as long as Novell NetWare has been added as a secondary network.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For Windows for Workgroups to run from a shared directory on the network, a
real-mode redirector must be loaded prior to starting Windows and a connection
to the shared directory must be made. Setup does NOT modify AUTOEXEC.BAT to
start the real-mode network; this modification must be made manually.

However, Setup does ensure that all of the necessary components for running the
real-mode redirector are on the local drive. Setup adds MSIPX and NETX to the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file when Novell NetWare compatibility is added.

NOTE: You must log on before starting Windows.

Using a Local Windows Directory
-------------------------------

If your personal Windows directory is on a local hard drive, the real-mode
network driver files are copied to the local Windows directory. These files
include PROTMAN.DOS, PROTOCOL.INI, MSIPX.SYS, MSIPX.COM, and NETX.COM.

Using a Windows Directory on the Network
----------------------------------------

If your personal Windows directory is on the Novell server, the real-mode network
driver files will be copied to the system startup driver root directory (usually
C:\). The files are copied there to guarantee that the files will be accessible
from the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files during system startup.

The PATH= Statement
-------------------

As with any SETUP /N configuration, your PATH= statement in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file
must contain the personal WINDOWS directory and the shared WINDOWS directory.
The personal WINDOWS directory should come first on the path. For example:

  path=c:\windows;z:\shared\windows;c:\dos

Setup adds these to the path automatically during SETUP /N, but if you change the
path or the drive letter where the directories exist, you will have to edit the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file and change the PATH= statement yourself.

The NetWare product included here is manufactured by Novell, a vendor independent
