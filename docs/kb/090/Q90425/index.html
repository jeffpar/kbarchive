The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
- Microsoft Workgroup Connections, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows for Workgroups and Workgroup Connections support Microsoft LAN
Manager Logon scripts. This feature is supported when running Windows for
Workgroups if LAN Manager has been installed as a secondary network through the
Networks option in Control Panel.

To support LAN Manager Logon scripts with Workgroup Connections, you must make
some changes to your configuration.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To enable this feature with Workgroup Connections or when starting the real-mode
redirector from Windows for Workgroups, perform the following modifications to
your configuration:

1. When starting the real-mode redirector, use the FULL redirector by issuing
  the following command when starting the network:

  net start full

2. Edit the SYSTEM.INI file, and add the following lines to the [Network]
  section

        LMLogon=Yes
        LogonDomain=&lt;Domain name&gt;

  where &lt;Domain name&gt; is the LAN Manager Domain that you have an account
  on and want to logon to at startup.

  NOTE: NET.EXE only reads the LMLogon=line with a value of YES or NO. Zero (0)
  and one (1) are not acceptable values for this setting.

The SYSTEM.INI file for Windows for Workgroups is normally in the WINDOWS
directory.

The SYSTEM.INI for Workgroup Connections is normally in the directory in which
Workgroup Connections was installed (that is, C:\DOS\NET).
