SUMMARY
=======

The Windows for Workgroups ClipBook Viewer offers the options Full Access and
Read Only when a page is shared. This article describes what these mean and when
each should be used.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although your own shared ClipBook pages are never changed by someone accessing
them through their ClipBook viewer, some ClipBook pages contain a reference to
the application that created the original page information. These pages can be
used to establish a link to that application and receive updates when the
information changes. The application that contains the original information and
provides updates is called the "server application." The application that
receives the updated information is called the "client application."

In addition to receiving information from the server application, some client
applications may provide ways to make changes to the original data. If you grant
Full Access to a share, you allow the client applications of this type to change
your data.

If you grant Read Only access to a share, clients can receive updates but cannot
change your information.

NOTE: "Editing the linked object" is not supported for network links and is not
affected by the Read Only or Full Access settings.
