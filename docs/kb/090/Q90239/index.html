The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Windows for Workgroups file sharer, VSHARE.386, contains several
improvements over the MS-DOS file sharing utility, SHARE.EXE. These improvements
allow Windows for Workgroups to share files in a manner similar to other network
operating systems.

This article defines the file sharer (NOT the file server) and its function in
the operating system.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To be able to allow multiple users or programs concurrent access to files and
resources, an operating system must provide two basic services:

- Arbitration of access requests

- Updating of in-memory information that describes resources

Under MS-DOS, these two functions are handled by a component known as the file
"sharer." This component is separate from the MS-DOS kernel. For MS-DOS versions
3.00 and later, this functionality is provided by the
terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program, SHARE.EXE. Microsoft Windows for
Workgroups version 3.1 when running in Enhanced Mode, replaces this with a new
program, VSHARE.386.

VSHARE.386 is intended as a drop-in replacement for SHARE.EXE. Because VSHARE is
an Enhanced Mode virtual device driver (VxD), it has features which improve file
sharing under Enhanced Mode. Because it was designed to work with Windows for
Workgroups, VSHARE has features to make it "friendlier" than SHARE.EXE,
especially in the area of access control. If SHARE.EXE is loaded and you start
Windows for Workgroups in Enhanced Mode, VSHARE takes over as file sharer until
you exit Windows. If you usually run Windows for Workgroups in Enhanced Mode,
you may not need to run SHARE.EXE at all (this can save 5K or more of
conventional memory).

For each file open on the local computer, MS-DOS maintains a copy of information
about the file in memory. This includes both global information that pertains to
the file on disk, such as the file's location on disk and its size, and local
information that pertains to each open instance of the file, such as the
application's file pointer. If a file is opened by multiple programs, and one
application changes a global attribute of the file, the sharer updates the
information for all file handles open on that file.

NOTE: The file handles that applications use to keep track of files point to the
copies of information about files maintained by MS-DOS in memory.

If the real mode sharer SHARE.EXE is present without VSHARE, then all information
needed to open a file must be in memory at all times, even when Enhanced Mode
virtual memory is being used. (Virtual memory cannot be swapped into or out of
memory while MS-DOS is busy with a file system request.) When you use VSHARE
instead of (or in addition to) SHARE, file open information for multiple Virtual
Machines (VMs) does not need to be in memory at the same time, only when each VM
is active. (MS-DOS applications run in separate VMs, and the Windows for
Workgroups file server runs its own separate VM.)

NOTE: This means you can use the Enhanced Mode PerVMFiles setting with VSHARE,
which means you can open more files using VSHARE than using SHARE when running
Windows for Workgroups in Enhanced Mode. See the "Microsoft Windows Resource
Kit," version 3.1, for a discussion of the PerVMFiles setting.

Unlike SHARE (which uses global conventional memory), VSHARE uses extended memory
to store its copy of open file information. This greatly increases the number of
open files that Windows for Workgroups, especially the server, can work with at
once. Applications which use file locking, such as Microsoft Mail, are less
likely to run out of file locks with VSHARE than with SHARE.

Because Windows for Workgroups is designed to function as a peer server, the
access control rules used by SHARE have been relaxed somewhat in VSHARE. SHARE
forbids the opening of "compatibility mode" files while a "sharing" file is
open, and vice versa. SHARE forbids the opening of "compatibility mode" files
from different machines or VMs. Since a large percentage of MS-DOS applications
and Windows applications still use compatibility mode, SHARE prevents the
Windows for Workgroups server from operating effectively with several clients
connected to one server (the only way SHARE could operate in this environment is
if all the files on the server had read-only attributes). This makes it
inconvenient for network administrators to set up directories of shared files on
a network file server.

Using VSHARE, a compatibility mode read request can be active from different
machines and at the same time as most sharing requests. This makes it easy to
set up a directory of shared files under Windows for Workgroups. The access
rules are only relaxed for "safe" access requests. If a process tries to open a
file to write to it, for example, the more restrictive set of rules is used.

This new file access behavior is known as "softcompat mode." There may be a
reason to disable this, if there is a conflict with an older application that
has problems with the new access rules. This can be done by placing
"SOFTCOMPATMODE=FALSE" in the [386ENH] section of the Windows SYSTEM.INI file.
There are no applications known to require this setting.

It is necessary to use a file sharer on any machine being used as a file server
or peer server. If an access violation happens on a server and "Sharing
Violation" error message appears, it interferes with server performance. This is
because MS-DOS is in a critical section while the error message pop-up is
visible. For this reason, VSHARE disables sharing violation pop-up messages on
MS-DOS versions 4.01 and greater. If this causes problems, you can add the
"ENABLESHARINGPOPUPS=TRUE" setting to the [386ENH] section of the Windows
SYSTEM.INI file. There are no applications known to require this setting.

The file sharer can also be used to control access to MS-DOS device drivers, if
these are opened using MS-DOS file system calls. With SHARE present, it is
possible to get sharing violations on the NUL and CON devices. VSHARE does not
generate sharing violation error messages when you access these devices. You can
restore SHARE device sharing functionality by adding
"TRADITIONALDEVICESHARING=TRUE" to the [386ENH] section of the Windows
SYSTEM.INI file. There are no applications known to require this setting.

Some applications are incompatible with file access checking. In general, it is
not recommended that you run such applications under Windows for Workgroups,
especially while the file server is running. You can use the SYSTEM.INI switch
"IGNORESHARINGVIOLATIONS=TRUE" to diagnose such problems that occur when VSHARE
is installed. This switch turns off file access checking for all files and
devices in the system. Use this switch to diagnose problems only; you should not
use it to correct problems. It usually causes more problems than it solves. If
any application refuses to run with SHARE or VSHARE installed, contact the
application vendor for assistance.

Sometimes problems occur where a "network aware" version of an application does
not keep application documents open. These applications attempt to arbitrate
document access by using a semaphore or marker in the document file or on disk.
This technique usually fails in a multi-user network environment due to
synchronization problems. In order to write an application properly to handle
multi- user or multi-application access to data files, the first instance of the
application accessing any data file should KEEP THE FILE OPEN to allow the file
sharer and MS-DOS to communicate to subsequent applications that the file is in
use. This suggestion applies equally to SHARE and VSHARE. There is no way that
the file sharer can know that a file is "busy" unless it is actually kept open
by the application.

Troubleshooting Tip
-------------------

If problems with file sharing are suspected, remember that the file sharer
responsible for a specific file is the sharer running on the machine where the
file is physically located. If file sharing problems occur while you access a
file on a network drive, modifying the VSHARE settings on the local machine will
not help.
