SUMMARY
=======

An advantage for pen computers would be the ability to add handwriting to a text
file. This process is known as annotation. An application that implements
full-scale annotation must address several issues, including movement, saving
ink to a file, delayed recognition, and using gestures. One of the most basic
issues is movement.

ANNOTATE demonstrates one scrolling algorithm that scrolls the ink and the text
file appropriately.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Software
Library:

  ANNOTATE.EX
  (http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/ANNOTATE.EX)

For an application to attach ink to a specified position of a text file, it must
scroll and repaint the ink in the appropriate position as the text moves. The
ANNOTATE sample application demonstrates one of many possible scrolling
algorithms. ANNOTATE also demonstrates dynamically changing ink color and
width.

ANNOTATE calls the RedisplayPenData function to redisplay the ink and the
DuplicatePenData function to save ink over the life of the application. ANNOTATE
can serve as a foundation for other pen-centric annotation applications.
