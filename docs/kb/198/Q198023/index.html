-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you use Outlook Web Access (OWA) to log on using Distributed Password
Authentication (DPA) as the authentication method you will get the following
error:

  You do not have access permissions for this URL.
  Your membership has been verified, but you do not have permissions to
  access the URL you requested. Contact the service provider that
  maintains your membership for this site.

CAUSE
=====

In Exchange Server 5.5, the support for DPA with OWA was not implemented. The
hotfix described below also changes the options page so that the change password
button is not displayed if the user is logged on using DPA.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. If you are not severely affected by this
specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.5 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information on support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Component: Outlook Web Access

  File Name      Size     Date
  --------------------------------
  Constant.inc    2,940   12/10/98
  Logon.inc       8,250   12/10/98
  Set.asp        18,960   12/10/98

The above files need to be installed in the following locations:

- Copy Constant.inc to your server's Exchsrvr\Webdata\USA folder.

- Copy Logon.inc to your server's Exchsrvr\Webdata\USA\Lib folder.

- Copy Set.asp to your server's Exchsrvr\Webdata\USA\Options folder.


Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Outlook Web Access
version 5.5.
