SUMMARY
=======

When settings are changed at the site for the Systems Management Server Remote
Control Agent, some of these changes are not automatically implemented at
existing clients in the site. In particular, the protocol, the compression type,
and the video acceleration are not changed on existing clients. Newly installed
clients will get current settings for the Remote Control Agent.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This action is by design. You can, however, force an update on clients by using
any of the following methods:

- At the client, start Control Panel and double-click the Systems Management
  icon to initiate a component reinstallation. On the Components tab, click the
  Remote Control component, and then click the Repair Installation button. When
  the agent is reinstalled on the client, it will receive the current settings.

- At the client, run the following command line:

  %WinDir%\MS\SMS\CLICOMP\REMCTRL\RCHWCFG.EXE install

  This will cause the current settings for the items listed above to be
  refreshed. This option can also be implemented using the software
  distribution capabilities of Systems Management Server.

- Use Systems Management Server Administrator to disable the remote tools
  client agent, wait for the component to be removed on the clients. (The
  client becomes active and uninstalls the agent at the next polling interval,
  every 23 hours.) Change the settings as appropriate and enable the agent so
  that the clients will reinstall that component and receive the current
  settings.
