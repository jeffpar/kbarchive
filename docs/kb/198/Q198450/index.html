SYMPTOMS
========

You may encounter a non-delivery report (NDR) similar to the following if an
Inbox Assistant is configured using the "Leave message intact" method while
forwarding.

   -----Original Message-----
   From:   System Administrator
   Sent:   Monday, August 10, 1998 11:08 AM
   To:   Mailbox1
   Subject:   Undeliverable:
  
   Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

         Subject:
         Sent:   8/10/98 11:08 AM
  
   The following recipient(s) could not be reached:
  
         Mailbox1 on 8/10/98 11:08 AM
             The message could not be delivered because you do not have
  create permissions on this folder or it is only available to folder
  owners at this time MSEXCH:MSExchangeMTA:SITENAME:SERVERNAME

CAUSE
=====

The original sender does not have permissions on the public folder which the
message is being forwarded to.

The "Leave message intact" option when forwarding a message forwards the message
as if it were a new message (without the forward prefix in the Subject box), and
it is delivered FROM the original sender NOT the mailbox which forwarded it.

The "Leave message intact" option can be selected from the Inbox Assistant when
editing or adding a new rule.

WORKAROUND
==========

Give the original sender Owner permissions on the Public folder, or change the
forwarding option to "Standard."

MORE INFORMATION
================

EXAMPLE:

1. An "Alert Service" uses the Service profile and mailbox to send messages to
  the Network Alerts Mailbox.

2. The Network Alerts Mailbox has an Inbox Assistant rule which forwards the
  message to a Public folder called Alerts Public Folder (listed in the global
  address list).

3. The Inbox rule is set up as follows:

  From                Network Alerts
  Forward to          Alerts Public Folder
  Method              Leave message intact

4. The Alerts Public Folder client permissions are set as follows:

  Default = Reviewer
  Anonymous = None
  Network alerts = Owner

Since the original sender of the message is Service, and Service does not have
permissions on the Public folder, the NDR is generated.
