IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you access shares on a computer running Windows NT Server from a Windows NT
client and the IRPstackSize parameter is set too low on the server, you may
receive the following error message:

  Not enough server storage is available to process this command.

CAUSE
=====

Depending on the hardware configuration of a specific computer, the default
value may not be large enough for the Srv service to properly administer shared
directories on some of the physical drives. You may see one or both of the
following event messages:

  Event ID: 2011  Source: Srv
  The server's configuration parameter "irpstacksize" is too small for
  the server to use a local device.  Please increase the value of this
  parameter.

  Event ID: 0
  Source SRV
  Description:  Description for Event ID 0 could not be found.  It
  contains the insertion string \device\LanManServer

You may receive one of the above error message when a Windows NT client tries to
access certain shared directories on such a server.

When a Windows for Workgroups client tries to access the same shared directories,
the following message will be generated:

  Path not found.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition or the individual software
update. For information on obtaining the latest service pack, please go to:

- http://www.microsoft.com/windows/servicepacks/

-or-

- Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack

For information on obtaining the individual software update, contact Microsoft
Product Support Services. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support
Services phone numbers and information on support costs, please go to the
following address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS


Service Pack (SP) 5 sets a minimum allowed of 7. It ignores all smaller values,
and sets a default of 7 if none is specified.

SP6 sets a minimum allowed of 7. It ignores all smaller values and sets a default
of 11 if none is specified.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, modify the registry by using the following
information.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

The registry value IRPstackSize, which may be listed at

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanServer
  \Parameters

defaults to 0x4 if the value is not explicitly present. Valid values range from
0x1 to 0xC (1 to 12).

To increase the value of the parameter when it is not already present, go to the
key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
  \LanmanServer\Parameters

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.
For the IRPStackSize change to take effect, the Server has to be rebooted.

The value of IRPStackSize defaults to 0x4 if it is not explicitly present. If the
key is not present, click Add Value in Registry Editor. The Value Name should be
IRPStackSize and the Data Type is REG_DWORD.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
