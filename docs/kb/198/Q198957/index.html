SUMMARY
=======

This article includes all available information, as well as any new updates, to
the Migration Wizard as of the release of Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Command-Line Options for the Migration Wizard:

You can use the Migration Wizard or a combination of command-line options and a
control file to perform migration. The command-line options are as follows.

/C:&lt;control file&gt; Specifies the path and file name of the control file.

/A:&lt;account name&gt; The administrator account name for either a Microsoft
Mail (PC) or Novell GroupWise postoffice. Not needed for migration file import,
Lotus cc:Mail, or Collabra Share migration.

/P:&lt;password&gt; The password for the administrator account on the Microsoft
Mail (PC) or Lotus cc:Mail Postoffice, or the password for the Novell GroupWise
migration ID. Not needed for migration file import.

/S Silent mode. No error dialog boxes are displayed. All errors are written to
the Windows NT Application Event log.

/? Displays the Help text files.

NOTE: If you are using the Migration Wizard in batch mode, the code page of the
control file and the account file must be the Windows Default code page. Use the
code page for the language you are migrating.

For example:

  mailmig /C:d:\migrate\po72195.txt
  mailmig /C:Salespo.txt /A:Admin /P:Katmandu

When run in a batch mode, mailmig returns result codes depending on the success
of the processing:

- 0=success: no errors or warnings

- 1=warnings, no errors

- 2=errors, possible warnings

  Existing Service Pack Documentation

Control File Keywords:

The control file is a text file that includes the options listed below. Each
option is followed by a brief description.

Mode The mode for this migration. Valid options are FILE, MSMAILPC, CCMAIL,
COLLABRA, NOTES, GRPWISE, GRPWISE5, ADSI(for LDAP), and IMAP. If included, it
must be the first line in the control file. (Required)

Function The migration function to perform. Valid options are FULL, EXTRACT, and
IMPORT. FULL means to perform a full migration (extract and import). EXTRACT
means to extract a user list file (MS Mail PC) or to extract migration files
(Lotus cc:Mail, Lotus Notes, Novell GroupWise, Novell GroupWise 5.x, LDAP, IMAP,
and Collabra Share). IMPORT means to perform an MS Mail (PC) import from a user
list file or to import migration files created by one of the other extractors.
Defaults to FULL. Note that this is ignored unless Mode option is set to
MSMAILPC, CCMAIL, NOTES, COLLABRA, GRPWISE, GRPWISE5, IMAP or LDAP. (Optional)

File (Required when Mode option is set to FILE, or Function option is set to
EXTRACT or IMPORT, or the Mode option is set to CCMAIL, NOTES, COLLABRA,
GRPWISE, GRPWISE5, ADSI, or IMAP.) Specify the path and file name of the packing
list or userlist file, or for CCMAIL, NOTES, COLLABRA, ADSI, IMAP, GRPWISE or
GRPWISE5, specify the path to the temporary directory for migration files.

Accounts (Optional and used when Mode is set to CCMAIL, NOTES, GRPWISE, MSMAILPC,
GRPWISE5 or ADSI. Required when Mode is set to IMAP.) A userlist file with a
listing of accounts to be migrated. If not specified, it defaults to all
accounts in the postoffice or container (for LDAP). The format of the names in
the accounts file must match the name format as it appears in the Migration
Wizard account selection dialog box. Each name is on one line, followed by a
carriage return and line feed. For IMAP, check the format of the userlist file
with the Ldapimap.rtf documentation.

Mailbox (Optional.) Whether to extract mailbox creation information and create
the mailbox on Microsoft Exchange Server. If this is set to TRUE, mailboxes are
created and messages are imported. If this is set to FALSE, messages are
imported to existing mailboxes or mailboxes that are converted from custom
recipients. Valid options are TRUE and FALSE. Defaults to TRUE.

GWDomain The path to the GroupWise 5.x domain. Valid options are either a UNC
path or a mapped drive location. (Applicable and required only when MODE is
GRPWISE5).

POName The name of the GroupWise 5.x Post Office to migrate or extract.
(Applicable and required only when MODE is GRPWISE5).

Postoffice (Required when Mode is MSMAILPC, CCMAIL, NOTES, COLLABRA, GRPWISE or
ADSI). This specifies the full path to the container, including server name. In
general the format can be:

  M:\GRPWISE\PostOf LDAP_SERVER/OU=Recipients,O=MICROSOFT

Secure (Optional; ignored unless Mode option is set to ADSI or IMAP). Valid
options are TRUE and FALSE. Defaults to FALSE.

Encrypted (Optional; ignored unless Mode option is set to ADSI or IMAP). Valid
options are TRUE and FALSE. Defaults to FALSE.

Port (Optional; ignored unless Mode option is set to ADSI). The port number for
LDAP access may differ for each LDAP directory. The default port is 389.

Email Whether to extract personal e-mail messages. Valid options are TRUE and
FALSE. Defaults to TRUE. (Optional; ignored unless Mode option is set to
MSMAILPC, CCMAIL, NOTES, GRPWISE, GRPWISE5, or IMAP.)

Public (Optional; ignored unless Mode option is set to MSMAILPC, CCMAIL, or
COLLABRA.) This is used to determine whether to extract shared folders, bulletin
board or forum information. Valid options are TRUE and FALSE. Defaults to TRUE.
Can not be used when MODE is GRPWISE5.

PAB (Optional, ignored unless Mode option is set to MSMAILPC) Whether to extract
personal address book (PAB) entries and PAB distribution lists. Valid options
are TRUE and FALSE. Defaults to TRUE. Can not be used when MODE is GRPWISE5.

Schedule (Optional; ignored unless Mode option is set to MSMAILPC, NOTES,
GRPWISE, or GRPWISE5.) Whether to extract schedule information. Valid options
are TRUE and FALSE. Defaults to TRUE.

EmailStart (Optional; ignored unless Mode option is set to MSMAILPC, NOTES,
CCMAIL, GRPWISE, GRPWISE5, or IMAP.) The earliest (start) date for filtering
which e-mail messages are moved. It is in the date/time format (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS).
Defaults to Jan 01, 1601. Messages without dates are always migrated.

EmailEnd (Optional; ignored unless Mode option is set to MSMAILPC, NOTES, CCMAIL,
GRPWISE, GRPWISE5, or IMAP.) The end date for filtering which e-mail messages
are moved. It is in the date/time format (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS). Messages without
dates are always migrated. Defaults to the current date.

Home-Server (Required when Mailbox option is set to TRUE.) The Microsoft Exchange
Server computer where information is to be migrated. Defaults to the server that
was used last or the current machine name.

Container (Optional; ignored unless Mailbox option is set to TRUE.) The container
and path on the specified home server where new mailboxes are to be migrated.
The path is formatted as follows:

  Recipients/cn=users/cn=accnting

where users is a subcontainer of Recipients and accnting is a subcontainer of
users. Defaults to the Recipients container. The directory name is visible on
the property page of the Recipients container and can be different from the
display name. For example, the display name of the default Recipients container
on a French Microsoft Exchange Server computer is "Destinataires," but the
directory name is "Recipients."

Template (Optional; ignored unless Mailbox option is set to TRUE or mailboxes are
created.) The Microsoft Exchange Server alias for the template mailbox to be
used in creating new mailboxes. If the template mailbox is in a different
Recipients container from the new mailbox, the template must be specified with
the full distinguished name. Defaults to null. To find the distinguished name of
a mailbox, you can use Directory Export and set the header line of the export
file to: obj-class,common-name,obj-dist-name.

NTAccounts (Optional; ignored unless Mailbox option is set to TRUE.) Whether to
create Windows NT accounts for new users and which value to use as the Windows
NT account password. Valid options are RANDOM, ALIAS, and NO. RANDOM creates
Windows NT accounts and generate random passwords. ALIAS creates Windows NT
accounts and uses the Microsoft Exchange Server e-mail alias as the initial
password. NO does not create Windows NT accounts. Defaults to NO.

NTDomain (Optional; ignored unless Mailbox option is set to TRUE.) The Windows NT
domain where new Windows NT accounts are to be created. Defaults to the domain
that the user running migration is logged on to.

NOTES, GRPWISE, GRPWISE5, IMAP, or FILE.) Specifies the destination store for
migrated data. Valid options are SERVER and PST. SERVER migrates information to
the Microsoft Exchange Server information store. PST migrates information to
personal folder (.PST) files and personal address books (.PAB). Default is
SERVER.

PSTPath (Ignored unless ImportDestination is set to PST.) The fully qualified
path to the directory where personal folder (.PST) and personal address book
(.PAB) files will be created.

GWUserGRPName (Required if MODE is set to GRPWISE, otherwise ignored by
everything else.) The name of the Novell GroupWise group whose members are to be
migrated. This can not be used when MODE is GRPWISE5.
