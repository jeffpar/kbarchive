The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Exchange InterOrg Public Folder Replication Tool
(Exssrv.exe), a folder that is deleted at the subscriber side may not be
replicated again.

CAUSE
=====

To facilitate deletions that may not have been fully replicated, Exchange Server
keeps track of folder IDs of deleted folders and does not allow that folder to
be recreated. This is called a tombstone.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. Create a new folder on the publisher side.

2. Copy all data from the original folder to the new folder.

3. Delete the original folder.

4. Begin replication of new folder to the subscriber.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The name of the new folder may be identical to that of the old folder, but and
links or Favorites that are in use still point to the old folder and must be
updated.
