CD-ROM: Contains Questions Not Covered In The Book
--------------------------------------------------

The electronic assessment for Exam 70-067 that is included on the CD-ROM contains
some questions that are not included in the Readiness Review textbook.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post more information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base when it becomes available.


CD-ROM: Answer To Question 70-067mp.02.02.008 Is C Not B
--------------------------------------------------------

The answer to question 70-067mp.02.02.008 on the CD-ROM is incorrect. The correct
answer is:

"C: The required result but none of the optional results."


CD-ROM: Answer To Question 70-067mp.02.05.002 Is B Not A
--------------------------------------------------------

Question 70-067mp.02.05.002 is found in both the book and CD-ROM. The answer
contained in the book is correct: "B. The required result and one optional
result." However, the CD-ROM incorrectly lists answer A as the correct answer.


CD-ROM: Answer To Question 70-067mp.04.01.004 Is D Not C
--------------------------------------------------------

The answer to question 70-067mp.04.01.004, which appears only on the CD-ROM, is
incorrect. The correct answer is: "D. The proposed solution does not provide the
required result."


Page 16: Correct Answer Is D
----------------------------

Page 16:
Question 70-067.01.02.003, correct answer is D, as the minimum number of disks
required to implement Raid 5 (disk striping with parity) is 3 disks.

Change answer C to read:
C. Incorrect. You are installing an HCL-approved Windows NT Server on an Intel,
Pentium-based computer with two identically sized hard disks. The required
result, to provide fault tolerance to programs and data, is not achieved through
the implementation of a RAID 5 (disk striping with parity) disk configuration as
the minimum number of disks required to implement RAID 5 is 3 disks. The first
optional result...

Change answer D to read:
D. Correct. The required result is not achieved. The minimum number of disks
required to implement RAID 5 (disk striping with parity) is 3 disks.


Page 52: Answer A's Explanation Should Read "first" Rather Than "second"
------------------------------------------------------------------------

On page 52, change:

"A. Incorrect: While the required result is achieved, only the second optional
result is achieved."

To:
"A. Incorrect: While the required result is achieved, only the first optional
result is achieved."


Page 52: Correction To Answer B's Explanation
---------------------------------------------

On page 52, Answer B, the last sentence of the explanation,

Change:
"When this command is launched, the installatioin routine will ask that you
insert setup boot floppies to complete the installation."

To:
"When this command is launched, the installation routine will ask that you insert
blank floppy disks to create setup boot disks to continue the installation."


Page 66: Explanation Correction For Question 70-067.02.02.008
-------------------------------------------------------------

Page 65, explanation for option C, third paragraph, last sentence:

Change:
"Therefore, only the required result and the first optional result are
achieved."

To:
"Therefore, only the required result is achieved."


Page 231: Answer Option C For Question 70-067.04.01.002 Is Incorrect
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Page 231, question 70-067.04.01.003, answer C:

Change:
"NetWare user account for each user that will access the NetWare server through
the gateway."

To:
"NetWare user account for the NT Server."


Page 235: A System Running Windows NT And RAS Cannot Support A SLIP Client
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Page 235, fifth paragraph, second sentence:

Change:
"A system running Windows NT Server and RAS can support PPP clients, PPTP
clients, and SLIP clients if properly configured."

To:
"A system running Windows NT Server and RAS can support PPP clients and PPTP
clients if properly configured."

SLIP is not supported on Windows NT Server RAS. A RAS client, however, can
connect to a third-party SLIP server.


Pages 273 &amp; 274: Question 70-067.06.01.001 Clarification
--------------------------------------------------------

Pages 273 &amp; 274:

Change question 70-067.06.01.001 from:
"You install a new video card in a Pentium-based computer running Windows NT
Server. After restarting the server, the screen remains black. Subsequent
restarts have the same result."

To:
"You install a new video card in a Pentium-based computer running Windows NT
Server. After restarting the server, you get a black screen instead of the logon
message. Subsequent restarts have the same result."
