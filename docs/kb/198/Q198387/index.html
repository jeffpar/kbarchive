-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

While working with Control Panel or Display properties, you may receive the
following error if using the Chips &amp; Technologies video driver in
conjunction with a Toshiba TECRA laptop.

  An error occurred while Windows was working with the Control Panel file
  C:\winnt\system32.cpl.

CAUSE
=====

This error can be attributed to an improper setting in the Windows registry or a
corrupted key in the registry.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion
     \ControlsFolder\Display\shellex\PropertySheetHandlers\ChipsDSP

  NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. Delete the ChipsDSP key from the above path.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

  NOTE: After restarting the computer, the video display will be set in VGA.

5. Reinstall the Chips &amp; Technologies video driver and configure the
  resolution properties.

Note: The reapplication of any Windows NT service pack may disable the Chips
&amp; Technologies video driver, causing for the driver to be reinstalled.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0.
