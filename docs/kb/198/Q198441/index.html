SUMMARY
=======

It may be necessary at times to determine who created an appointment in a
calendar in which the appointment organizer has Author permissions.

To determine who created the appointment, you must change the default view of the
calendar to a table format, and add the Organizer field.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To change the default view of the calendar, and add the Organizer field follow
these steps:

1. In Outlook 97, open the calendar by clicking File, pointing to Open Special
  Folders, and clicking Exchange Server Folder. In Outlook 98, on the File
  menu, point to Open, and click Other Users Folder.

2. Type the name of the Calendar Mailbox and select Calendar as the Folder
  option.

3. To change the view of the Calendar, on the View menu, point to Current View,
  and click Active Appointments.

  NOTE: The default view for a calendar is Day/Week/Month.

4. Add the Organizer field to the Active Appointments view.

  In Outlook 97:

  a. On the View menu, click Show Fields.

  b. In the Select Fields From drop-down box, select All Appointment Fields,
     and the Organizer field will be available in the Available Fields dialog
     box.

  In Outlook 98:

  a. On the View menu, point to Current View, click Customize Current View,
     then click Fields.

  b. Select the Organizer field (listed alphabetically), then click Add to add
     it to the "Show These Fields In This Order" dialog box. Click OK, click OK
     again, and then click Close.

The Current View will now display the Organizer field, which is populated by the
Name of the mailbox of the user who created the appointment.

Views are personal settings in Outlook and will not modify the actual view of the
Calendar you are viewing.

If you modify a default view then attempt to change to another view, you may be
prompted with a Save View Settings dialog box.

  Discard the current view settings....
  This option signifies that a change was made to the view. Do you want
  to discard it?

  Save the current view settings...
  This option signifies that a change was made to the current view. Do
  you want to save it to another name?

  Update the view "Name of View" with the current view settings...
  This option signifies that a change was made to the current view. Do
  you want to save the settings in the default view name?
