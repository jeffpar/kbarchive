-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

WMI will go into an infinite loop when an attempt is made to connect to an HP-UX
9.x system running DCE. The customer will be unaware of this loop except that
WMI will hang, and that there is constant network traffic between the systems
until the Windows NT system is restarted.

CAUSE
=====

The implementation of RPC used in HP-UX 9.x does not handle connections
correctly. In the endless loop case, the remote server returns
NCA_STATUS_UNK_IF(0x1C010003). HP-UX 9.x's RPC implementation is incorrect.
Specifically they are not byte-swapping the TimeHiAndVersion field of the
Activity UUID. Because of this, MSRPC does not recognize the datagram reject
packet. This has been resolved in HP-UX 10.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. If you are not severely affected by this
specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Windows NT
service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information on support costs, please go to the following
