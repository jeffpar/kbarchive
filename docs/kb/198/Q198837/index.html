- Microsoft Windows 98 
- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Connection Manager profiles no longer work properly after you upgrade from
Windows 95 to Windows 98 in DOS mode or from a previous version of DOS.

CAUSE
=====

DOS does not understand long file names. The Windows 98 upgrade determines that
the c:\progra~1\connec~1 directory where Connection Manager is located is
actually the Internet Connection Wizard included with Windows 98. The upgrade
process incorrectly modifies several files and directory locations in the
registry. The previously configured connectoid will no longer work and may be
removed from the Desktop.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

- When you upgrade from Windows 95 to Windows 98, upgrade from Windows instead
  of a DOS prompt or previous version of DOS.

-OR-

- If you must upgrade from DOS, you will need to reinstall the Connection
  Manager connectiod that you created in Connection Manager Administration Kit
  (CMAK). In most cases you can simply re-run the *.exe file you created. If
  you no longer have the executable file, you may need to contact your
  Corporate IT department or ISP who created the file. If you created the
  profile from the IIS 4.0 CMAK, you will need to rebuild the profile by
  running the CMAK Wizard.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows 98.
