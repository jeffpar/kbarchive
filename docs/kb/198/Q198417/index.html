  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

After the mini-wizard has run on a system that was prepared for duplication by
using the System Preparation Tool (Sysprep), the following message is
displayed:

  At least one service failed to start.

On closer inspection of the event viewer, the following event is posted:

  Event ID: 7000 Source: Service Control Manager Description: "The
  Psysdup2 service failed to start due to the following error: The system
  cannot find the file specified"

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because one of the System Preparation tools is missing from
the folder from which Sysprep.exe was run. When Sysprep is run, this file gets
copied over to the %SystemRoot%\System32 subfolder and gets added to the list of
services.

If the file does not exist in the source folder from which Sysprep was run, the
service entry in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet will still be added
for Psysdup2.exe to start but will fail to start.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this problem, re-expand the System Preparation tools from the source
compact disc to the directory and make sure the Psysdup2.exe file exists. Then,
rerun Sysprep.exe on the master system.

Psysdup2.exe is used after the user first logon request to change the Product ID
of Office 97.

If Office 97 is not being used on the target systems and hard disks have already
been duplicated, you can disable the service on each system by doing the
following:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and locate the following registry
  subkey:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \system\currentControlSet\Services\Psysdup2

2. Double click the "Start: REG_DWORD: 0x2" value, which will bring up the
  "DWORD Editor" dialog box.

3. Change the value from 2 to 4, and then click OK; this disables the service.

4. Close Regedt32.exe and restart the system
