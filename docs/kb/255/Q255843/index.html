The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use Outlook to log on to an Exchange Server computer, you may
receive one of the following error messages:

  The name could not be resolved. The Microsoft Exchange address book was
  unable to logon to the Microsoft Exchange Server computer.

  -or-

  Outlook could not logon.

  -or-

  Your logon information is incorrect.

There is no loss of connectivity from the computer that is running Windows 2000
or Windows XP. Remote procedure call (RPC) connectivity works, you can open a
shared list on the Exchange Server computer, you can log on to the Microsoft
Windows NT Server 4.0 domain, and you can ping by name and by Internet Protocol
(IP).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, remove and re-add Transmission Control
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) in the Local Area Connection properties:

1. Double-click the My Computer icon, double-click Control Panel, and then
  double-click "Network and Dial-Up Connections".

2. Click Local Area Connection, click Properties on the File menu, and then
  click to clear the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) check box.

3. Install another protocol (NWlink or NetBEUI) to maintain a placeholder for
  each connection.

4. Restart your computer, double-click the My Computer icon, double-click
  Control Panel, and then double-click "Network and Dial-Up Connections".

5. Click Local Area Connection, click Properties on the File menu, and then
  click to select the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) check box to add TCP/IP.
