Downloading and Installing Microsoft Outlook 8.2.1 for Macintosh
---------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have version 8.1 or earlier of Outlook on your computer, if
you have a 68K-based Macintosh, or if you have no version of Outlook
installed:

1. Download the file "Mac-Outlook-8.2.1.hqx" or the file
  "Mac-Outlook-8.2.1.bin".
  (If you don't know which file to choose, download the file
  "Mac-Outlook-8.2.1.hqx".)

2. Use a utility to decode and unstuff the downloaded file as
  necessary.  You might need to download Aladdin StuffIt Expander
  version 5.0 or later to decompress this file.  This free download
  can be found at http://www.aladdinsys.com/expander/index.html.

3. Open the folder "Microsoft Outlook 8.2.1" that was created on the
  desktop.

4. Double-click "Microsoft Outlook Setup" to begin the installation.

If you have version 8.2 installed and you have a PowerPC-based
Macintosh, you can just download the 8.2 to 8.2.1 updater:

1. Download the file "Outlook-8.2.1-Updater-PPC.bin".

2. Use a utility to decode and unstuff the downloaded file as
  necessary.  You might need to download Aladdin StuffIt Expander
  version 5.0 or later to decompress this file.  This free download
  can be found at http://www.aladdinsys.com/expander/index.html.

3. Double-click "Microsoft Outlook 8.2.1 Update" to begin the update.
  This program will search for an installed version of Outlook 8.2
  on your computer to update.  The only file that will be changed is
  the file "Microsoft Outlook" or "Microsoft Outlook(E-mail only)",
  depending on the version of Outlook 8.2 you installed.

4. After the updater is finished, the version of Outlook on your
  computer will be 8.2.1.  No reboot is necessary.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
System Requirements
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Minimum: Apple Macintosh with a 68030 or faster processor, System
7.5.5 or later and at least 16 megabytes (MB) of RAM.

Recommended: Apple Power Macintosh with Mac OS 8.0 or later and at
least 16 MB of RAM. In addition, Outlook will run faster if virtual
memory is enabled and set to a minimum of 1 MB above the installed
physical memory.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Issues Fixed in Version 8.2.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------
The following issues were fixed in version 8.2.1:

*  Messages with a blank subject could not be dragged from Outlook to
  the desktop.  Instead, the following error message appeared: "The
  drag and drop operation could not be completed. An error occurred
  while writing to the disk. The disk might be full or
  write-protected.?

*  On a computer without security enabled, messages occasionally
  would not send the first time.  Instead, the ?Send? toolbar button
  remained in the depressed state.

*  When copying or cutting text that contained an URL and then
  closing the message, a message always appeared asking you if you
  would like to keep the large amount of text on the clipboard.

*  Holding down the CTRL key while double-clicking a hyperlink in a
  mail message multiple times caused Outlook to freeze.

*  Sometimes Outlook launched the web browser to display the target
  of a hyperlink in a message, even if that hyperlink was not
  directly clicked on.

*  Japanese characters received over the Internet were sometimes
  displayed incorrectly using the Japanese version of Outlook.

*  Messages with multiple attachments forwarded from an Outlook Web
  Access client to Outlook 8.2 displayed only the first attachment.

*  Web Forms were not being rendered in Outlook Web Access, even
  if the Web Services information was correctly entered.

*  Outlook was unable to use Web Services with an SSL-secured
  (https://) web server.

*  On a 68K-based Macintosh, dragging attachments from a message
  into an Exchange folder sometimes caused a Type 2 error.
