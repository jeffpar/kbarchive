SYMPTOMS
========


An application, such as ASP in Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0, that uses
COM+ to manage a thread pool may experience poor performance because COM+ does
not increase the thread count in the pool. Under normal conditions, COM+
increases the threads in the thread pool up to the maximum thread limit set by
the SetMaxThreads method for the package. However, if the initial worker threads
in the pool are too busy, then this issue may occur.

For example, when the ASP work load on an IIS 5.0 computer increases so that each
worker thread uses up a considerable amount of time to complete each request,
COM+ may never create any more threads even though the work in the shared queue
is always increasing, which in this case, causes ASP queuing to occur. This
problem can be identified by monitoring CPU usage. This problem will show up
when CPU utilization by Inetinfo is very low, usually on long blocking calls.

CAUSE
=====

Under heavy load, it is possible that the thread pool monitoring thread is not
spin up. When this happens, additional threads are not added as needed. The
thread pool monitoring thread must always be active.
