The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft has released various hotfixes to correct specific issues for Systems
Management Server (SMS) version 2.0-based clients. Microsoft has packaged these
hotfixes into a single client hotfix bundle to simplify the application of these
hotfixes to an SMS 2.0 site the is running Service Pack 1 (SP1) and
International Client Pack 4 (ICP4). This article will be updated as new hotfixes
are added to this client bundle.

The following table lists article Q numbers and titles that document corrected
problems that are included in the Client Hotfix Bundle for SMS 2.0 SP1 with ICP4
(ICP4: English, French, German, Spanish, Swedish, Dutch, Italian, Norwegian,
Danish, Finnish, Portuguese (Brazil), Portuguese (Portugal), Czech, Greek,
Hungarian, Polish, Russian, and Turkish). For more information about each
corrected problem in SMS 2.0 SP1, use the article Q number to query for the
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

IMPORTANT: You must apply ICP4 SP1 for Systems Management Server 2.0 before you
install this client bundle. Do not install the client bundle on sites that are
not upgraded to SP1 or that do not have ICP4 installed.

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that
contains the above files may also contain additional files.



NOTE: When you apply this client hotfix bundle, you may need to temporarily
disable Logon Discovery and Installation to prevent a possible client file
mismatch in a single domain-multiple site hierarchy. This can result in the
existing senior site designation being lost. For additional information about
special preparations before you apply this hotfix, click the article numbers
below to view the articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q238780 SMS: Best Practices for Applying Systems Management Server 2.0 SP1

  Q235726 SMS: Specifying Senior Site for WinNT Logon Point Management

Client Hotfix Bundle Installation
---------------------------------

Method 1: Use the Hotfix Installer:

NOTE: You can use this method only for Intel-based computers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a local subfolder on your site server or
  to a share on your network. The I386 and Alpha subfolders are required and
  must also be downloaded from the Microsoft FTP site. It is important to keep
  the folder structure intact. The Q255641.exe file is a Microsoft Windows
  Installer file that updates specific files on your site server.

2. Log on to your site server by using an account with administrative
  privileges.

3. On the site server, quit the Systems Management Server Administrator console.

4. Run the Q255641.exe file and follow the directions in the wizard. You can run
  this file in Quiet mode by using the /s switch.

5. The SMS services are stopped and restarted as part of the installation
  process. You need to stop the SMS_SITE_COMPONENT_MANAGER and SMS_EXECUTIVE
  services again before you continue to the next step.

6. From the SMS site database server, use a Microsoft SQL Server query tool (for
  example, Query Analyzer or ISQL/W) to open the 54831.sql script file. This
  file is located in the I386 subfolder you created in step 1. This script is
  also documented in the Q255641q.txt file, which is created in the
  &lt;drive&gt;\Sms\Logs folder during the installation process.

7. Select the SMS database from within the SQL Server query tool and run the
  script. If you use a common SQL Server computer for multiple site databases,
  apply this script to the site database that belongs to the primary site you
  are updating.

8. Restart the SMS site services. The new files are replicated to all logon
  points and client access points (CAPs). After all logon points and CAPs are
  updated, allow an additional 23 hours for clients to begin their update
  polling cycle.

9. WARNING: Editing the Compver.ini file incorrectly can cause serious problems
  that may orphan your clients or cause them to become out of synchronization
  with the site. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the
  incorrect use of the following step can be resolved. Use this step only if
  you have the specific component version problem described below.

  Only continue with this step after all clients are installed. This step is
  necessary only if the early revision of the hotfix for Q240921 (bug 54323)
  was previously applied and your SMS Client Base Component version is in the
  2000 range (for example, 2.00.1380.20&lt;xx&gt;). Manually reset the
  component version in the Compver.ini file located in the
  &lt;drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base folder. Change the component
  version from 2.00.1380.2004 to 2.00.1380.1072).

Method 2: Manual Installation:

NOTE: You can use this method for both Intel-based and Alpha-based site servers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a local subfolder on your site server or
  to a share on your network. The I386 and Alpha subfolders are required and
  must also be downloaded from the Microsoft FTP site. It is important to keep
  the folder structure intact. The Q255641.exe file is a Microsoft Windows
  Installer file that updates specific files on your site server and can only
  be run on Intel-based machines. Please refer to installation Method 1 in this
  article for information about how to use the Q255641.exe file.

2. Quit the SMS Administrator console and stop all SMS services from within
  Control Panel. If the SMS_SITE_BACKUP service is running, stop that as well.

3. Copy the following files from the hotfix I386 folder into the
  &lt;drive&gt;\Sms\Bin\I386 folder:

  Abnwcli.dll
  Bindcli9.dll
  Bindclin.dll
  Bindsvrn.dll
  Ccim32.dll
  Clisvcl.exe
  Falclin.dll
  Mslmcli9.dll
  Mslmclin.dll
  Mslmsvrn.dll
  Ndscli9.dll
  Ndsclin.dll
  Ndssvrn.dll
  Odpusr32.exe
  Odpsys32.exe
  Sinv32.exe
  Smsapm32.exe

4. If Alpha-based support is enabled on the primary site, copy the following
  files from the hotfix Alpha folder into the &lt;drive&gt;\Sms\Bin\Alpha
  folder:

  Abnwcli.dll
  Ccim32.dll
  Clisvcl.exe
  Falclin.dll
  Mslmclin.dll
  Mslmsvrn.dll
  Odpusr32.exe
  Odpsys32.exe
  Sinv32.exe
  Smsapm32.exe

5. Copy the following files from the appropriate &lt;platform&gt; subfolder into
  the &lt;drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base\&lt;platform&gt; folder:

  Ccmcore.exe
  Clicore.exe

6. Copy the Apasetup.exe file from the appropriate &lt;platform&gt; subfolder
  into the &lt;drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Smsapm32\&lt;platform&gt;
  folder.

7. Copy the following files from the appropriate &lt;platform&gt; subfolder into
  the &lt;drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Hinv\&lt;platform&gt; folder:

  Inhinv32.exe
  Sms_def.mof

8. Copy the Insinv32.exe file from the appropriate &lt;platform&gt; subfolder
  into the &lt;drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Sinv\&lt;platform&gt; folder.

9. Copy the Swdist32.exe file from the appropriate &lt;platform&gt; subfolder
  into the &lt;drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Swdist\&lt;platform&gt;
  folder.

10. Copy the Wbemsdk.exe file from the appropriate &lt;platform&gt; subfolder
  into the &lt;drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Wbem\&lt;platform&gt; folder.

11. WARNING: Editing the Compver.ini file incorrectly can cause serious problems
  that may orphan your clients or cause them to become out of synchronization
  with the site. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the
  incorrect use of the following step can be resolved. Use this step only if
  you have the specific component version problem described below.

  If your current SMS Client Base Component version is in the 1700 range (for
  example, 2.00.1380.17&lt;xx&gt;), replace the Compver.ini file in the
  &lt;drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base folder with the Compver1701.ini
  file that is located in the hotfix bundle source folder after renaming this
  file to Compver.ini.

12. If your current SMS Client Base Component version is in the 2000 range (for
  example, 2.00.1380.20&lt;xx&gt;), replace the Compver.ini file in the
  &lt;drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base folder with the Compver2.ini file
  located in the hotfix bundle source folder. Note that you must rename the
  Compver2.ini file to Compver.ini.

13. Replace the Compver.ini file in the
  &lt;drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Smsapm32 folder with the
  Compver1110.ini file that is located in the hotfix bundle source folder
  after you rename this file to Compver.ini.

14. Replace the Compver.ini file in the
  &lt;drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Hinv folder with the Compver1054.ini
  file that is located in the hotfix bundle source folder after you rename
  this file to Compver.ini.

15. Replace the Compver.ini file in the
  &lt;drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Sinv folder with the Compver1070.ini
  file that is located in the hotfix bundle source folder after you rename
  this file to Compver.ini.

16. Replace the Compver.ini file in the
  &lt;drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\swdist folder with the Compver1701.ini
  file that is located in the hotfix bundle source folder after you rename
  this file to Compver.ini.

17. From the SMS site database server, use a SQL Server query tool (for example,
  Query Analyzer or ISQL/W) to open the 54831.sql script file. This file is
  located in the appropriate &lt;platform&gt; folder within the hotfix
  subfolder you created in step 1.

18. Select the SMS database from within the SQL Server query tool and run the
  script. If you are using a common SQL Server computer for multiple site
  databases, apply this script to the site database that belongs to the
  primary site you are updating.

19. Restart the SMS Site services. The new files are replicated to all logon
  points and CAPs. After all logon points and CAPs are updated, allow an
  additional 23 hours for clients to begin their update polling cycle.

20. Only continue with this step after all clients are installed. This step is
  necessary only if the early revision of the hotfix for Q240921 (bug 54323)
  was previously applied and your SMS Client Base Component version is in the
  2000 range (for example, 2.00.1380.20&lt;xx&gt;). Manually reset the
  component version in the Compver.ini file located in the
  &lt;drive&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base folder. Change the component
  version from 2.00.1380.2004 to 2.00.1380.1072).
