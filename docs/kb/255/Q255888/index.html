- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.2a, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to migrate more than one user from a Microsoft Mail (MS Mail)
postoffice to an Exchange Server 5.0 or 5.5 computer, the e-mail messages may
not be migrated and the following event ID 7044 error message may be logged in
the Application event log:

  Event ID: 7044
  Source: MSExchangeMig
  Type: Error
  Category: None
  Description: Internal failure communicating with MAPI Spooler. Account %1.
  Return code 80004005.

The user accounts and mailboxes are created in Exchange Server, but the e-mail
itself is not migrated. If you migrate one user at a time, migration works.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if you are logged on as a user that has Service Account
Administrator permissions in Exchange Server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, log on as a user that has the Permissions Administrator
role selected in Exchange Server at the organization, site, and configuration
levels to perform a migration of more than one user at a time.

If a user with these permissions does not exist, either use an existing Microsoft
Windows NT account or create a new Windows NT account and add the correct
permissions:

1. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, click the Organization object,
  and then click the Permissions tab.

2. Click Add, and then add the user to the Windows NT accounts with permissions.

3. Click the user, and then click Permissions Admin in the Roles list.

4. Perform the preceding steps for the Site and Configuration objects.

If you log on as a user that has the Permissions Administrator role selected at
the organization, site, and configuration levels, you can migrate multiple users
from MS Mail to Exchange Server at one time.
