SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to forward e-mail messages from an Exchange Server
mailbox to a Post Office Protocol (POP3) address by using the Exchange
Administrator program. As an administrator, you can forward messages from a
particular mailbox to a POP3 mail account (or another type of mail account) by
using the custom recipient option.

This article also describes how to hide the custom recipient from the global
address list.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To forward mail from an Exchange mailbox to a hidden custom recipient:

1. Create a custom recipient that maps to the user's alias on the foreign mail
  server. For example, create a custom recipient with a Simple Mail Transfer
  Protocol (SMTP) address in the following format:

  &lt;Name&gt;@microsoft.com

2. In the properties of the native Exchange Server recipient mailbox, click the
  Modify button in the Alternate Recipients section on the Delivery Options
  tab.

3. Click the custom recipient that you created in step 1, and then click OK. You
  can also click to select the "Deliver messages to both recipient and
  Alternate recipient" check box.

4. To hide the custom recipient from the global address list, select the custom
  recipient in the Exchange Administrator program, open the custom recipient's
  properties, click to select the "Hide from address book" check box, and then
  click OK.

5. If you have more than one e-mail address you want to have e-mails forwarded
  to; you need to create a Distribution List (DL) in Exchange 5.5, or a Global
  Distribution Group in Exchange 2000, and then add all of the e-mail addresses
  you want e-mail forwarded to, to the new DL or Group.

When you hide the custom recipient from the global address list, the custom
recipient does not appear and cannot be selected in the global address list. Any
mail sent to the Exchange Server mailbox is copied and forwarded to the
alternate recipient (the user's POP3 mailbox).

Additionally, when you hide the custom recipient from the global address list,
the user can change their POP3 account without requiring Microsoft Outlook users
to update their Contact information. To do this, modify the e-mail address that
is assigned to the custom recipient.
