IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Microsoft Windows 95-based client connects to a Microsoft Windows NT
4.0-based remote access server and uses a server-assigned Internet Protocol (IP)
address, the client inherits the IP address of the Domain Name System (DNS)
server used by the remote access server, and not the DNS server IP address
assigned by the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) scope options. You
are unable to remove or change the IP address of the DNS server that is assigned
by the remote access server.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. The DNS server IP address is taken from the remote
access server (RAS) if the RAS server is configured with DNS server IP
addresses. The client acquires the first DNS server address listed in the RAS
server's DNS Service Search Order.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this behavior, perform the following procedure to remove the DNS
server IP address from a Windows 95 RAS client:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedit).

2. Locate the following registry key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\DHCPInfo00\OptionInfo

3. Change the value data for OptionInfo to 00.

  NOTE: The IP addresses for the DNS servers are given in hexadecimal format in
  the OptionInfo key. To determine the DNS server IP addresses currently in
  use, you need to convert the addresses from hexadecimal format to decimal
  format. Changing all hexadecimal numbers to 00 clears the DNS IP addresses.

4. Quit Registry Editor, and then restart the computer.
