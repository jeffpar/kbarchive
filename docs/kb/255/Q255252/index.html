SUMMARY
=======

Visual C++ was not specifically designed and tested to access and build projects
directly over a network. If you try to perform these tasks with Visual C++, you
will experience problems with building and performance. Visual C++ does not
perform any special operations to accommodate network drives and shares, and it
is unaware of whether the file it is reading or writing is on a network drive or
a local drive. Use of Visual C++ in this manner is not supported.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You will experience performance problems when you use Visual C++ to access
projects in the following configurations:

- Share a Visual C++ project on a Windows 98-based computer. On a computer
  running Windows NT 4.0, use Visual C++ to open the shared project. From the
  FileView tab, select a file and double-click to open it. You will experience
  a delay. This is due to the fact that Windows 98 is a nonopportunistic
  locking server. (If the same project is shared from Windows NT 4.0 or Windows
  2000, you might not experience this problem.)

- Share a Visual C++ project on a Windows 98-based computer. On a computer
  running Windows NT 4.0, map the share to a drive. Open the project from the
  mapped drive using Visual C++. You will notice that Visual C++ accesses the
  project's source and header files approximately every 4 seconds. (If the same
  project is shared from Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000, you might not
  experience this problem.)

There may be several other network configurations under which Visual C++
performance could suffer. For example; you may be using SAMBA to obtain files
from remote UNIX computers. SAMBA is a file service that attempts to emulate
Windows server message block (SMB) network file protocol.

Microsoft recommends that you use source code control software to obtain a local
copy of projects for use with Visual C++. Microsoft Visual SourceSafe is source
code control software that is optimized for use with Visual C++. There are other
source code control software packages available, but they may not be optimized
for use with Visual C++, so you may run into performance problems. In such
cases, contact the vendor of the source code control software for assistance.
