The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The design of the Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack update process requires an
additional logon with local administrative credentials after Update.exe has
restarted the computer.

If a non-administrative user logs on directly after the Service Pack Setup
process is run, two Application events are logged for ProtectedStorage:

  ProtectedStorage error: 5; OpenSCManager failed.

  ProtectedStorage error: 203; Install Service failed.

These events are logged at every logon until a local administrator logs on.

CAUSE
=====

Local administrative permission are necessary to successfully process and delete
all registry values under the following key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce

RunOnce values are processed with the current login credentials. A typical user
does not have sufficient permissions to successfully process the "4. 'Install
pstores.exe'='pstores.exe -install'" RunOnce entry, causing both of the events
listed above to be logged.

Also, a typical user by default has "Everyone=read" permission on the RunOnce
key, so the entries cannot be deleted.

Other Microsoft and third-party Setup procedures may be affected in a similar way
if they use the RunOnce or RunOnceEx keys to complete the Setup process during
next logon.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use either of the following methods:

- Have a user with local administrative rights log on to the computer.

- Use an administrative AutoAdminLogon and optionally disable the Mouclass and
  Kbdclass driver to prevent user interruption.

  This method involves certain issues. The password of the local administrator
  is stored as plain text in the registry (plus the corresponding script file),
  and a problem with disabled drivers can lead to an inaccessible system.
  Furthermore, be aware of the information on the following article in the
  Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q159969 AutoLogon Fails If DontDisplayLastUserName Is Also Enabled

Because of these issues, Microsoft recommends using the first method.
