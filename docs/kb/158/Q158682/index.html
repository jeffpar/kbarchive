IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows NT user may click a program's shortcut and be prompted to Enter
Network Password, yet the properties of the shortcut indicate a relative path to
the local computer.

This problem may become evident where server-based profiles are used and the user
logs on to a computer other than the one where the shortcut was created.

CAUSE
=====

Shortcuts created on a computer automatically embed a UNC (Universal Naming
Convention) path such as \\&lt;computer&gt;\admin$ in the .lnk file. The default
shortcut resolution method is to resolve the link to the original location of
the file (the "absolute" path) before looking at another path of where that file
may or may not exist (the secondary or "relative" path). In this case, the UNC
path to the original file is always reachable, which prevents the link from
being resolved by means of a local path. As a result, the user who is trying to
run the shortcut is prompted for the administrator's password of the computer
that created the link.

RESOLUTION
==========

Apply the updated Shell32.dll from the latest Windows NT 4.0 service pack and
then change the registry setting using one of the following methods for either
the computer or the user. This will change all existing shortcuts that are
showing the UNC path to the local relative path.

Use System Policy editor to create a policy file that is distributed when the
user logs on to the domain. The advantage of distributing the registry change
using Windows NT Policies is that users receive the change when roaming.

If the systems are in a workgroup environment, apply the policy to each user on a
computer. Because the policy change is on a per-user basis and the policies key
requires administrative rights, the user must have administrative rights to
change the registry setting.

As an alternative, the Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 Resource Kit, Supplement
One ships with a utility called Shortcut.exe, which modifies the actual shortcut
file and disables automatic link tracking of network shortcuts on a per-shortcut
basis.

Distribute the Change Per Computer
----------------------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


NOTE: If you are using Internet Explorer 4.0 and the Active Desktop, do not
install the Shell32.dll file because it may cause Internet Explorer and Windows
NT to not function correctly. However, the registry changes are still available.
If you are using Internet Explorer 4.0 without the Active Desktop, install
Shell32.dll as described.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To change these parameters, use the following procedure:

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

  \Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer

  NOTE: Add the Explorer subkey, if it does not exist.

3. Click Add Value on the Edit menu.

4. Add the following value:

     Value Name: LinkResolveIgnoreLinkInfo
     Data Type: REG_DWORD
     Data:  1 (enable)

5. Click OK.

6. Exit Registry Editor.

7. The user must log off and log on before the change takes place.

Distribute Change to Users in the Domain
----------------------------------------

In a domain environment, the change can be applied using Windows NT Policies.
Windows NT Service Pack 2 or later also ships with the appropriate Winnt.adm
file that contains the registry setting to enable the policy change.

1. Start System Policy Manager.

2. Enable: Default User\Windows NT Shell\Restrictins\Disable Link file tracking

3. Consult System Policy Editor Help or the resource kit for more information on
  using the System Policy Editor.

Change an Individual User

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and

in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To change these parameters, use the following procedure:

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. From the HKEY_CURRENT_USER subtree, go to the following key:

  \Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer

3. Click Add Value on the Edit menu.

4. Add the following value:

     Value Name: LinkResolveIgnoreLinkInfo
     Data Type: REG_DWORD
     Data:  1 (enable)

5. Click OK.

6. Exit Registry Editor.

7. The user must log off and log on before the change will take place.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After the Shell32.dll file has been applied, the system resolves the relative
path to the shortcut as expected. If the shortcut does not have a relative path
and contains the UNC name to the executable or file to which the user does not
have rights or cannot connect, the following message is displayed:

  The file or folder "&lt;filename&gt;" that this shortcut refers to cannot be
  found.

Knowledge Base:

  Q195887 Shortcuts Created Under Terminal Server 4.0 Resolve to UNC Paths

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
