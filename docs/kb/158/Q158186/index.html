-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Personal Web Server version 1.0 for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to establish a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) connection to a
Windows 95-based computer running Microsoft Personal Web Server version 1.0 for
Windows 95, you may be unable to do so. If you attempt to establish the
connection using Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.01 for Windows 95, the
following error message is displayed:

  Internet Explorer cannot open the Internet site ftp://&lt;site&gt;/.

  The login request was denied.

If you attempt to establish the connection using the FTP tool (Ftp.exe) included
with Windows 95, the following error message is displayed:

  530 User &lt;username&gt; cannot log in.
  Login failed.

If you attempt to establish the connection with another Internet browser or FTP
tool, a similar error message is displayed. Note that this problem occurs even
though Personal Web Server is configured so that the FTP service is running on
the computer you are attempting to connect to.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when the FTP service is configured so that no connections
are allowed. If the Allow Anonymous Connections check box is cleared and the
Allow Only Anonymous Connections check box is selected, no connections are
allowed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, configure the FTP service so the appropriate type of
connection is allowed. To do so, follow the steps in the appropriate section
below:

To Allow Only Anonymous Connections
-----------------------------------

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Personal Web Server.

3. Click the Administration tab, click Administration, and then click FTP
  Administration.

4. Click the Allow Anonymous Connections check box to select it and then verify
  that the Allow Only Anonymous Connections check box is also selected.

To Allow Only Non-Anonymous Connections
---------------------------------------

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Personal Web Server.

3. Click the Administration tab, click Administration, and then click FTP
  Administration.

4. Verify that the Allow Anonymous Connections check box is cleared and then
  click the Allow Only Anonymous Connections check box to clear it also.

To Allow Both Anonymous and Non-Anonymous Connections
-----------------------------------------------------

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Personal Web Server.

3. Click the Administration tab, click Administration, and then click FTP
  Administration.

4. Click the Allow Anonymous Connections check box to select it and then click
  the Allow Only Anonymous Connections check box to clear it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the Allow Anonymous Connections check box is cleared, Personal Web Server
does not allow anonymous connections to the FTP server. When the Allow Only
Anonymous Connections check box is selected, Personal Web Server does not allow
non-anonymous connections to the FTP server. Therefore, when the Allow Anonymous
Connections check box is cleared and the Allow Only Anonymous Connections check
box is selected, Personal Web Server does not allow any connections to the FTP
server.
