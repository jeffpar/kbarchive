SUMMARY
=======

This article discuss problems running GEX with some video cards.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following are confirmed problems with specific video cards:

- Alliance Promotion: Video card driver version 4.1.3409 can cause problems
  with MS-DOS sessions when using Windows 95 after playing GEX. To correct this
  problem, use video driver version 4.1.21 or earlier. If you do not have
  driver version 4.1.21 or earlier, contact your hardware manufacturer.

- ATI Rage 3D: As of this writing, GEX will run on this card. However, other
  games that use Direct3D may not run on this card because of incomplete video
  drivers. Contact your hardware manufacturer for updated drivers.

- Diamond Stealth 3D 2000: If you experience bad flickering or a garbled screen
  when running GEX in Full Screen mode, you may have an early version of the
  video driver from Diamond. Contact Diamond Multimedia to obtain the latest
  drivers for this card.

- Diamond GT: The DirectX installation overwrites the Diamond GT video driver
  with an incorrect driver. Contact your hardware manufacturer for updated
  drivers.

- Imagine 128 Series 2: DirectX installs a faulty video driver for Imagine 128
  Series 2 video cards. If you experience bad flickering or a garbled screen,
  reinstall the original video driver for this card or contact #9 to obtain the
  latest drivers.

- Matrox Impression: Currently there is no DirectX support for Matrox
  Impression cards.

- Matrox Mystique: As of this writing, GEX will run on this card. However,
  other games that use Direct3D may not run on this card because of incomplete
  video drivers. Contact your hardware manufacturer for updated drivers.

- Orchid Fahrenheit: DirectX installs a faulty driver for the Orchid Fahrenheit
  video card. Contact your hardware manufacturer for updated drivers.

- Rendition Verit: As of this writing, the current set of drivers for the
  Rendition Verit chip set does not allow GEX to run in Full Screen mode. Refer
  to your manufacturer for the latest update to the Rendition card with DirectX
  2.0 compatibility.

- S3 Virge: As of this writing, GEX will run on this card. However, other games
  that use Direct3D may not run on this card because of incomplete video
  drivers. Contact your hardware manufacturer for updated drivers.

- Weitek: Currently there are only beta drivers available for Weitek video
  processors, which includes Diamond Viper and SDIS video cards. Contact your
  hardware manufacturer for these drivers.

NOTE: Many DirectX related problems have been resolved in the latest version of
DirectX. Download the latest version of DirectX or, if you own a game that
installs a newer version of DirectX, install DirectX from the newer game's
disc.

The latest version of DirectX is available at the Following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/directx
