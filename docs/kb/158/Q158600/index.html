TROUBLESHOOTING

If you find that you are experiencing trouble, first check the following:

Encarta Encyclopedia uses custom fonts to represent special and
international characters. These characters usually don't correspond to
special characters within the standard Macintosh character set and will
appear as inappropriate or non-printing characters when copied to an
application such as SimpleText. However, these special and international
characters will print correctly if you print from Encarta or paste into
applications that support Rich Text Format (RTF) such as Microsoft
Office and Microsoft Works.

If you open files on the CD or enable File Sharing, Encarta may be
unable to eject the CD in your CD-ROM drive to swap discs. To fix this
problem, quit all applications running from the CD (e.g. Multimedia
Catalog, Microsoft System Information, SimpleText or the Encarta
Installer) and close any open documents on the CD (e.g. Encarta 97 Read
Me or QuickTime files). To disable File Sharing, open the Sharing Setup
control panel and click the "Stop" button for File Sharing. The button
name should change to "Start".

When you copy images or articles from Encarta, they sometimes contain
both text and pictures. Microsoft Word and Adobe PageMaker don't allow
you to use the Paste command if the clipboard contains multiple items.
Instead, you should use the Paste Special command, then choose whether
you wish to paste the text or picture.

The QuicKeys scrolling macros which QuicKeys installs by default do not
work correctly within Encarta. In order for the Home, End, Page Up, or
Page Down keys to work correctly within Encarta, these QuicKeys macros
will have to be disabled or removed.

Some versions of Now Menus will block the Command-/ keyboard shortcut
for Encarta Guide. To obtain upgrade information, contact Now Software.

Early versions of FWB CD-ROM Toolkit can cause broken audio and video,
as well as failures to eject the CD during disc swap. To obtain upgrade
information, contact FWB Software.
