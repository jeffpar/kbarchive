-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Flight Simulator for Windows 95, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start Flight Simulator for Windows 95, you may receive the
following error message:

  Fltsim95 caused an invalid page fault in module Simsui.dll.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following methods. After you complete each
method, attempt to start Flight Simulator. If the issue continues to occur,
continue to the next method.

Remove and Reinstall Flight Simulator in the Default Folder
-----------------------------------------------------------

The installation process for Flight Simulator does not allow you to create a new
folder. If you change the installation drive letter without also specifying a
folder name, Flight Simulator is installed in the root folder of the drive. To
resolve this issue, remove Flight Simulator and then reinstall Flight Simulator
in its default installation folder.

Restore Windows Video Driver (Windows 95 only)
----------------------------------------------

Replace the DirectDraw video driver with the original Windows video driver. To do
so, use the following steps:

1. Insert the Flight Simulator CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive. Press and hold down
  the SHIFT key when you insert the CD-ROM to prevent Flight Simulator from
  starting automatically.

2. Double-click My Computer.

3. Right-click the Flight Simulator (CD-ROM drive) icon, and then click Explore.

4. Double-click the Fs6 folder.

5. Double-click the Setup folder.

6. Double-click the Directx folder.

7. Double-click the Dxsetup.exe file.

8. Click Restore Windows 95 drivers. Follow the instructions on the screen.

9. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Yes.

Reinstall Windows Video Driver (Windows 95 only)
------------------------------------------------

To reinstall the Windows video driver, use the following steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Display.

3. On the Settings tab, click Change Display Type or Advanced Properties.

4. Click Change next to the Adapter Type box, or on the Adapter tab, click
  Change.

5. Click Show All Devices. Note the current manufacturer and model.

6. In the Manufacturers box, click (Standard Display Types).

7. In the Models box, click Standard Display Adapter (VGA), and then click OK.

8. Click Close until you return to Control Panel.

9. When you are prompted to restart the computer, do so.

10. Follow the instructions provided with your display adapter to reinstall the
  original video driver from the manufacturer's CD-ROM or floppy disk(s).

11. Start Flight Simulator. If you receive the error message, remove and then
  reinstall Flight Simulator. If you are prompted to update your video driver
  when you reinstall Flight Simulator, click No.

Check for Missing or Damaged Fonts
----------------------------------

To check for missing or damaged fonts, use the following steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Fonts.

3. Look for the Courier New font. If the Courier New font is not present, Flight
  Simulator may not start properly. For information about how to restore the
  Courier New font, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
  Base:

  Q152974 How to Restore the Default Fonts in Windows 95

4. Look for the Monotype Sorts font. Flight Simulator does not use the Monotype
  Sorts font; however, if the Monotype Sorts font is damaged, Flight Simulator
  may not start properly. If the Monotype Sorts font is present, move it to the
  desktop and then restart the computer.

5. If you continue to receive the error message when you start Flight Simulator,
  create a new temporary folder. Move all of the fonts from the Fonts folder
  into this folder, and then delete the original Fonts folder and create a new
  one. Move the fonts from the temporary folder into the new Fonts folder ten
  at a time. Restart the computer after you move each group of fonts into the
  new Fonts folder, and attempt to start Flight Simulator.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Reinstalling or restoring the original video driver without first changing to
VGA may not fully restore the original video driver. Changing to VGA and then
back to the original video driver forces the reinstallation of all the video
driver components.
