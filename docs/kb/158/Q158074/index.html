The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

ShivaRemote software can be used with the Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client to
allow users to remotely access a computer running Microsoft Exchange Server
(either by means of a computer running Windows NT with RAS or Shiva LanRover).
This article discusses the steps necessary to install and configure the
ShivaRemote software that ships with Microsoft Exchange Client to work
specifically over the IPX protocol. (For information about setting up Shiva for
use over other protocols, see the Reference section below).

When using ShivaRemote with the Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client, you must first
run Connect.exe from the Microsoft Exchange Client directory, establish the
remote connection, and then start the Microsoft Exchange MS- DOS client. This is
necessary because the Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client does not have any
built-in remote functionality. Therefore, with the Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS
client, there is no way to download only the message headers (remote mail
functionality).

MORE INFORMATION
================

You may see the following error message:

  Warning: Your IPX network number changed during connection. IPX services may
  not function properly.

This error should not cause a problem using the Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client.
Simply press ENTER and continue. In the Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client,
the IPX network number assigned to your computer changed while you were
connected to the remote access server. This can happen if you dial in to two
different remote networks in one session without restarting your computer
between connections. If you are using the Novell NetWare VLMs Version 1.2 or
later and ShivaRemote 3.5, you can ignore this error message and your
IPX-dependent software will function without errors. The later versions of the
VLMs have been designed to handle this problem better than earlier versions.
This warning message can be turned off by editing the Sremote.ini file and
changing the following line:

  [Options] NotifyIPXAddress=No

If you are not using the NetWare VLMs, or if you are using a version of VLMs
earlier than version 1.2, close the Dial-In connection and restart your
computer. Then dial in to the remote network again.

Installation of the Software
----------------------------

During installation of the Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client there is a dialog box
to select whether or not ShivaRemote should be installed. There is not a
separate Setup program for the MS-DOS version of ShivaRemote. Therefore, if you
are an MS-DOS-based user and you install the Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client
without ShivaRemote, and at a later date require it, you will need to rerun
Setup of the Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client. For MS-DOS, all of the
ShivaRemote files are copied to the Microsoft Exchange client directory.

Follow these steps to configure ShivaRemote for dial-in:

1. Manually edit your Autoexec.bat and Config.sys files as follows:

     Config.sys
     ----------
     device=c:\dos\setver.exe
     device=c:\dos\himem.sys
     device=c:\dos\emm386.exe noems
     shell=c:\dos\command.com /p
     dos=high,umb
     lastdrive=z

     autoexec.bat
     ------------
     c:\&lt;path&gt;\lsl.com
     c:\exchange_dir\dialodi.exe
     c:\&lt;path&gt;\ipxodi
     c:\&lt;path&gt;\vlm (or netx)
     set exchange=c:\exchange_dir
     set RPC_Binding_Order=ncacn_np,ncalrpc,ncacn_spx,netbios

  The net.cfg (nwclient directory)
  --------------------------------

     preferred server=servername
     Link Driver DIALODI

  Make sure you receive no error messages when starting with the newly
  configured Autoexec.bat and Config.sys files.

2. Run Connect.exe from the Microsoft Exchange install directory.

3. On the Tools menu, click Port Setup, and select the appropriate modem and com
  port.

4. Click the Options button and select the IPX (only) check box.

5. Specify a Description, Dial-in-Name (a Windows NT account that has been
  granted dial-in access on the server), Password (a password for the Windows
  NT account you are dialing in on), and Phone number. Note the account does
  not necessarily have to be the Exchange Mailbox Primary Windows NT account.

6. Dial the computer running RAS. (Microsoft Exchange Server supports dialing
  into either a Windows NT RAS server or a Shiva LanRover.)

7. Once connected, quit ShivaRemote Connect (on the File menu, click Exit).

  NOTE: The connection is maintained until you start Connect.exe again and click
  Disconnect.

8. Start the Microsoft Exchange MS-DOS client. Type the User Name (Exchange
  Mailbox Name), the Password (Windows NT Domain Password), and the Domain
  (Windows NT Domain Name that your Account is in).
