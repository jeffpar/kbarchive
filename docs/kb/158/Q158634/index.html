The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client on a Windows NT
Workstation computer using mandatory Windows NT profiles, you are unable to save
Exchange profile information. You can use the Exchange Profile Wizard to create
a profile and may be able to access your mail, but once you log off Windows NT
Workstation, all the Exchange profile settings are lost. Subsequently, when you
log on to Windows NT Workstation and you start Exchange Client, the Exchange
Profile Wizard starts.

CAUSE
=====

On a computer running Windows NT workstation, Exchange profile information is
kept in the registry. The purpose of mandatory Windows NT profiles is to
prohibit the user from modifying the registry.

RESOLUTION
==========

To use mandatory Windows NT profiles with Exchange Client, a unique user profile
file (.usr) must be created for each Exchange user. This file is kept on the
Windows NT server in the same location as the mandatory profile. This filename
must also be referenced in User Manager for Domains within the User Properties
for the user/Profile/User Profile Path. The user must log on and create an
Exchange profile and then log off Windows NT; this will save the profile
information to the registry and to the .usr file.

When the Exchange profile information is saved in the .usr file, the mandatory
profile can be reinstated. To do this, rename the .usr file to a .man extension
and reference this file in the User Profile Path described above.

To work around the problem, run the Microsoft Exchange utility Newprof.exe from
the Windows NT login script with a Default.prf configured with profile
information, including the Exchange Server name and the user's mailbox.
Newprof.exe can be placed in the Startup program group, or it can be run from a
batch file or login script so that a new Exchange profile is created
automatically each time the user logs on to Windows NT.

NOTE: No specific profile information can be saved by the user as long as
mandatory profiles are in use.
