SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses how to configure your computer to improve the speed and
display quality for GEX.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If gameplay is not as fast as you would like, make sure you are not logged onto
a network, and close any open applications. If gameplay is still slow, try the
following troubleshooting steps:

- Run GEX in Full Screen mode.

- If you are running GEX in a window (that is, a minimized display window),
  switch your game window size to 320 x 224.

- Restart your computer and Windows 95.

- Make sure your computer is at least a Pentium 75 with a minimum of 8 MB of
  RAM, and that it has a double-speed (2X) CD-ROM drive. Running the game on a
  computer with a lower configuration may result in performance difficulties.
- If your computer has a turbo button, make sure it is turned on.

- Change your display mode to high color (16-bit color) for best performance.
  GEX can be played in higher or lower-color modes; however, you may experience
  slower gameplay and minor game graphics color changes.

  To change your display mode to high-color:

  1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

  2. Double-click the Display icon.

  3. Click the Settings tab.

  4. Under Color Palette, click High Color (16 Bit).

- Playing the game in a large or maximized window may result in screen
  "tearing," poor frame rate, or slow gameplay. For better game performance,
  change your GEX screen resolution.

  To change your GEX screen resolution:

  1. On the GEX Options menu, click Display.

  2. Select either 320 x 224 or Full Screen.

  3. Click OK.

- If you still experience slow gameplay, make sure you are not running any
  background applications while playing GEX. Utilities that automatically
  perform functions at given intervals, such as System Agent, and applications
  that perform auto-scans and auto- defragmentation cause slower game
  performance during these functions. Running GEX in conjunction with these
  utilities may also interrupt gameplay.

- If GEX freezes or crashes:

  1. Make sure your computer is at least a Pentium 75 with a minimum of 8 MB of
     RAM. Running GEX on a computer with a lower configuration may result in
     hardware and performance difficulties.

  2. Disable the Sound Effects option:

     a. On the Options menu in GEX, click Sound.

     b. Clear the Sound Effects check box.
