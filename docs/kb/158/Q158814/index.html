SUMMARY
=======

If your FrontPage Web includes a frame set page, you can set a link to specify
the frame in which you would like a page to be displayed. This article explains
how to create a link that will be displayed as a Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
in a frame. (You can also use this procedure to display URLs in multiple
frames.)

NOTES:

- The code in this article will function only in a Web browser that supports
  JavaScript.

- ImageMap hot spots will only refresh one frame as extended attributes are not
  available in the Image Hotspot Properties dialog box.

To edit your hyperlink to update two frames, follow these steps:

Method 1
--------

1. In FrontPage Editor, open the page on which you want to create the link.

2. Select the text you want for the link and click the Link button.

  The Create Hyperlink dialog box (the Create Link dialog box in FrontPage 1.1)
  appears.

3. Click the Current Web tab or the World Wide Web tab. In the Page box, type
  the URL of the first page that you want to load.

4. In the Target Frame box, type the name of the frame set in which you want the
  first URL to appear.

5. Click the Extended button, and then click Add.

6. In the Name box, type "onClick" (without the quotation marks).

7. In the Value box, type the following code

  parent.frames[&lt;n&gt;].location.href='&lt;URL&gt;';

  where &lt;n&gt; is a number indicating the frame in which you want the
  resource to appear, and &lt;URL&gt; is the URL of the page that you want to
  appear in that frame.

  NOTE: Frame numbers start at 0; hence, parent.frames[2] indicates the third
  frame in a collection.

  For example, this code

  parent.frames[2].location.href='otherpage.htm';

  loads Otherpage.htm into the third frame in the collection. If you want to
  load additional frames, repeat step 7 for each frame you want to load
  (separate each new entry with a space).

8. Click OK three times to accept these changes and return to your page.

Method 2
--------

1. Point the hyperlink to a new frames page.

2. Set the initial pages of the new frames page to be the desired pages you want
  the hyperlink to point to.
