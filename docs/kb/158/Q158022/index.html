The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry. Before
you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the registry files
(System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the Windows folder.

When you use System Policy Editor to have a program run once by placing it in the
RunOnce registry key on the default computer or a particular computer, the
program may run every time a user logs on.

CAUSE
=====

With system policies, every time a user logs on to a computer the policy file is
downloaded and added to the registry. Therefore, the value is always placed in
the RunOnce key at startup.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should
make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you
edit the registry.

To cause a program to run only once, use one of the following methods:

- Use Remote Registry to open each computer's registry file, and place the
  program in the RunOnce key.

- Create an initial policy file with the RunOnce key enabled. After users have
  downloaded the change, edit the policy file to remove the RunOnce entry.

- Export and send the registry entry to users in e-mail. Users can double-click
  the .reg file to add the key to their registry. The program runs the next
  time the computer is started.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The RunOnce key is designed to cause a value to be executed only one time. When
you select the RunOnce key in System Policy Editor, the value you add is placed
under the following registry keys:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce,

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce

With system policies, every time a user logs on to a computer the policy file is
downloaded and added to the registry. Therefore, the value is always placed in
the RunOnce key at startup.
