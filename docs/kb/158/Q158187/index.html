The information in this article applies to:

- MSPRESS Official Microsoft Internet Explorer Book ISBN 1-57231-309-9 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article contains comments, corrections, and information on known errors
relating to the Microsoft Press book "Official Microsoft Internet Explorer
Book."

The following topics are covered:

- CD-ROM: Setup incorrectly creates Welcome icon for the Macintosh

MORE INFORMATION
================

In addition to a description of the book's problems, each entry in this document
might also include sections labeled "Correction" and "Comments." Please note
that the "Correction" section is worded for correcting the book and does not
necessarily address the problem introduced by the book error. The "Comments"
section contains specific information for working around the problem.

CD-ROM: Setup incorrectly creates Welcome icon for the Macintosh
----------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.1 for the Macintosh installs properly. However, the
Internet Starter Kit Welcome icon does not run properly, returning the following
two errors:

  'file:///IE Starter Kit/mac/english/demobin/globe.htm' could not be found.
  The attempt to load 'file:///IE Starter
  Kit/mac/english/demobin/globe.htm' failed.

  'file:///IE Starter Kit/mac/english/demobin/welcome.htm' could not be found.
  The attempt to load 'file:///IE Starter Kit/mac/english/demobin/ welcome.htm'
  failed.

CAUSE
=====

The Installation program, the Welcome page icon, and other included Web pages
look for the CD-ROM name "IE Starter Kit." However, the CD-ROM name is actually
"Internet Explorer 3.0 " (including the space at the end of 3.0). Therefore, any
references to the disc name "IE Starter Kit" fail.

WORKAROUND
==========

The following correction label has been added to the CD-ROM insert for the first
printing of this book:

***** BEGIN CORRECTION LABEL *****

ATTENTION MACINTOSH USERS:

After running the Installer program for Microsoft Internet Explorer, please use
the following steps to open the Welcome page instead of double-clicking the
CD-ROM's Welcome icon:

1. Insert the CD-ROM.

2. Double-click the CD-ROM icon.

3. Double-click the Mac folder.

4. Double-click the English folder.

5. Double-click the Demobin folder.

6. Double-click the Welcome.htm icon.

***** END CORRECTION LABEL *****

Correction:
Although the above workaround allows the use of all parts of the original CD-ROM,
Microsoft Press has developed a corrected replacement CD-ROM that addresses this
problem. The correction simply changes the CD-ROM name for Macintosh computers.
To order a replacement CD-ROM, please call the Microsoft Order Desk at (800)
360-7561. This corrected CD-ROM will be included with the second and all
subsequent printings of this book.

Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
already contain most or all of the above corrections.
