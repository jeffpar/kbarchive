-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Visual FoxPro View Designer displays fields incorrectly when the
view is based on tables from a Synergy/DE version 7.1 Driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

In most cases the following workaround can be used:

Create the view programmatically by using code similar to the following:

  CREATE SQL VIEW "FYF002" ; 
     REMOTE CONNECT "Synergex" ; 
     AS SELECT * FROM customers

NOTE: The view can then be manipulated visually as long as the tables from
Synergy/DE 7.1 have been added programmatically prior to editing the view
visually.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

NOTE: The following assumes that you have Synergy/DE 7.1 installed on the test
system.

The third-party products discussed in this article are manufactured by vendors
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
these products' performance or reliability.

1. Create a new database called "TestODBC" (without the quotation marks).

2. Create a new remote view, and then select the Synergy Driver Stand-alone from
  available Data Source Names (DSN).

3. In the dialog box that appears, enter your user id and password provided by
  Synergex Corporation.

4. Add the Public.customers table to the view.

Note the fields in the Customer cursor in the tables area of the view designer.
The fields listed are not those in the actual table, but appear to be system
information (t_database, t_owner, and so forth). The expected fields are:
Customer_id, Cust_rtype, Customer_name, Customer_street, and so forth.

NOTE: This behavior does not occur in Visual Basic or Microsoft Query.
