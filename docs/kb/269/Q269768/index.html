-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may be able to view Package Command Manager (PCM) client instruction files
that are located on the site and the logon servers that contain references to
packages that have been deleted.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if you deleted the packages manually instead of using a
"Remove package from server" job to remove the packages. In addition, the Run
Command job that sends the packages may have been deleted without being
cancelled first.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, delete the client's PCM instruction file from the
following locations:

- On the site server:
  \SMS\Site.Srv\Maincfg.box\PCMDom.Box\&lt;domainname&gt;.&lt;xxx&gt;

- On each Systems Management Server (SMS) logon server:
  \SMS\Logon.srv\PCMIns.Box

NOTE: The .ins files must be deleted from each logon server because the
Maintenance Manager service does not delete these files.

IMPORTANT: When you follow this procedure, any existing package instructions are
lost. Any packages that you want to run on the client must be sent with new
jobs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use the method in the preceding section to prevent a client from
deploying a package that it was not supposed to receive.
