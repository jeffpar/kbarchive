SUMMARY
=======

The IISADMPWD virtual directory is used for configuring Internet Information
Server (IIS) 4.0 so that it allows users to change their Windows NT passwords.
This virtual directory is not configured in Internet Information Services (IIS)
5.0, unless the installation is an upgrade from IIS 4.0. However, the .htr files
are still included in the Winnt\System32\Inetsrv\Iisadmpwd directory.

Because of the potential security risk that is introduced by the user's ability
to change their account passwords over the Internet, the IISADMPWD virtual
directory is not configured by default.

The "More Information" section of this article explains how to configure IIS 5.0
to allow this feature.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create the IISADMPWD virtual directory, follow these steps:

1. In the Internet Services Manager Microsoft management Console (MMC),
  right-click the Default Web Site, click New, and then select Virtual
  Directory.

2. When the Virtual Directory Creation Wizard starts, follow the instructions to
  create the virtual directory with the alias IISADMPWD. Make sure that the
  path points to the Winnt\System32\Inetsrv\Iisadmpwd directory, and that both
  Read and Execute permissions are selected.

To set the PasswordChangeFlags value in the metabase, do the following:

1. From a command prompt, switch to the Inetpub\Adminscripts directory.

2. Type "adsutil.vbs" (without the quotation marks), and then press the ENTER
  key. If this is the first time that Adsutil.vbs has been run, you may get
  error messages stating that Cscript is not registered. Follow the prompts and
  choose Yes to register Cscript.

3. Type "adsutil.vbs set w3svc/1/PasswordChangeFlags [value]" (without the
  quotation marks).

  "w3svc/1" (without the quotation marks) represents the Default Web Site and
  "[value]" (without the quotation marks) can be set to one of the following
  options:

  0 - SSL connection required
  1 - Password changing allowed on non-secure ports.
  2 - Password changing disabled.
  3 - Password changing disabled. (Undocumented)
  4 - Advance notification of password expiration disabled.

Users should now be able to change their Windows NT passwords.
