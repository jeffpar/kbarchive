The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP6, Terminal Server Edition

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, Service Pack 6
(SP6), any of the following symptoms may occur:

- Users may not be able to access information on servers by using either Citrix
  Server Administrator or Terminal Server Administrator. This behavior may
  occur sporadically.

- Csrss.exe processes may not terminate properly after a client session logoff.
  These orphaned Csrss.exe processes stop responding (hang) until you reboot
  the server.
