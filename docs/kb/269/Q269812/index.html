SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install one of the programs listed at the beginning of this
article, the computer may stop responding (hang).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following methods in the order in which they are
presented.

Quit Unnecessary Programs
-------------------------

Quit all unnecessary programs before you attempt to install the program. To do
this:

1. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE.

2. In the Close Program dialog box, click any program except Explorer or
  Systray, which are components of Microsoft Windows, and then click End Task.

  If you are receive a message stating the program has stopped responding, click
  End Task again.

3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 to quit all programs except Explorer and Systray.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Clean Boot the Computer
-----------------------

Clean boot the computer to determine if the issue is caused by a program or a
driver that starts automatically when you start the computer. To do this, use
the appropriate method for your version of Microsoft Windows.

Microsoft Windows 98:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "msconfig" (without the quotation marks), and then
  click OK.

3. Click "Selective startup", and then click to clear the following check
  boxes:

   - "Process Config.sys file"
   - "Process Autoexec.bat file"
   - "Process Winstart.bat file" (if available)
   - "Load startup group items"

  NOTE: If any of these check boxes are unavailable, the related file is empty
  or does not exist.

4. Click the Win.ini tab.

5. Click the plus sign (+) next to Windows to expand the branch.

6. Click to clear the "load=" and the "run=" check boxes, and then click OK.

7. When you are prompted to restart the computer, do so.

NOTE: To restore your original Startup options, click Normal Startup on the
General tab in the System Configuration Utility tool.

For more information about how to clean boot a Windows 98-based computer, please
see the "Narrowing the Focus" section in the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q192926 How to Perform Clean-Boot Troubleshooting for Windows 98

Microsoft Windows 95:

1. Restart the computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, press
  the F8 key, and then select Command Prompt Only from the Startup menu.

2. At the command prompt, type "win" (without the quotation marks), and then
  press ENTER. Press and hold down the SHIFT key until the Windows startup
  sequence is complete. This prevents any programs from being loaded
  automatically when Windows starts.

3. Disable any anti-virus or disk tool programs installed on the computer. For
  information about how to disable these programs, see the printed or online
  documentation for the program.

4. Quit all running programs except Explorer and Systray. To do this, see the
  "Quit Unnecessary Programs" method in this article.
