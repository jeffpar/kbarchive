SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade to Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional from Microsoft Windows
NT Workstation 4.0 with the MS Fax Service installed, the Windows 2000 Fax
Service may be missing. All of the files for the MS Fax Service are present, and
the registry entries for the MS Fax Service are present at the following
registry locations:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Fax

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Fax

However, there is no fax service listed under Services in Control Panel, and no
fax service is listed at the following registry location:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, manually install the fax service, using the Service
Control utility (sc.exe) from the Windows 2000 Resource Kit.

NOTE: Service Control (sc.exe) is a command line utility that allows you to
query, start or stop, and install or remove services locally or remotely.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Verify that you have the resource kit installed, and that the directory where
  the resource kit is installed is listed in the system variables path.

2. Start a command prompt and type the following line exactly as it appears
  here:

  "sc create fax binpath= c:\winnt\system32\faxsvc.exe Displayname= "Fax
  Service" " (without the quotation marks)

3. In Windows Explorer, right-click My Computer and select Manage.

4. Click Services and Applications, and then click Services.

5. In the right-hand pane of the Computer Management window, double-click Fax
  Service.

6. On the Log On tab, select Allow service to interact with desktop and then
  click OK.

7. Right-click the Fax Service entry, and then select start.
