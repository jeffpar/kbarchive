SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade your Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 hierarchy to Service
Pack 2 (SP2), Microsoft Windows 95-based clients may stop responding (hang)
during hardware inventory, when a Microsoft Outlook attachment is opened, or
when a Microsoft Office document is opened in Windows Explorer.

When this behavior occurs, the following error messages are logged in the
Hinv32.log file:

  WARNING 1 - Failed to update new cycle info !!! Hardware Inventory Agent
  7/24/2000 11:49:37 AM 4294127983 (0xFFF3316F)

  ERROR 1 - Cannot get schedule for previous cycle !! Hardware Inventory Agent
  7/24/2000 11:49:37 AM 4294127983 (0xFFF3316F)

Note that the Windows 95-based clients do not hang if you disable hardware
inventory.
