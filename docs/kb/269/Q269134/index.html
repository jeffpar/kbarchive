The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000

SYMPTOMS
========

When two or more types of Shared Folders clients attempt to attach to the same
AS/400 system through the same Local LU, only one type of client can connect at
any given time. For example, if a NetManage RUMBA Shared Folders client is
attached through SNA Server, and the SNA Server Shared Folders service attempts
to attach to the same AS/400 through the same Local LU, it fails.

When this occurs, a CPFAD08 message is sent to the QSYSOPR message queue on the
AS/400. When the SNA Server Shared Folders service is the client that fails, the
following symptoms also occur:

- When you attempt to access the drive letter for the shared folders drive, the
  following error message occurs:

  While accessing the hard disk, a disk operation failed even after retries

- Event IDs 38 , 91 , 5005 , 5001 , and 5007 (not necessarily in that order)
  are logged in the Application event log on the computer running SNA Server.

CAUSE
=====

Previously, when two types of Shared Folders clients tried to attach to the same
AS/400 through the same Local LU, the QPWFSERV job on the AS/400 would
occasionally use a large amount of CPU time. The only way to recover once it was
in that state was to IPL the AS/400. To prevent this from occurring, the AS/400
operating system OS/400 V4R4 now denies requests for a second type of Shared
Folders client to attach through the same Local LU.

WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid these error messages, Microsoft recommends that you configure a
separate Local LU for each type of Shared Folders client that will be attaching
to the AS/400.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To view the QSYSOPR message queue on the AS/400, type the following command at
an AS/400 command prompt:

  DSPMSG QSYSOPR

NOTE: You need appropriate rights to be able to run this command.
