The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0, on platform(s):
   - the hardware: Intel x86 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0, on platform(s):

- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0, on platform(s):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install a Visual Basic 4.0 32-bit application created using
the Setup Wizard, the following error message appears:

  Unexpected Error; Quitting

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the target machine has version 5.x of Olepro32.dll
installed but does not have version 2.20.xxx of Oleaut32.dll installed. This can
happen when Visual Basic 4.0 developers install an Office 97 application,
Internet Explorer 3.0, or Visual Basic 5.0 on their machine (thus installing
Olepro32.dll version 5.x), and then create a distribution using the Visual Basic
4.0 Setup Toolkit. The Visual Basic 4.0 Setup Toolkit includes version 5.x
Olepro32.dll in the files it installs. When an attempt is made to install the
Visual Basic 4.0 application on a machine that does not have the version 2.20
Oleaut32.dll, it fails as described above, leaving the updated version of
Olepro32.dll on the target machine.

Also, any application on the target machine that uses Olepro32.dll will no longer
work because Olepro32.dll attempts to forward calls into the new Oleaut32.dll,
which is not present.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Visual Basic 4.0 Setup Toolkit cannot be used to install the updated
Oleaut32.dll on the target system because doing so requires the system to be
restarted and the Visual Basic 4.0 Setup Toolkit does not have this capability.

To correct problems on target machines where installation was attempted, there
are two options:

1. Install an application that includes the new Oleaut32.dll onto the problem
  machines by installing any of the following apps: Internet Explorer 3.0 or
  Visual Basic 5.0 CC edition (downloadable from the Web), Office 97, Visual
  Basic 5.0, Windows 2000, Windows NT 4.0, or Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack 5.

2. Get the original Olepro32.dll from the Visual Basic 4.0 operating system
  CD-ROM and replace the 5.x version of Olepro32.dll with it. Machines that are
  not having problems do not need to delete any files.

You now need to recreate your installation so the problem will not re-occur. Do
this by copying the following components from the \vb\system directory of your
Visual Basic 4.0 CD-ROM:

  OLEPRO32.DLL
  MFC40.DLL
  MSVCRT40.DLL

to the following folder:

  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Basic\Setupkit\Kitfil32\sys32

Now recreate your distribution. Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0's Setup Wizard always
looks first at the above folder when searching for dependent files. When you
install your application, only less-recent files on the target machine will be
overwritten.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
