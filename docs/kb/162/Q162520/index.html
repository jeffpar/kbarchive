SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications GetAllSettings function
to return a list of key settings and their respective values, you may receive
the following error message:

  Run-time error '13': Type Mismatch

CAUSE
=====

If the value for "appname" or "section" does not exist in the registry, the
variable is uninitialized, and the Visual Basic Editor returns the "Type
Mismatch" error.

WORKAROUND
==========

to contact Microsoft, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

To work around this error, use a Visual Basic for Applications macro similar to
the following to verify that registry values exist:

  Sub GetAllSettingsExample()
     Dim vMySet As Variant
     Dim iCount As Integer
     ' Get registry settings.
     vMySet = GetAllSettings(AppName:="MyProjectName", _
        Section:="MySection")
     ' Make sure the variable is not empty.
     If Not IsEmpty(vMySet) Then
        'Display the Key Names and Values.
        For iCount = LBound(vMySet, 1) To UBound(vMySet, 1)
           MsgBox vMySet(iCount, 0), vMySet(iCount, 1)
        Next
     End If
  End Sub

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Visual Basic for Applications GetAllSettings function returns a list of key
settings and their respective values (originally created with SaveSetting) from
a user-defined entry in the Windows registry. This list is returned to a Variant
two-dimensional array, whose contents are a set of strings containing all the
key settings in the specified section and their corresponding values.

Syntax
------

Part      Description
-----------------------------------------------------------------
appname   Required. String expression containing the name of the
         application or project whose key settings are requested.

section   Required. String expression containing the name of the section
         whose key settings are requested. GetAllSettings returns a
         Variant whose contents are a two-dimensional array of strings
         containing all the key settings in the specified section and
         their corresponding values.
