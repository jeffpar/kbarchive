-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2 SP1, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After applying Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 1, client inventory
that previously functioned correctly while running Smsls or Runsms.bat may stop
responding at three to four percent during client inventory. A verbose output of
the inventory agent shows different messages, based on the type of client.

Client computers running Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups, or Windows 95
running the Smsls.scr logon script from a NetWare logon server will see the
following message:

  Found Path to SMS.INI
  Found Path to DOMAIN.INI
  Cannot find \\&lt;Netware Logon Server&gt;\SYS\SMS\LOGON.SRV\DOMAIN.INI
  Inventory cannot be taken

A client computer running Windows for Workgroups logging into a Windows NT Server
domain will see the following message:

  Found path to domain.ini

The client may also experience the following error immediately after the
message:

  An unexpected network error has occurred.

CAUSE
=====

The client is looking for the Domain.ini file on a randomly selected server,
rather than the current server.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, replace the Initmain.exe file from Systems
Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 1 with the version on the Systems Management
Server 1.2 compact disc, by copying it to the following directory:

  Sms\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\X86.bin

The file will be automatically copied to the logon servers' Sms\Logon.srv\X86.bin
directory during the next watchdog cycle. To speed up the process, you can
manually copy the file to the Sms\Logon.srv\X86.bin directory on all Systems
Management Server logon servers.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2 Service Pack 1.


A supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression-tested and should
be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you are
severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft Technical
Support for more information.
