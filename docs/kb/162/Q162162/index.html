SYMPTOMS
========

When you record a macro to find text formatted with a specific language, the
LanguageID property is not recorded.

WORKAROUND
==========

Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without warranty
either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied
warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular purpose. This
article assumes that you are familiar with the programming language being
demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug procedures. Microsoft
support professionals can help explain the functionality of a particular
procedure, but they will not modify these examples to provide added
functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific needs. If you have
limited programming experience, you may want to contact a Microsoft Certified
Partner or the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more

to contact Microsoft, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

After you record the macro, stop the macro recorder and edit the macro to include
the LanguageID property.

The following sample macro was recorded to find the word "test." In this example,
the LanguageID property has been added and the LanguageID constant has been set
to English (United States).

     Sub FindLanguageProofing()
        Selection.Find.ClearFormatting
        With Selection.Find
           .Text = "test"
           .Replacement.Text = ""
           .Forward = True
           .Wrap = wdFindContinue
           .Format = True
           .MatchCase = False
           .MatchWholeWord = False
           .MatchWildcards = False
           .MatchSoundsLike = False
           .MatchAllWordForms = False
           'Change the constant, wdEnglishUS, to
           'the language constant you want to
           'include as part of a search criteria.
           .LanguageID = wdEnglishUS   '&lt;---Add this line.
        End With
        Selection.Find.Execute
     End Sub
