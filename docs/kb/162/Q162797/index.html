The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to access a computer running Windows NT Server or Workstation that
is a member of your domain with one of the following methods, it fails with one
of the messages listed below.

- At a command prompt, type either of the following commands:

  Net Use \\&lt;ComputerName&gt;\&lt;Share&gt;

  -or-

  Net View \\&lt;ComputerName&gt;

  You receive the following message:

  System Error 1789 has occurred. The trust relationship between this
  workstation and the primary domain failed.

- You are in Server Manager and try to view the computer's properties. You
  receive the following message:

  The trust relationship between this workstation and the primary domain
  failed.

- You are in User Manager and try to add a user account from the Member Server
  or Workstation's database. You receive the following error message:

  The trust relationship between this workstation and the primary domain
  failed.

- In Event Viewer on the Member Server or Workstation, you receive Event ID
  5722:

  The session setup to the Windows NT Domain Controller &lt;Unknown&gt; for the
  domain &lt;DomainName&gt; failed because the Windows NT Domain Controller
  does not have an account for the computer &lt;ComputerName&gt;.

- When you attempt to log on to the console, you receive the message:

  System can not log you on to the domain because the systems computer account
  in its primary domain is missing or the password on that account is
  incorrect.

CAUSE
=====

The computer's machine account has the incorrect role or its password has become
mismatched with that of the domain database.

RESOLUTION
==========

Log on locally as a local administrator. In the Network tool of Control Panel,
select Change and enter a Workgroup name, leaving the domain. Restart the
computer and log on locally as a local administrator.

There are two methods to rejoin the domain:

- You can join the domain from the client if at the same time you can provide
  an administrator username and password on the domain.

  -or-

- You can delete the existing computer account in Server Manager, recreate the
  computer account, synchronize the domain, and then on the client rejoin the
  domain.
