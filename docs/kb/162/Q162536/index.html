The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server Event 336, "Cannot read Site Control file for site X
from database SQL Server Y" is produced on a primary site where large numbers of
Systems Management Server addresses exist.

CAUSE
=====

An image of the site control file Sitectrl.ct0 is stored in the Systems
Management Server database. Currently, the maximum size of this image that can
be read from or written to the database, is set by Systems Management Server to
256 KB. This allows for an approximate maximum of 1,100 sites to exist in a
Systems Management Server hierarchy.

Attempting to add an address for a new site that already has this approximate
number of addresses defined causes the Systems Management Server Hierarchy
Manager to produce event 336. You can examine the size of the Sitectrl.ct0 file
in the Site.srv\Sitecfg.box directory to determine if the Site Control image is
approaching its size limit.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2.


A supported fix is now available for version 1.1 only, but has not been fully
regression-tested and should be applied only to systems experiencing this
specific problem. Unless you are severely impacted by this specific problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Service Pack that contains this
fix. Contact Microsoft Technical Support for more information.

U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
