SYMPTOMS
========

The embedded ESS688 sound chip on NEC Versa 4050 notebook computer running
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 will not function properly when you use a PCMCIA (PC
Card) modem. As soon as the modem is removed and the system restarted, the sound
chip functions properly.

NOTE: The NEC versa 4050C is not currently supported for use with Microsoft
Windows NT 4.0. Please refer to the Windows NT 4.0 Hardware Compatibilty List
(HCL) included with your documentation for supported hardware.

An updated Hardware Compatibility List is available at the Microsoft Web site:
http://www.microsoft.com.

CAUSE
=====

If all other causes are eliminated, for example, IRQ or I/O conflicts, ESS
driver not installed properly, sound not enabled in the system BIOS (see Other
Troubleshooting Steps later in this article) there are three other settings in
the NEC Versa system BIOS that you need to configure properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Turn on the NEC Versa, go into the system BIOS routine and make sure the
following options have these settings:

- Infrared Port: set to REAR

- Serial Ports: set to ENABLED

- Infrared/Serial Ports: set to RECONFIGUREABLE

Save these settings and exit the BIOS utility. Turn off the notebook, insert the
PC Card modem, turn on the notebook, and start Microsoft Windows NT 4.0. If the
modem and sound devices are configured properly (see Other Troubleshooting Steps
to verify or change settings), the sound chip and the modem should now function
properly.

Other Troubleshooting Steps:
----------------------------

1. In the system BIOS, make sure that the sound chip is enabled.

2. In Windows NT, make sure that the ESS688 driver is installed.

3. If the driver is not installed, run the Multimedia tool in Control Panel.
  Click the Drivers tab, click Audio Devices, click Add, then select Unlisted
  or Updated Driver. Click OK, enter the path to the driver, click OK, and
  select ES688/ES1688/ES1788 AudioDrive 2.00.04 from the driver list. Click OK,
  supply non-conflicting I/O Address, IRQ, and a DMA Level (most often the
  defaults are acceptable - see step #7 for verifying available settings). For
  example, the system on which this article is based has audio settings of
  IRQ=7, IO=220, and DMA=1. The COM3 Port settings are IRQ=4 and IO=3E8.

4. In the Devices tool in Control Panel, verify that the AUDDRV is set for
  Automatic and is started after the driver is installed and the system has
  been restarted.

5. Verify that Audrive.sys is located in the %Systemroot%\System32\Drivers
  folder and has a file size of 62 KB, and is dated 5/13/96 or later.

6. In the Modems tool in Control Panel, verify the Modem settings. Look at the
  Attached To field and identify which COM port the modem is using. The
  following table indicates the default IRQ and I/O values used by specific COM
  port settings.

  When possible use standard settings for COM ports:

     SERIAL 1   COM1:  I/O Address = 3F8h   IRQ = 4
     SERIAL 2   COM2:  I/O Address = 2F8h   IRQ = 3
     SERIAL 3   COM3:  I/O Address = 3E8h,  IRQ = 4
     SERIAL 4   COM4:  I/O Address = 2E8h,  IRQ = 3

  Regardless of whether the modem is using the default settings (this can be
  confirmed in the Advanced Ports tools in Control indicated by the table, make
  sure the sound driver settings do not conflict. If they do, adjust the sound
  driver to use different settings.

  If the modem is using the default settings specified in the preceding Table,
  you need to ensure that the modem and sound driver settings do not conflict.
  To check the modem default settings, use the Advanced Ports tool in Control
  Panel.

7. Verify which IRQs and I/O addresses are currently in use (with the modem
  installed) by running Microsoft Windows NT Diagnostics in the Administrative
  Tools group and clicking the Resources tab; check both IRQ and I/O ports.

8. If the sound driver resource settings conflict with devices other than a
  configured COM port (for example, Network adapter), identify available IRQ
  and I/O resources and modify either the sound driver or other adapter to use
  those available resources, eliminating any conflicts.

9. Make sure that the PC Card slots are enabled. Try the modem in the other
  slot.

10. Try a different, supported PC Card modem.

11. If this is a non-HCL system (not on the Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Hardware
  Compatibility List), try a supported notebook or contact your hardware
  vendor.
