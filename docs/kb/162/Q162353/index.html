The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If you need to restore an Exchange Server computer and you are unable to recover
the Directory, you can still recover the information in the Private and Public
Stores. Typical methods to recover the Directory include running edbutil /d /r
/ds, or eseutil /p /ds in Exchange Server 5.5, or first recovering the Windows
NT security accounts manager (SAM) database.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To recover the information in the Private and Public Stores:

NOTE: If you run edbutil /d /r against a directory it is important to export the
information, reinstall Exchange Server, and then import the information.

1. If possible, from the Exchange Administrator Program, on the Tools menu,
  click Directory Export and export all Recipient containers on this server. If
  this server cannot be brought up long enough to get to this point, you can
  perform the Directory Export from another server, in the same or other site,
  that contains the Directory information for the users from this server.

2. In Services, in Control Panel, stop the Microsoft Exchange System Attendant.
  When prompted, click OK to stop all of the other Microsoft Exchange Server
  services.

3. Copy Pub.edb, Priv.edb, all Edb*.log files, all Res*.log files and Edb.chk to
  another folder or another server as a backup.

4. Start Setup.exe from the Exchange Server CD, and click Remove All when
  prompted. Verify and remove all Exchange directories (across all drives if
  Optimization was run).

5. Start Setup.exe again, and reinstall the server with the same Organization
  Name and Site Name as before. Be careful to make sure each name is typed
  exactly as it was before, because both the Organization Name and Site Name
  are case-sensitive.

  NOTE: Remember to reapply any Service Packs that were applied to the previous
  install.

6. In Services, in Control Panel, stop the Microsoft Exchange System Attendant.
  When prompted, click OK to stop all of the other Microsoft Exchange Server
  services.

7. Move all the files out of the Exchsrvr\Mdbdata folder (across all drives if
  Optimization was run). Copy to this folder all of the files that were copied
  to another folder or server in step 1 (Pub.edb, Priv.edb, all Edb*.log files,
  all Res*.log files and Edb.chk).

8. Start the Microsoft Exchange System Attendant and Microsoft Exchange
  Directory services in Control Panel, Services.

9. From a command prompt, change the folder to Exchsrvr\Bin, and carry out the
  following command:

  "Isinteg -patch" (without the quotation marks)

10. Start the remaining Microsoft Exchange Server services in Control Panel,
  Services.

11. Run the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator Program against the server
  you are recovering.

  NOTE: With a new directory it is important to re-establish Mailflow between
  any outstanding sites and Directory Replication before you proceed to Step
  12.

12. If there were any other Recipients containers aside from the default
  Recipients container, re-create them all. It is important that these
  containers have the same name and are nested (Recipient containers within
  Recipient containers) under the same containers as they were before the
  restore.

  NOTE: The users in nested containers may not be recovered if step 1 was not
  performed. For additional information, click the article number below to
  view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q154491 XADM: DS/IS Fails to Re-create Mailboxes in Subcontainers

  If step 1 was successful, perform only step 13 below. If step 1 was not
  successful, (no CSV file could be created), skip step 13 below and perform
  steps 14 through 16 below.

13. Using the CSV file created in Step 1, on the Tools menu, click Directory
  Import and import the Directory entries into the Directory.

14. Select the Server Object (Organization, Site, Configuration, Servers,
  &lt;servername&gt;), click File, click Properties (or press ALT+ENTER), and
  then click the Advanced tab.

15. Under DS/IS Consistency adjustment, click All Inconsistencies, and click
  Adjust.

  At this point, all Users should show up in their respective containers except
  those users who are in nested containers.

16. Go to the Properties of each individual mailbox on the server. At the bottom
  of the Properties box, click Primary Windows NT Account, and then click
  Select an existing Windows NT account, and then select the corresponding
  Windows NT account from the Add User or Group list.

After these procedures are done, the users should be able to log into the server
without having lost their mail messages and the public folders should have been
restored as well.
