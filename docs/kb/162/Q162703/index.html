SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to synchronize all folders from a client with an OST file, the
following error message appears:

  Synchronization with the offline folder file could not be completed.
  Consult the synchronization log in the deleted items folder for details.

Reviewing the synchronization log shows the following:

  11:43:26 Synchronizing Organization Forms
  11:43:27 Error synchronizing folder
  11:43:27       [8004010F-501-0-521]
  11:43:27       The client operation failed.
  11:43:27       Microsoft Exchange Server Information Store
  11:43:27 Done

The following MAPI code may be displayed in the synchronization log for the same
problem:

8:20:20 Synchronizing Organization Forms
Error synchronizing folder
8:20:25 [80004005-507-0-522]
8:20:25 The contents of this public folder are currently
unavailable. Either the Microsoft Exchange Server computer servicing this 
public folder is down or the public folder has not been  replicated to this 
site. See your administrator.

CAUSE
=====

This error generally occurs when the organizational forms library that has been
created has been deleted and recreated after the OST has synchronized the
library. The internal object ID of the new Organizational Forms library is
different from the original; the offline folder store encounters problems trying
to synchronize because it (the offline folder store) has the ID of the original.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the problem, verify the following:

- If the default permissions on the organizational forms library is set to
  None, the client will fail to synchronize. However, with these permissions,
  the synchronization log will contain:

     Error synchronizing folder
     [80004005-501-0-540]
     The client operation failed
     Microsoft Exchange Information Store

  The default permissions for the organizational forms should be Reviewer in
  order to prevent the above error.

- On all servers in the site that have mailboxes, verify that the Exchange
  Services were stopped and restarted after the new org forms library became a
  replica in the site.

- On the client side, the org forms library will synch correctly on the second
  logon and synchronization of all folders.

Note: If the Organization Forms Folder has been deleted, you can recreate it
using the Exchange Administrator program by clicking Forms Administrator on the
Tools menu, and the clicking New.

This can also occur in a situation where the replica of the original Organization
forms library has been removed from the Public folder. As long as the original
Organizational forms library has not been deleted, a replica can again be
created in the site and the error message will disappear after the folder has
been successfully replicated.
