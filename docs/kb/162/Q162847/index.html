SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to troubleshoot connectivity issues in Windows NT 4.0
with the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP). You may want to see the PPTP
information available on the Microsoft Web site (www.microsoft.com) before you
follow the steps in this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Installing PPTP
---------------

Installation involves installing and configuring PPTP on both a client and a
server computer.

Client Setup:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Network.

2. Click the Protocols tab.

3. Click Add, and then click Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol.

4. When you are prompted for how many Virtual Private Networks (VPN) to enable,
  click 1.

5. Click OK. When you are prompted to supply the Window NT 4.0 installation
  media, do so.

6. In RAS Setup, add the new Virtual Private Network (VPN) port by clicking Add
  and double-clicking the VPN port.

7. Configure the protocols to be used over the VPN port by clicking Network.

8. Click OK, click Continue, and then click Close. When you are prompted to
  restart the computer, do so.

Server Setup:

Follow the procedure outlined above to install PPTP on the server. Set up as many
VPN ports as will be required to support dial-in clients.

You can also configure the protocols available to each VPN port and specify
whether the port will have access to only this computer or the entire network.

Setting Up and Testing Internet Connectivity
--------------------------------------------

PPTP relies on the Remote Access Service (RAS). Therefore, RAS should be
installed, configured, and tested prior to installing PPTP. The Remote Access
Service can be installed using the Network tool in Control Panel. The TCP/IP
protocol is also required by PPTP and should be installed prior to PPTP. A
Dial-Up Networking phone book entry for your Internet service provider (ISP)
should be created and tested. Verify that you can successfully connect to your
ISP and obtain full Internet access.

For information about setting up RAS, Dial-Up Networking, and the TCP/IP protocol
to connect to the Internet, refer to Help in Windows NT.

For additional information, please see the following articles in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q161516
  TITLE : Troubleshooting Modem Problems Under Windows NT 4.0

  ARTICLE-ID: Q161986
  TITLE : Troubleshooting Internet Service Provider Login Problems

Testing Connectivity to the PPTP Server
---------------------------------------

Once the PPTP client and the PPTP server are connected to their ISPs, test the
connectivity between the two.

- Obtain the IP address of the PPTP server. This can be obtained with the
  IPCONFIG tool. On the PPTP server, start a command prompt inside Windows NT.
  Type the following command:

  c:\&gt;ipconfig /all

  This displays the IP address of the NDISWANx driver.

- Try communicating with the IP address of the PPTP server from the PPTP
  client. From a command prompt on the PPTP client, type the following
  command:

  c:\&gt;ping &lt;IP address of the PPTP server&gt;

  You should receive four responses from the server. If you receive a "Request
  timed out" message, the PPTP client is not able to communicate with the PPTP
  server.

Cannot Connect to PPTP Server
-----------------------------

The error message you receive will help determine what part of the PPTP
connection you should troubleshoot.

When PPTP filtering is enabled you may receive one of the following error
messages:

  Error 678: There is no answer

If you receive this error message, RAS Connection Manager and Remote Access
Server may not be started and may be set for manual startup. Start both and
change RAS connection manager startup to automatic.

  Error 650: The Remote Access Server is not responding

If you receive this error message, disable PPTP filtering and then attempt to
ping the PPTP server. To disable PPTP filtering, type the following command on
the PPTP server:

NET STOP RASPPTPF

You should now be able to ping the PPTP server over the Internet. If you still
receive one of these error messages, the problem may not be a PPTP problem.
Until you get replies from the server, you will need to troubleshoot this issue
as a normal connectivity problem.

If pinging the PPTP server across the Internet successfully returns with replies,
the ISP or internal corporate network may not allow Generic Routing
Encapsulation (GRE) packets or PPTP packets to go across the firewall or
router.

GRE packets are commonly used internally as messages between routers. For
example, an ISP may use GRE to distribute routing messages between its sites.
For security or other reasons, this ability may be turned off to the outside
Internet.

You can resolve this problem by ensuring that Protocol 47 is open at the router
or firewall. This protocol is required for PPTP to work correctly.

In addition to GRE Protocol 47, TCP port 1723 must be enabled at all routers or
firewalls between the PPTP client and server.

An example of a GRE-blocked PPTP call in a trace is shown below. In this case,
the ISP uses GRE internally, but does not allow the protocol to be sent to any
outside interfaces.

  ack:   168021449, win:

In frame 11, there is a reference that states the destination cannot be reached
in frame 10. Looking closely at frame 10, you can see that this packet is
actually a GRE packet:

+ FRAME: Base frame properties
+ ETHERNET: ETYPE = 0x0800 : Protocol = IP:  DOD Internet Protocol
+ IP: ID = 0xECB3; Proto = 0x2F; Len: 53
+ GRE: ..KS............ Length: 21, Call ID: 0  &lt;&lt;&lt;--Shows that this is a
                                                    GRE packet.
+ PPP: Link Control Protocol Frame (0xC021)
+ LCP: Config Req Packet, Ident = 0x00, Length = 17

The IP address in the IP portion of this frame shows the IP address of the device
that will not allow GRE packets past its interface.

NOTE: Some ISPs or corporate firewalls will not allow incoming or outgoing GRE
packets. In this case, you will see the same "Destination Host Unreachable"
packets in the trace, but there will not be any packets that drill down to GRE.

Timeouts Using PPTP
-------------------

If you receive error 718, "the server has not responded," you may want to
increase the number of attempts PPTP makes to transmit data.

You can make this change by editing the following registry entry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Go to the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value and use the following entry (if the entry
  already exists, just double-click it to edit the value):

     Value Name:    PPTPTcpMaxDataRetransmissions
     Data Type:     REG_DWORD
     Value range:   0 - 0xFFFFFFFF
     Default value: 9h

  By default, this value is 9h. You may want to increase this value to 18h. It
  is not recommended to increase this value beyond 27h.

If you are using the NetBEUI protocol to connect to a PPTP server, you may need
to install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3. For additional information, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q163129
  TITLE : RAS Client Fails to Connect to Service Pack 2 Using NetBEUI

Dialing the IP Address and Logging on to PPTP Server
----------------------------------------------------

After each computer can connect to its ISP and ping the PPTP server, test logging
on to the PPTP server.

- Set up a Dial-Up Networking phone book entry to dial the IP address of the
  PPTP server. When you set up the phone book entry, enter the server's IP
  address in place of a phone number. Dial using RASPPTPM.

- If Dial-Up Networking dials but does not connect to the PPTP server, try
  restarting the Remote Access Server service. To do so, follow these steps:

  1. In Control Panel, double-click Services.

  2. Locate the Remote Access Server service. Stop the service and then start
     the service.

Confirming Dial-In Permissions
------------------------------

PPTP requires that the connecting user account have dial-in permissions. Use the
Remote Access Admin tool to verify that the user account has the appropriate
dial-in permissions.

If a domain is present, the user may need domain permissions to connect to
certain resources on the network.

Troubleshooting Protocol Issues
-------------------------------

PPTP can use the NetBEUI, IPX/SPX-compatible, and TCP/IP protocols. The NetBEUI
protocol requires the least amount of configuration. Connecting to the PPTP
server requires that the client and server have a network protocol in common.
Once connected, the PPTP server can act as NetBIOS gateway to the rest of the
local area network.

When you are using the TCP/IP protocol, each client needs a unique IP address. IP
addresses can be statically assigned to clients, supplied from a pool of IP
addresses, or from a DHCP server.

The Ping tool can be used in troubleshooting connectivity issues with TCP/IP. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q102908
  TITLE : How to Troubleshoot TCP/IP Connectivity with Windows NT

Browsing Issues
---------------

Avoid browsing Network Neighborhood over a slow connection. Try connecting to the
network resource directly. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, and then click Run.

2. Type the following line, and then click OK:

  \\&lt;server&gt;\&lt;share&gt;

If you can connect with this method, the PPTP session is working properly and the
issue is related to browsing.
