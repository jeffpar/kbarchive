SUMMARY
=======

In Visual Basic for Applications, an object represents an element of an
application, such as a document, a paragraph, a sentence, a word, or a field.

A collection is an object that contains several other objects, usually, but not
always, of the same type. In Microsoft Word, for example, the Documents
Collection object contains all the open document objects.

At times it may be necessary when you write Visual Basic for Applications macros
to return the number of objects within a particular collection of objects.

This article discusses methods that can be used to return the count of a
collection of objects for part or all of a document including but not limited to
objects located in headers, footers, and different sections of a document.

Method 1: To Return a Count of Objects for an Entire Document
-------------------------------------------------------------

To return a count of objects for an entire document including those contained in
headers, footers, comments, endnotes, footnotes and text frames use the
StoryRanges Collection object.

A Story object is contained within the Story Collection. Members of the Story
collection are

- The Main Text or Body of a Document

- First Page Header

- First Page Footer

- Primary Header

- Primary Footer

- Even Pages Headers

- Even Pages Footers

- Comments

- EndNotes

- Footnotes

- Text Frames

For example, to count the number of fields in all stories of a document, use the
following example:

     Sub CountAllFields()
        Dim iCount As Integer
        Dim aStory As Range
        For Each aStory In ActiveDocument.StoryRanges
           iCount = iCount + aStory.Fields.Count
        Next
        MsgBox iCount
     End Sub

To count the number of Shapes(Drawing Objects) in all stories of a document, use
the following example:

     Sub CountAllShapes()
        Dim iCount As Integer
        Dim aStory As Range
        For Each aStory In ActiveDocument.StoryRanges
           iCount = iCount + aStory.Application.ActiveDocument.Shapes.Count
        Next
        MsgBox iCount
     End Sub

To count the number of Hyperlinks in all stories of a document, use the following
example:

     Sub CountAllHyperLinks()
        Dim iCount As Integer
        Dim aStory As Range
        For Each aStory In ActiveDocument.StoryRanges
           iCount = iCount + _
           aStory.Application.ActiveDocument.Hyperlinks.Count
        Next
        MsgBox iCount
     End Sub

Method 2: To Return a Count of Objects for Part of a Document
-------------------------------------------------------------

To return a count of items for a single member of the StoryRange, specify a
member of the story range with a wdStoryType constant.

In this example, the wdMainTextStory constant is used in conjunction with the
Paragraphs collection to return the count of paragraphs in the main text or body
of a document:

     Sub CountParagraphs()
        With ActiveDocument.StoryRanges(wdMainTextStory)
           MsgBox .Paragraphs.Count
        End With
     End Sub

In this example, the wdMainTextStory constant is used in conjunction with the
Sentences Collection to return the count of sentences in the main body of a
document:

     Sub CountSentencesInMainDocBody()
        With ActiveDocument.StoryRanges(wdMainTextStory)
           MsgBox .Sentences.Count
        End With
     End Sub

For more information about StoryRanges, from the Visual Basic Editor, click the
Office Assistant, type "StoryRanges" (without the quotation marks) click Search,
and then click to view "StoryRanges."
