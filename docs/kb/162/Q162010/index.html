SUMMARY
=======

When the Microsoft Exchange client tries to locate the computer running
Microsoft Exchange Server on a Novell network, it tries to locate a file server
for the Microsoft Exchange Server name resolution.

To do this, it sends out a SAP Nearest Service Query packet to get the nearest
NetWare file server. There are two ways it should get a response:

- If the file server is on the same subnet as the client, it will respond.

- A router responds on behalf of the servers on a different subnet, if and only
  if the router believes that no servers exist on the client subnet.

This is how most networks are configured, so the client gets a response from the
Nearest Service Query request from several file servers.

Once a NetWare file server has been located, its bindery is used to translate the
name of the computer running Microsoft Exchange Server into an IPX address.

On the network being used, when the file server is on the same subnet as the
client, but there is an internal network number defined on this server, the file
server acts as if it is on a different subnet. Because of this, it should act as
a router and respond to the Nearest Service Query.

But if "Respond To Nearest Service Query=OFF" is set on the NetWare server, it
does not respond to a Nearest Service Query. This setting is used in some
NetWare environments when people do not want all of their servers to respond to
this request. To enable this option, type the following on the NetWare Server
console: SET REPLY TO GET NEAREST SERVER=ON. If setting the SET REPLY TO GET
NEAREST SERVER=ON resolves the problem, add the entry to the AUTOEXEC.NCF file
on the Novell server. If this entry is not added to the AUTOEXEC.NCF and the
server is cycled, the problem will resurface.

If the Nearest Service Query fails, a General Service Query is issued. All file
servers on the subnet and routers will respond, including the one configured
with a different internal network number. When the Microsoft Exchange client
receives the response to the General Service query, it does not connect
successfully to the computer running Microsoft Exchange Server; it must have a
response to the Nearest Service Query.
