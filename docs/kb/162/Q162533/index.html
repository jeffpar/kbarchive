-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0 
- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Macintosh, version 4.0a 
- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use both the Windows version and the Macintosh version of Visual
SourceSafe to aid in cross-platform development, "File or Project Not Found"
errors might occur if you use operations on specific files that are added from
the other platform.

For example, you may get a "File or project not found" error when you try to
check out a Test1.cpp file on the Macintosh when the file was originally added
from the Windows version of Visual SourceSafe and vice versa.

CAUSE
=====

Non-alphanumeric file names are sorted incorrectly in the project file when they
are added from the Macintosh. You only see this problem if there are 2 files in
the project that have the same character sequence before a non- alphanumeric
character in one of the filenames. For example, given Filename.cpp and
File_name.cpp, the error usually occurs when you perform an operation on the
Filename.cpp file. However, wildcard operations are successful.

RESOLUTION
==========

Customers experiencing this problem should contact Metrowerks, Inc. for the
latest version 1.0.8 of Code Manager. After installing the new Code Manager
version use the command "mwcm_admin resequence" from Macintosh Programmer's
Workbench (MPW) to resequence the database. Depending on the size of the
database and the connection speed of the Macintosh to the Visual SourceSafe
database location, this could take some time. After you run the resequence, run
the analyze program from the Windows platform with the -f option. It may be
necessary to do this twice. The above information comes from the Upgrade FAQ
included in the Metrowerks 1.0.8 package.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. Metrowerks corrected the sort method used in its
version 1.0.8 of Code Manager (Macintosh Visual SourceSafe equivalent).
Microsoft does not provide Visual SourceSafe client software for the Macintosh
at this time. Customers using the 4.0 build 1322 Macintosh client provided by
Microsoft should contact Metrowerks for pricing and upgrade information.
