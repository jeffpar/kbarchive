SUMMARY
=======

When you change serial numbers on an MS Mail postoffice, you need to do more
than just change the serial number.

If you change a serial number and you do not perform the proper steps, you may
experience some or all of the following problems:

- Users cannot read new mail.

- Users who are currently logged on receive various error messages until they
  log off and log on again.

- Remote mail users cannot gain access to their mail.

- Asynchronous (async) postoffices cannot connect.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To avoid the problems that are listed in the "Summary" section of this article,
perform the following steps when you change a serial number:

1. Prepare the new serial number:

  a. Install new diskettes to a temporary directory, and make sure that you
     install the access component for all gateways.

  b. Turn on the global address list, if applicable.

  c. Copy the Access.glb, Access2.glb, Access3.glb, and Admin.nme files from
     old postoffice to new postoffice.

2. Create new init disks for all remote mail users. You can send this
  information as an attachment to the remote mail users. Tell these users to
  download the e-mail and keep it in their mail until the update. All remote
  mail users must receive this e-mail before the change or they will not be
  able to get into mail.

3. Send e-mail to all remote mail users to inform them of the change date.

4. Send the new serial number information to all administrators of asynchronous
  postoffices and inform them of the change date.

5. To make sure that all users log on and download all mail before you change to
  a new serial number:

  a. Rename the P1 directory to Pold.

  b. Send a message to all of the users on the postoffice.

  c. Check the current time and date. Wait a short amount of time, and then
     check the MMF directory to make sure that all MMF files have been updated.

  d. For any MMF files that are not updated, start the Administrator program
     and recover the user's password, and then log on to and off from the
     client to download all the user's mail, or the user will be unable to read
     any mail that is currently on the server.

6. Rename the existing Master.glb file to Oldmast.glb.

7. Add the new serial numbered Master.glb file.

8. Rename Pold to P1.

9. Make sure that all of the administrators of asynchronous postoffices have
  changed your serial number in the external setup.
