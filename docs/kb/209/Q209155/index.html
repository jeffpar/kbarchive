SUMMARY
=======

This article describes some of the issues that you may encounter when you play a
multiplayer game of Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator: WWII Europe Series.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following issues can occur when you play a multiplayer game of Combat Flight
Simulator:

- Symptom: When you attempt to start an Internet multiplayer game of Combat
  Flight Simulator, the game may stop responding (hang).

  Cause: This behavior can occur if you do not connect to the Internet by using
  Dial-Up Networking before you start Combat Flight Simulator in Full Screen
  mode.

  Resolution: To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods:

   - Press ALT+ENTER to play the game inside a window before you start an
     Internet multiplayer game.

   - Start your Internet connection before you start Combat Flight Simulator.

- Symptom: When you play a multiplayer game of Combat Flight Simulator, some
  aircraft may appear to fly through buildings or terrain features.

  Cause: This behavior can occur if either of the following conditions is true:

   - A player configured a different level of dynamic scenery or scenery
     complexity than the rest of the players.

   - A player installed a different scenery file than the rest of the players.

- Symptom: If you attempt to transmit visual models of other players' converted
  aircraft, you may be disconnected from the game or you may experience other
  erratic behavior.

  Cause: This behavior can occur if you use a modem connection to connect to the
  Combat Flight Simulator game.

  NOTE:If the host of a multiplayer game selects the Restrict Aircraft option,
  you cannot fly any imported or converted aircraft during that game.

  This includes the Sopwith Camel, which is an imported Microsoft Flight
  Simulator 98 aircraft.

- When you play a Squadron game in Combat Flight Simulator, you can see your
  team's score at the bottom of the Heads-Up Display (HUD).

  If you want to see your individual score, press the D key.

  NOTE: When you press the D key, your aircraft is put in a suspended state
  until you press the D key again.
