SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to install Visual Basic 4.0 for the first time, the following
message is received:

  Setup cannot access the required initialization file :
  'O:\VB4DROP\ENT-CD\SETUP\VB4-2.CAB : ACMSETUP.HLP : MSSTP32.DL_ :
  VB4SETUP.TTF : ODBCCP32.DLL : ODBCINT.DLL : MSVCRT40.DLL'.

CAUSE
=====

Installing on a compressed drive may fail if the uncompressed drive, usually
H:\, has more than 900K but less than 2MB free on it. This is due to an error in
SETUP.LST and SETUP16.LST on the CD. The value for TmpDirSize in
setup.lst/setup16.lst is set to 900. This tells the setup program that setup
need 900K of free space on the drive in order to create the temporary directory
(~msstfqf.t) for the install. The amount of room needed by Visual Basic 4.0 is
actually:

- 32-bit Enterprise and Professional Editions: 2000K

- 16-bit Enterprise and Professional Editions: 1250K

- 32-bit Standard Edition: 1500K

For example, when Visual Basic is installed on a computer using a compressed C
drive with drive H as the host, H will be used to create the temporary directory
because as host it is the boot drive. If the amount of space available on drive
H is under 900K, setup will use another drive. If the amount of space available
on drive H is over (about) 1800K, setup will use the H drive, and no problem
will occur. If the amount of space available on the H drive is between 900K and
(about) 1800K, setup will use the H drive, but it will fail due to insufficient
space.

WORKAROUND
==========

- For a floppy install, change the value of TmpDirSize in the setup.lst/
  setup16.lst file.

- Copy files to the host drive (typically H:) so that it has less than 900K of
  free space remaining.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in Microsoft Visual Basic
programming system version 4.0 for Windows. This problem has been corrected in
the Microsoft Visual Basic version 4.0a for windows synchronization release.
