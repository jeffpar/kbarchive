The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to send mail to a recipient in your Personal Address Book (PAB),
and this PAB entry was migrated from a version 3.x Microsoft Mail for Windows
mail message file (.mmf), you may get the following undeliverable message from
the System Administrator:

  Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

  Subject:msgsubject
  Sent:1/1/80 4:05:41PM

  The following recipients could not be reached:
  Migrated Ms Mail User (X400)' on 1/1/80 4:05:42PM
  The message was undelivered because the specified recipient postal address was
  incorrectMSEXCH:MSExchangeIS:sitename:SERVERNAME

CAUSE
=====

During the migration process of a .mmf file (either through the Migration Wizard
or Import menu option), the existing PAB entries are created in a Microsoft
Exchange Personal Address Book. With a Microsoft Mail X400 type PAB entry, all
of the fields in the recipients OR address are migrated regardless of whether
they contain data. For example, if a user created a X400 PAB entry in Microsoft
Mail using the X400 fields template as follows:

  Alias: User1
  Country Code: US
  Administration Domain Name:  (one space)
  Private Domain Name: MICROSOFT
  Personal Name: Surname: user1
  Given Name:
  Initials:
  Organization Name: SiteName
  Organizational Unit Names (OU):
  Organizational Unit Names (OU):
  Domain attribute type:
  value:
  Domain attribute type:
  value:
  Comment:

When the above is migrated into a Microsoft Exchange PAB, and a message is
addressed to this user, the address formed for the recipient will be as
follows:

  c=US;ADMD=;PRMD=MICROSOFT;S=User1;G=;I=;O=SiteName;OU=;OU=;DDA.TYPE=;
  DDA.VALUE=;DA.TY PE=;DDA.VALUE=

Even though the fields (G, I, and OU) had no value (ADMD contains a single space
and is valid) in the Microsoft Mail PAB entry, they were still migrated into the
newly formed address in Microsoft Exchange. Blank entries are invalid for X400
fields; therefore, the Message Transfer Agent rejects the message and the
Information Store returns it to the sender.

RESOLUTION
==========

The migration utilities were updated to parse out any blank or null fields that
exist in a Microsoft Mail X400 PAB entry. By parsing out these blank fields, a
valid X400 address is formed in the Microsoft Exchange PAB and messages will no
longer NDR. The same address as above will look as follows after you apply the
fix:

  C=US;ADMD= ;PRMD=MICROSOFT;S=User1;O=SiteName.

NOTE: The fix needs to be applied before you migrate the .mmf file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack 2. For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the
