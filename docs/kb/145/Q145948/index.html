- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 3.51

SYMPTOMS
========

NetWare client computers (using NCP) on one side (Side A) of a bridge are able
to log on to NetWare servers and File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW)
servers on both sides of the bridge. However, NetWare client computers (using
NCP) on the other side (Side B) of the bridge are able to log on to NetWare
servers and FPNW servers on Side B only.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the bridge is configured to forward RIP broadcasts one
way only - Side A to Side B. When a NetWare client attempts to log on to a
server, a RIP broadcast for the internal IPX network number of the server is
sent. The server then sends a direct response to the client, and the logon
process continues. If the bridge is configured to only forward RIP broadcasts
from Side A to Side B, the request from a client on side B does not reach the
servers on Side A. The client may re-try sending the RIP broadcasts several
times, which eventually returns an error.

If the server on Side A sends periodic RIP broadcasts (possibly once a minute) to
Side B during the re-try period, the client on Side B will detect the broadcast
because all packets sent or received after the initial broadcast are direct. In
this case, the client on Side B is able to log on to servers on Side A.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, configure the bridge to send RIP broadcasts in both
directions.
