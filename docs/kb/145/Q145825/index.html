SUMMARY
=======

The following article tells how to remove sounds in 3D Movie Maker. In 3D Movie
Maker, you have the option to remove sounds completely from the sound list, or
just remove them from the current movie.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Removing Sounds from Sound List
-------------------------------

These steps allow you to remove a recorded or imported sound from a movie, as
well as from the list of sound effects, speech, or music. To remove the sounds,
do the following:

1. Select the sound in the list of sounds.

2. Press your keyboard "DELETE" (without the quotation marks) key.

3. Click Yes to remove the sound.

This removes the sound from all characters and scenes in the movie. Sounds
installed by 3D Mvoie Maker cannot be removed from the list.

Removing a Sound From an Actor, Object, or Scene
------------------------------------------------

To remove a sound from a particular actor, object, or scene, do the following:

1. Open the movie.

2. Go to the frame where the sound is initially attached. Frames where attached
  sounds begin are designated by a musical note on the frame counter button.

3. Click the Listener tool to find the item to which the sound is attached. To
  find the Listener tool, on the top menu, click the Sounds options. The
  Listener tool is the ear icon on the second row. To hear the various sounds
  in that frame, move the mouse pointer (now shaped like an ear) over the
  background and objects.

4. When you find the object which has the sound attached to it, click the
  object. A volume control box displays, which shows the various sounds (sound
  effect, speech, and/or music) attached to the object in that frame.

5. Select the volume control for the sound type you want to remove from the
  movie. Drag the volume control all the way to the bottom next to the No Sound
  symbol (the international No symbol over a music note). Click OK.

6. Save the movie.

After you follow these steps, the sound is not attached to the actor or object,
but remains on the list of sounds.

Additional Removal Information
------------------------------

If you remove the last or only instance of a sound from an actor, object, or
scene that was recorded in or imported into 3D Movie Maker, you receive the
following message when you exit the current movie:

  You recorded or imported sounds that you didn't use in your movie. Do you
  want to:
  - Get rid of them before closing the movie?
  - Leave the unused sounds in the file?

If you might want to use the sound later in the movie, choose to leave the sounds
in the file. If you do not want to reuse the sound, choose to remove the
sounds.

You cannot remove sound list sounds installed by 3D Movie Maker.

If the sound you deleted from the movie was imported from a .wav or MIDI file on
your hard drive, the initial sound remains accessible from your hard drive, but
is no longer associated with the movie.

If you delete sounds from the movie which were recorded from within 3D Movie
Maker, the sound is removed completely from your system.

Sounds associated with a 3D Movie Maker movie use a special compression that
reduces the size of the sound so that it is smaller than the same sound saved as
a .wav or .mid file.
