MORE INFORMATION
================

In addition to a description of the book's problems, this document might also
including Correction and Comments sections. the Correction section is worded for
correcting the book and does not necessarily address the problem introduced by
the book error. The Comments section contains specific information for working
around the problem.

Page 24-27:  Various Corrections
--------------------------------

The following corrections should be made to the first printing of this book.
Please note that there have also been corrections made to the practice files for
Lesson 3. The corrected files are required to perform the steps for this lesson
in addition to the corrections noted below.

Correction:

Page 24: Step 5, change "Custdata" to "Custfind".

Page 24: Paragraph 1, Sentence 1, Change "Customer Find" to "Find Customer".

Page 25: Step 5, change "Customer List." to "Customer List, then click the
Continue button."

Page 27: Step 4, change "Select product #1002." to "Type the number 10002 in the
Product Code field, then press Enter."

Page 27: Step 1 under the heading "Take a customer survey", change "If the Ask
Survey checkbox is selected, select the Quit button to access the survey
screen." To "Select the Ask Survey checkbox, then select the Close button to
access the survey screen."


Page 28: Paragraph 1, change "Check the yes or no box based" to "Type Y or N
based"

Page  26:  Steps don't match book and cause error
-------------------------------------------------

Following the steps on pages 26 and 27 does not give results that match those
described in the book. You might encounter the following error when performing
Step 3 on page 25:

  File 'C:\VFP\CUSTMORE.SCX' does not exist.

Furthermore, clicking the Save Order button as instructed on page 27 will cause
the following error when you try to exit Microsoft Visual FoxPro 3:

  Table buffer for alias "orders" contains uncommitted changes.

Other error messages might also occur.

Correction:

Microsoft Press is developing a corrected set of practice files for Lesson 3 and
a small portion of Lesson 9, and will post new information in this article when
the files become available.


Until the correction files are available, Microsoft Press recommends that you
read through Lesson 3 but do not open the Proj_03 files.

Comments:

Once the Save Order button is pressed, you can properly exit Visual FoxPro by
following the steps below:

1. Return to the Order Form if you are not already there. (Follow the steps on
  pages 24-26 if necessary.)

2. Press CTRL+F2 to open the Command Window, then type:

  " =TABLEREVERT (.T.)" (without the quotation marks)

If Step 2 produces an error, cancel and then reopen the Order Form and repeat
step 2. You should now be able to close Microsoft Visual FoxPro

1. If the error

  Data session #1 cannot be released with open transaction(s).

  appears, return to the Command window and enter the command: ROLLBACK

Additional error messages might be encountered. Ignore these messages and close
Visual FoxPro by using the steps outlined above. These error messages include:

  Variable ORDERNUM not found.
  Function requires row or table buffering mode.

The following correction label has been applied to the disk envelope on the
inside back cover of the first printing of this book:


-----Begin Correction Label-----

IMPORTANT!
Do not perform the steps in Lesson 3. Corrected files for Lesson 3 are available
at http://www.microsoft.com/support/ (on the World Wide Web) in the Free
Software section.

The Lesson 3 practice files provided with this book contain errors that can cause
Microsoft Visual FoxPro 3 not to close properly. Please read Lesson 3, but do
not open the Proj_03 project.

Lesson 3 is a preview of what you will learn in Part 2, so these practice files
are not essential for working through the other lessons.

Closing Visual FoxPro 3 after using Proj_03 files: Information about closing
Visual FoxPro after using the Proj_3 files is located in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base. To access this information, connect to the FoxPro section of the Microsoft
Knowledge Base via

- the Internet at http://www.microsoft.com/support/ in the Knowledge Base
  section.

- MSN, CompuServe, GEnie, or other online services.

Enter the query "foxpro and bookbug" without quotes. We apologize for any
inconvenience this issue might cause.

NOTE: Because the Microsoft Web site is constantly updated, the site address may
change without notice. If this occurs, link to the Microsoft home page at the
following address:

Page 116:  CustFind form can't run- Error loading file
------------------------------------------------------

When trying to run the CustFind form, the following errors occur:

  Error loading file
  Error instantiating the object

These errors occur when the form tries to access the Customer table, which is not
currently open. To correct the problem, the Customer table should be added to
the data environment of the form.

For steps to modify the data environment, refer to Lesson 6.

Page 165:  glOldTalk variable misspelled in Figure
--------------------------------------------------

The following correction is under investigation by TLR, Inc. and will be verified
or modified in this article.

Page 165: In the Menu Designer screen capture, change the code line after ELSE
from "lgOldTalk = .f." to "glOldTalk = .f."

Page 231:  Duplicate code to verify existence of tables
-------------------------------------------------------

There is duplicate code in sections 6 and 7 of the listing on page 231. The
following duplicate code sections located after the comment "*-- one of the
index files is missing" can be removed but do not cause a problem if left as
shown:

- verify the existence of the relevant tables

...

- the one of the tables is missing

...

Page 272:  Practice Files work on more than just Windows 95
-----------------------------------------------------------

The last paper page of this book describes the Step by Step Practice Files disk.
However, it incorrectly states in the second sentence that the practice files
require the Windows 95 operating system.

Visual FoxPro 3.0 requires the Microsoft Windows 3.1 or later operating system.

Correction:

Page 272 ("Step by Step Practice Files Disk" page), sentence 2: Change "the
Windows 95 operating system." to "the Microsoft Windows 3.1 or later operating
system and Microsoft Visual FoxPro 3."
