-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Find By Word feature included in Microsoft Pregnancy and Child Care supports
the use of search operators.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before using the tips and tricks listed below, make sure the "Search article
text instead of article titles" check box is selected. The option is available
at the bottom of the Find By Word dialog box.

If you use the Find By Word feature, you can narrow the scope of a full-text
search by using the search operators AND, OR, ? and *

When you enter the search text, you can enter an operator in either lowercase or
uppercase letters. For example, "and" (without the quotation marks) is the same
as "AND". By default, multiple search operators are evaluated from left to
right. You can use parentheses ( ) to specify a different order.

NOTE: Operators within parentheses are evaluated first.

This Example                     Searches For
--------------------------------------------------------------------

baby AND food                    Articles containing both the word
                               "baby" and the word "food."

baby food                       Articles containing "baby" and "food"
                               (same as "baby AND food" above). AND
                               is the default operator.

baby OR food                    Articles containing "baby" or "food"
                               or both.

                               reproductive, and reproduce. ("*",

                               wildcard operator that is used to find
                               all words that begin with the same
                               letters.

                               character such as reproduce.

                               used to find all words that begin with
                               the same letters but have only one
                               character at the end.)

Stop-Word List
--------------

Microsoft Pregnancy and Child Care will not look for words that are in its
stop-word list. These are commonly used words that if used, can severely
lengthen the search time. The stop-word list contains the following words:
