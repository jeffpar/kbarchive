-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server 
- Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
- Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows 95 
- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
- Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0 
- Microsoft LAN Manager, version 2.2c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you browse a Window NT computer using the NET VIEW command from a Windows
95 or a Windows for Workgroups computer, the following error message appears:

  Error 234: Additional data is available.

On a LAN Manager 2.2c (MS-DOS) client computer, the following error message
appears:

  NET3513: More data is available than can be returned by LAN Manager.

When you browse a Windows NT computer using File Manager in Windows for
Workgroups, the following error message appears:

  An internal LAN Manager error occurred.

CAUSE
=====

These errors can occur if a share name of the Windows NT computer is greater
than 12 characters and/or contains a space.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure that all the share names on the Windows NT computer are 12 characters
or less and do not contain any spaces.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To ensure that the problems above do not occur, Windows NT File Manager, Server
Manager and the NET SHARE command do not allow share names greater than 12
characters. In addition, if the share name exceeds the 8.3 directory naming
size, the following message appears when you attempt to share the directory in
Windows NT:

  This sharename &lt;share name&gt; is not accessible from some MS-DOS
  workstations. Are you sure you want to use this sharename?

While the error does not mention Windows for Workgroups this could affect those
clients as well.

In Windows NT 4.xx, under the "Add Printer" wizard you will no longer received
any warnings about name length. Also under Windows 4.0 Explorer you will not
receive any warnings. Remember when browsing the browser returns ALL share names
so even ONE name will prevent the ENTIRE list from being returned. So, for
example, a too long data share name will prevent all printers from being
browsed.

However, the Windows NT Resource Kit utility, RMTSHARE.EXE, allows you to create
a share name that exceeds 12 characters. When you share a directory that exceeds
the 8.3 directory naming size using Rmtshare, the message above does not appear.
Therefore, there is no warning that the share name you create is not accessible
from an MS-DOS networking client computer or Windows for Workgroups.

If you use the NET USE command or Explorer in Windows 95, you are able to
successfully connect to the network share that exceeds 12 characters on the
Windows NT computer. If you use the NET USE command in Windows for Workgroups,
you are able to successfully connect to the same share. However, you cannot
connect to the same share using File Manager in Windows for Workgroups. If you
use the NET USE command from any of the MS-DOS client computers, you cannot
connect to the share.

The following is a sample Rmtshare command line syntax, which you can use to
create a share name that is greater than 12 characters:

  rmtshare \\NT_Server\Thirteen_char=c:\MyDir
