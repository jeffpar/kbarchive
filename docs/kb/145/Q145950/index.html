SUMMARY
=======

When you install Windows NT Server or Workstation version 3.51 on ALR's
Evolution V ST or Evolution V Ste, the install might fail after NT setup has
rebooted the system to go into the graphical mode portion of setup. It will fail
after NTDETECT and OSLOADER load. The system will Blue Screen with the following
message:

  STOP: 0x00000078 (0x00000000,0x00000000,0x00000000,0x00000000)

     PHASE0_EXCEPTION

MORE INFORMATION
================

ALR's Evolution V ST and Evolution V STe systems are multi-processor compatible
systems (Intel MP v1.1 specification). In cases where customers have received
this error, the system had a single processor, were supplied with Phoenix BIOS
4.04.x, and could be ordered with Adaptec's 2940 SCSI controller.

Troubleshooting Information:
----------------------------

1. STOP: 0x00000078 is typically an error related to either a RAM memory problem
  or a BIOS problem and these are the first items that need to be checked.

  a. Make sure that memory values, if configurable through CMOS or an EISA
     Configuration utility, match the amount of memory that is physically
     installed in the computer, either in SIMM slots and/or memory that
     physically resides on the motherboard.

  b. If the amount of memory is configured properly, make sure at system boot
     that the amount of memory the computer counts matches what is installed.
     If it does not match within at least 1 Mb, you might have a bad memory
     chip or one that was not be seated properly in the SIMM socket.

  c. If you've replaced or added memory chips, make sure that they are seated
     properly.

2. Since these systems can have both Phoenix BIOS 4.04.x or greater and Adaptec
  2940 with BIOS 1.16 or greater, you should obtain the most recent revisions
  for both the Phoenix and Adaptec 2940 BIOS.

  For additional information, please see the following articles in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q142013
  TITLE : Adaptec AHA2940 Related Problems

3. If you followed steps 1 and 2 with no success, try reinstalling NT, either
  from the boot floppies or a floppy-less CD-ROM install.

  a. Press F5 during the portion of Windows NT 3.51 Setup that displays the
     following text:

     Setup is inspecting your computer's hardware

  b. Select "Standard PC" from the list of computer types. This forces Windows
     NT Setup to use the uni-processor Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL).

  c. Continue with setup making any further configuration changes necessary
     (adding updated SCSI devices drivers or other mass storage drivers, and so
     forth).

  d. During the third system reboot that takes setup into graphical mode, the
     system should be able to successfully enter the graphical portion of setup
     without the STOP 0x00000078 and NT's final configuration settings can be
     completed.
