SYMPTOMS
========

Your two-way trust between Domain1 and Domain2 may experience a failure in one
direction. Domain1 may receive the following error message in Event Viewer:

  Event ID : 5770
  Source : NetLogon
  Description: The session setup to the Windows NT Comain Controller
  &lt;PDC1&gt; from computer &lt;PDC2&gt; using account &lt;Domain2$&gt;
  failed. &lt;PDC1&gt; is declared to be a BDC in domain &lt;Domain1&gt;.
  However, &lt;PDC2&gt; tried to connect as either a DC in a trusted domain, a
  member workstation in domain &lt;Domain1&gt;, or as a server in domain
  &lt;Domain1&gt;. Use the Server Manager to remove the BDC account for
  &lt;PDC2&gt;.

  where PDCx is the primary domain controller of Domainx and BDC is backup
  domain controller.

When you attempt to connect to the PDC of Domain2, you may receive the following
error message:

  The trust relationship between the primary domain and the trusted domain
  failed.

CAUSE
=====

User Manager on the Domain1 PDC incorrectly assumes that the Domain2 PDC is a
Backup Domain Controller in Domain1 and sends a validation request to it to
verify its Security Accounts Management (SAM) database. When the Domain2 PDC
attempts to connect as a PDC, the validation request fails.


RESOLUTION
==========

In NT 3.1:

Go to Server Manager and delete the duplicate computer name from the list of
servers. This BDC will need to be re-installed if it will be brought up on the
network. Or, the PDC can be re-installed that has the duplicate name.

In NT 3.5x / 4.0 :

If the BDC that is duplicated has been taken off the network, simply delete the
duplicate computer account from Server Manager on DOM1.

If the BDC and PDC need to coexist, the PDC (or BDC) can be renamed and rebooted.
The coinciding entry from Server Manager must also be removed as a result.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT. We are researching
this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
as it becomes available.
