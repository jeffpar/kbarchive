SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using file and printer sharing for Microsoft Networks with
user-level security enabled, a client computer may not be able to use the
Windows 95 Point and Print functionality.

When you attempt to drag a shared printer to the Printers folder, or drag a
document to the icon for a shared printer from a Windows 95 client computer, you
may receive one of the following error messages:

  The file 'DMCOLOR.DLL' on Network printer driver files could not be found.

  Setup could not find a file on the specified path. Please specify a new path,
  and then click OK.

  Resource type is not correct.

The Point and Print feature should locate and copy all the necessary files
automatically.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if user-level security is enabled on the Windows 95 server
and the client does not have access rights to the Windows\System folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, grant the client read-only access to the Windows\System
folder on the Windows 95 server. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click Windows Explorer.

2. Double-click the Windows folder.

3. Right-click the System folder, then click Sharing.

4. Click Add to add the client computer with read-only access rights.

  NOTE: You can add The World with read-only access rights to add all clients at
  once.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you share a printer using file and printer sharing for Microsoft Networks,
a hidden share called Printer$ is created. The Printer$ share is the
Windows\System folder on the Windows 95 server. The Printer$ share provides a
source for the printer drivers for the shared printer.

When a client uses Point and Print, the client computer is directed to the
Printer$ share to obtain the necessary printer drivers during the Point and
Print installation of the shared printer. When the server uses user-level
security, a lack of rights to the Windows\System folder for the client computer
prevents Point and Print from being able to read the files from the Printer$
share.
