-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit (ADT) in Microsoft Windows
95 to create a custom Setup program and distribution disks for Your application,
users who install your application on computers running Windows version 3.1 or
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 receive the following error messages:

- During the application's custom Setup program:

  &lt;Application name&gt; Setup not completed successfully

- When an OLE object is selected:

  There is a problem initializing MSAOLE20.DLL

Also, the following problems occur:

- No program group is created in Program Manager for the application.
- No SYSTEM.MDA file is created for the application.
- Embedded OLE objects appear empty or blank.
- File Manager, Microsoft Office, and other programs may generate the following
  error message:

  This application requires a newer version of Windows.

- Microsoft Access version 2.0 (MSACCESS.EXE) generates the following error
  message when you start the application:

  Couldn't open VER.DLL.



CAUSE
=====

The ADT Setup Wizard copies several system files to the Setup disks. If you
create the disks with Windows 95, but the disks are then used to install your
application on a computer running Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups 3.11,
the Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups 3.11 system files are replaced by
their Windows 95 equivalents. This can affect the following system files:

  COMPOBJ.DLL
  OLE2.DLL
  OLE2.REG
  OLE2DISP.DLL
  OLE2NLS.DLL
  STDOLE.TLB
  STORAGE.DLL
  TYPELIB.DLL
  VER.DLL

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid this behavior, run the ADT Setup Wizard on a computer running Windows
3.1 or Windows for Workgroups 3.11, if you plan to distribute your application
to anyone running those operating systems. There is no workaround available that
will allow you to create your disk images on a computer running Windows 95 and
then distribute them on a computer running Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups
3.11.

NOTE: If you use the ADT Setup Wizard with Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups
3.11, you can create custom applications that install and run successfully on
computers running Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups 3.11, or Windows 95.

NOTE: The above behavior does not apply to the applications that you create with
Microsoft Access 2.0 on Windows 95 computers. You can design your applications
with Microsoft Access 2.0 on computers running Windows 95 and distribute the
application to other systems running Windows 95.

To resolve the problems caused by installing an ADT application created in
Windows 95 on a computer running Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups 3.11, you
can replace the affected system files on the client's computer by decompressing
the VER.DLL file from your Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups 3.11
installation disks and installing the Microsoft Access version 2.0 Service
Pack.

NOTE: You must rename the affected files before you install the Microsoft Access
2.0 Service Pack.

Decompressing the VER.DLL File
------------------------------

To decompress the VER.DLL file, follow these steps:

1. Copy the DECOMP.EXE file from Disk 1 of your Microsoft Access disks to your
  Windows directory.

  NOTE: DECOMP.EXE can also be found on Disk 1 of the Microsoft Access
  Developer's Toolkit and the Microsoft Office 4.3 disks.

2. Find the VER.DLL file on your Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups 3.11
  installation disks. It is usually located on Disk 2 or 3.

3. Insert the Windows disk (containing the VER.DLL file) in a floppy drive, type
  the following line, and then press ENTER:

  " DECOMP &lt;drive&gt;:\VER.DL_ &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;directory&gt;\VER.DLL"
  (without the quotation marks)

  For example, to decompress the file from a disk in drive A to the
  Windows\System subdirectory on drive C, you would type the following line:

  "DECOMP A:\VER.DL_ C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\VER.DLL" (without the quotation marks)

The size of the VER.DLL file when expanded should be 9,008, 9696, or 12,144.

NOTE: In some cases, you may receive the error

  No header in file.
  File may not be compressed

when using DECOMP.EXE. If this happens, try using EXPAND.EXE."
