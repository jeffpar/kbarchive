SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses domain limitations in terms of the numbers of users,
groups, and computers in a domain, and the number of users in groups. The total
number of users, groups, and computers in the domain determines the overall size
of the security accounts manager (SAM) database. The way groups within a domain
are implemented also affects the size of the SAM database.

The following table represents general guidelines, which assume that the computer
functions only as a domain controller (DC) and that no other major Windows NT
services are running on the computer. This includes the following services: SQL
Server, SNA Server, Exchange, File and Print Services, Remote Access Service,
WINS, DNS, and DHCP.

All values are listed in megabytes (MB). This also assumes that the paging file
is at least 250 MB in size.

NOTE: The processor type is relatively unimportant in relation to the number of
users supported on a domain controller. Processor type is more important when
considering client authentication, and when domain controllers are used for more
than one purpose. For large domain operations, Microsoft strongly recommends
that your domain controllers be used only for user validation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Ultimately, the size of the SAM is constrained by the registry size limit, which
can be a maximum of 153.6 MB. If you assume that the non-SAM hives of the
registry consume no more than 3 MB, the theoretical maximum SAM size is
approximately 150 MB. Because of current hardware technologies, however, the
practical limitation is much smaller. The tests used to gather the information
for this article were initially performed using hardware available during the
first part of 1995. Additional tests using hardware available in the second half
of 1998 indicate that Windows NT domain controllers can handle more user logons
and larger SAM databases than the original recommendations.

Because of the way the registry is managed, differences in group membership
patterns, and variations in the frequency of SAM operations, it is difficult to
provide exact numbers and limits for capacity planning. This is why it is
important that administrators monitor the performance of their domain
controllers, especially as account operations push the size of the SAM over 40
MB (40 MB is the point at which Microsoft recommends administrators start adding
a new master domain). Using faster processors and large physical memory size,
domains up to approximately 60 Mb are useable with reasonable response times.
Observations of 80-MB SAM databases show noticeable performance delays in
routine operations and are not recommended. Routine monitoring can uncover
gradual degradation in performance that indicates the need for more processing
power or physical RAM, depending on the bottleneck discovered.

Some of the performance areas of the domain controller to monitor as the domain
size increases include:

- System boot time to first user operations. With a very large SAM database,
  this time increases as the system pages in the entire account database.

- Time to create a new local or global group increases as the total SAM size
  grows very large.

- As the membership of a group increases (as a percentage of total users), the
  time to add additional users to a large group also increases in very large
  SAM databases. For example, as the total SAM size increases above 60 MB,
  adding users to a group that already contains 20 percent of the total user
  accounts takes longer as more users are added to the group.

- For batch update operations, the time involved for adding a large number of
  users to the same group takes longer as the SAM database size increases above
  60 MB.

Replication of large SAM databases is also a consideration with respect to
network bandwidth usage. Domains use incremental synchronization for replicating
updates. Adding more users, computer accounts, and groups adds a variable amount
of network traffic depending on the frequency of password changes and group
membership change operations. For additional information, click the article
