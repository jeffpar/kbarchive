The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Excessive network traffic is generated after your losing contact with shared
resources on computers running Windows NT Workstation. For example, client A
shares a CD-ROM drive and client B connects to the share. Client A then runs
File Manager and removes the share without notifying client B or logging off.
Client B is still connected and performing work. As a result, a series of
directly addressable frames between the two machines try to figure out what
happened. Approximately 14 minutes later, Client B receives the message that the
network drive can no longer be found. No error message is recorded in the event
log.

CAUSE
=====

The problem appears to be caused by the Windows NT redirector, which is not
handling invalid Tree ID messages properly in some circumstances. This problem
usually occurs when you use File Manager, but can occur with other 32-bit
Windows-based applications, depending on how they are calling the WNet APIs.
This problem does not seem to occur when you use a command line utility.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. A fix to
this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for more information on the availability of this fix.
