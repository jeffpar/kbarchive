-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following message occurs repeatedly on the gateway screen and is repeatedly
written to the FAXGATE.LOG file:

  Failure to submit fax! Receiver &lt;phone #&gt;

The message is not returned to the user as undeliverable. The header for the
message remains in the fax queue until it is deleted or returned through the
ADMIN.EXE program.

This message is related to a specific fax mail item. Other fax messages can
continue to be sent through the gateway.

CAUSE
=====

This situation can occur when a fax mail item has an attachment that the CAS
driver rejects during submission. The program does not count this as a retry
attempt and the attempted submission continues on every faxout cycle.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.0.1 of Microsoft Mail
Gateway to Fax. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax "Administrator's Guide" explains this error in
Appendix A on page 105, as follows:

  ... you need to use the Administrator Queue option to return or delete the
  fax items.

Just returning or deleting the item from the queue is not enough to stop the
message. Even after returning the message from the queue, the error message will
continue. To stop the message, you must stop and restart the gateway. To avoid
lockups of the gateway, stop the gateway before it returns Fax gateway items
from the queue. After the failing item is returned or deleted, restart the
gateway.
