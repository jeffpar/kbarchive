SUMMARY
=======

The Site Configuration Manager component for Systems Management Server performs
numerous operations during its "watchdog" cycle. This article describes four
stages of the cycle. Each stage, as it is performed, can be monitored via the
service trace log file (SCMAN.LOG) for Site Configuration Manager located in the
root directory of the drive that Systems Management Server is installed in.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Stage 1
-------

a. Calculate if intervals have timed out for logon scripts, status file or user
  group mif.

b. Write site identification information to registry.

c. Write domains and logon servers to registry.

d. Write site account, addresses, outboxes, misc config information to the
  registry.

e. Write SQL Server information to registry.

NOTE: Steps b through e are only performed if a site control image (*.CT1) file
is detected. The alternative is that the Site Configuration Manager woke up due
to a polling interval, and there is no *.CT1 file present.

Stage 2
-------

The Site Configuration Manager reads the list of domains for the site (found in
the registry) and for each domain, it enumerates the servers to find all logon
servers. The logon servers are added to the registry and are marked as
pending-install if they are new.

Stage 3
-------

The Site Configuration Manager now uses the registry as the definition for the
site installation and verifies that the actual installation of domains and
components exist as defined. It removes any domains, servers, or components that
are marked as pending-uninstall and installs any that are marked as pending
install. For any that are marked as active, it verifies the installation.

Stage 4
-------

The Site Configuration Manager reports the installation status of the site by
writing a site control file (*.CT2) and sending this file back to the Hierarchy
Manager. If this site was installed remotely, a mini-job is used to send the
file to the parent.
