The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article lists high speed (28,800 bits per second [bps]) V.fast and V.34
modems supported by Windows NT 3.5 Remote Access Service (RAS) that are not on
the printed Windows NT 3.5 Hardware Compatibility List (HCL).

This article also discusses the V.fast and V.34 communication standards and how
they affect RAS. This information can be used to help you decide which modem to
buy, or if you already bought a modem, how to make your modem work with RAS.

NOTE: The V.fast standard is also known as V.fc. The fc in V.fc stands for fast
class.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you want to buy a supported modem for use with RAS, you should look for a
modem on the list below. When Windows NT 3.5 was released the final version of
the V.34 communication standard had just been defined and not many V.34 modems
were available. Therefore, most supported high speed modems comply only with the
temporary V.fast standard.

V.fast Modems, V.34 Modems, and Modems Supporting V.fast and V.34
-----------------------------------------------------------------

By early 1995, manufacturers provided upgrade paths for many of the listed modems
to support both V.fast and V.34 simultaneously. While there is no guarantee that
these upgraded modems are compatible with RAS, the chances are good that they
will work with RAS. However, if a V.fast modem was upgraded to only support
V.34, chances are higher that it has become incompatible with the current driver
in the RAS MODEM.INF file.

If you know how to use modem commands and know the syntax of the MODEM.INF file,
you can modify the MODEM.INF file to make your modem work with RAS. If you buy
an upgraded version of a V.fast modem listed below that now supports both V.fast
and V.34, few or no changes to the MODEM.INF file are required. However, the
modem may only be able to negotiate the V.fast standard with another modem when
used with the current RAS MODEM.INF file. This can be a problem when you call a
RAS server that has a plain V.34 modem. The V.34 standard does not define fall
back to V.fast during protocol negotiation, therefore your modem will connect
using V.32bis, the next lower communications standard which allows only 14,400
bps connections.

If you need to modify the MODEM.INF file, see the Modifying MODEM.INF topic in
the Windows NT RAS Help file and refer to your modem command reference manual.

If your modem is not on the supported list, check with your modem manufacturer
about the availability of a custom Windows NT RAS MODEM.INF file section to make
your modem work with RAS. If your manufacturer has a MODEM.INF section for only
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 RAS, you can use that section with Windows NT. If
you use a Windows for Workgroups RAS MODEM.INF section, Windows NT RAS will not
be able to autodetect your modem. However, this should not be a problem, because
you can select your modem driver manually.

V.fast and V.34 Modems Supported by Windows NT 3.5
--------------------------------------------------

The Windows NT 3.5 MODEM.INF file supports the following 28,800 bps V.fast and
V.34 modems. These are external modems, unless otherwise noted. There are only
two V.34 modems listed.

The Modem Names in MODEM.INF column lists the supported modems by using the
titles of the modem sections exactly as they appear in the MODEM.INF file. These
titles also appear in Windows NT Control Panel in the RAS modem selection list,
but without the square brackets. The list shows US modems in alphabetical order
and three German modems at the end.

The Supported Standards and Comments column gives some additional information,
but is not a complete list of modem features.
