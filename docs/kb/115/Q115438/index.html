-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, versions 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a message has more TO: recipients than the MTA can process, the system
logs:

  ERROR 1025 (allocating memory): allocating memory

Some recipients presumably will not get the message, but the originator receives
no indication of this.

Note: The number 1025 above refers to the number of bytes requested from
memalloc(); it is not an error code per se.

CAUSE
=====

No message is sent, so there is no possibility of some (X.400) recipients
getting the message and some not. And the sender does get a mail failure report.
It's not clear where the point of failure is.

The gateway uses more memory when translating the message from MSMail to
X400\OUTGOING than when sending the message from \x400\outgoing to the external
MTA, which implies that the gateway fails when translating the message to X.400.

RESOLUTION
==========

The FROM and SUBJECT fields of failed messages now are logged as WARNING
messages so the Administrator can easily spot a problem message and dequeue the
mail.

An initial failure to deliver the same message still causes the loop with "ERROR
allocating memory," but after a reboot the gateway logs the SUBJECT and FROM
information about the problem message in the X400xxx.LOG file, tries three times
to deliver the message, then deletes it and makes an entry in the SYSTEM.LOG
file:

  Failure to queue diagnostic back to sender, unknown error

The originator receives no indication of the failure.


The README recommends at least 400K free RAM for gateway operation.
