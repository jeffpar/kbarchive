The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS can backbone Microsoft Mail over
MHS, which enables automatic encapsulation of messages, including those
containing OLE objects, something not normally available over MHS. Encapsulation
passes OLEs through seamlessly and works around the fact that MHS messages are
text-based.

Backboning works only between Microsoft Mail postoffices defined as indirect
through MHS and with address mapping set up. When backboning is enabled, all
users appear to be normally defined Microsoft Mail users, even though the
transport between sites is MHS.

It also has the offset advantage of allowing directory synchronization messages
to be sent through MHS, even though to MHS the recipient is invalid.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Messages are sent from the Microsoft Mail user to the gateway in the Microsoft
Mail format. Normally, the gateway would read the header of the message into the
MHS format, it would read the body into the body of the MHS message, and it
would note any attachments. With encapsulation, the header is read to get the
sender and recipient details. The sender is changed to $Encaps@Gateway and the
recipient is changed to User1@gateway. The Microsoft Mail message format is
maintained by making the message an attachment to the MHS message.

An Encapsulated Message
-----------------------

  SMF 70 refers to the Simple Message Format the message was transmitted in.
  joeblogs@acmecorp {ACME/CORP/JOEBLOGS} Is the sender--an MS Mail user.
  230Sender: Is the sender. This field is not displayable.
  Send-to: Is the Recipient.
  Attachment: Name of the attachment in the corresponding attachment directory.
  Attachment-name: The name in MS-DOS of the attachment file.
  Attachment-date: The Date of the attachment.
  From: Note how the user's address differs from the nondisplayable 230Sender
  address.

  address.
  The body of the message contains the note "This is an encapsulated message"
  signifying a small mystery, now solved.
