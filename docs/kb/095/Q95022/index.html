SUMMARY
=======

ODBC provides five levels of transaction isolation. This article discusses the
concept of transaction isolation levels and the relation between ODBC and ANSI
SQL2 isolation levels.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Transaction isolation level refers to the degree to which multiple interleaved
transactions are prevented from interfering with each other in a multiuser
database system. Ideally, one would like to have "serializable" transactions -
that is, the interleaved execution of any set of concurrent transactions will
produce the same effect as some (unspecified) serial execution of those same
transactions. The ANSI SQL 2 standard defines three specific ways in which the
serializability of a transaction may be violated (with the implication that
these are the only permitted violations):

1. Dirty Read: Transaction T1 modifies a row. T2 then reads the row. Now T1
  performs a rollback - so, T2 has seen a row that never really existed.

2. Non-repeatable Read: T1 retrieves a row; then T2 updates that row and T1
  retrieves the "same" row again. T1 has now effectively retrieved the "same"
  row twice and has seen two different values for it.

3. Phantoms: T1 reads a set of rows that satisfy certain search conditions. T2
  then insert one or more rows that satisfy the same search condition. If T1
  repeats the read, it will see rows that did not exist previously -
  "phantoms".

These three phenomena are referred to as P1, P2 and P3, respectively. The various
isolation levels are defined by SQL2 in terms of which of these three violations
of serializability they permit. They are:

1. READ_UNCOMMITTED - Permits P1, P2 and P3.

2. READ_COMMITTED - Permits P2 and P3. Does not permit P1.

3. REPEATABLE_READ - Permits P3. Does not permit P1 and P2.

4. SERIALIZABLE - Does not permit any of P1, P2 and P3.

ODBC defines five isolation levels: SQL_TXN_READ_UNCOMMITTED,
SQL_TXN_READ_COMMITTED, SQL_TXN_REPEATABLE_READ, SQL_TXN_SERIALIZABLE, and
SQL_TXN_VERSIONING. The first four correspond to ANSI isolation levels 1-4
respectively. SQL_TXN_VERSIONING provides SERIALIZABLE transactions, but does so
without a significant impact on concurrency.

Transaction isolation is achieved by locking protocols. The various tables are or
parts thereof are locked so that two writers cannot access it at the same time,
or preventing reader access when writing is being done, and so on. One of the
side effects of this is to drastically reduce concurrency. Typically, isolation
levels 3 and 4 are achieved by locking protocols which drastically reduce
concurrency. SQL_TXN_VERSIONING refers a non-locking way of achieving levels 3
and 4, thereby increasing concurrency. An example of this is Oracle's Read
Consistency isolation level.

It is typical of many database systems to provide a lower level of isolation by
default and provide explicit concurrency control facilities to achieve
serializable transactions. For example, Sybase/Microsoft SQL Server provides
Level 2 locking (READ_COMMITTED) by default. But using the HOLDLOCK keyword
within a transaction will guarantee serializability. Similarly, IBM's DB/2
provides two isolation levels called CS (Cursor Stability) which corresponds to
READ_COMMITTED and RR (repeatable read) which corresponds to SERIALIZABLE.
However, it provides a LOCK TABLE statement which allows users operating at CS
level to achieve serializability of they wanted to.

Because of these differences in implementations, an interoperable ODBC
application must use SQLSetConnectOption to set the transaction isolation level,
instead of using the various implementation defined locking levels.
