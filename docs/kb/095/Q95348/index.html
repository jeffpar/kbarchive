SUMMARY
=======

To convert a Stacker version 2.x or 3.0 compressed floppy disk to a
DoubleSpace-compressed disk using the Conversion Disk for Users of Stacker, you
must have approximately 900 kilobytes (K) of free disk space on the floppy disk.
To convert a Stacker-compressed removable media disk (such as Bernoulli disks
and removable optical disks), you must have approximately 1 megabyte (MB) of
free disk space on the removable disk. The free disk space can be either at the
end of the Stacker volume file (SVF) or on the uncompressed portion of the
disk.

If you do not have enough free disk space to compress a removable disk and you
cannot remove any files to create more free disk space (or the disk capacity is
less than 900K [360K or 720K]), use the procedure below, which was taken from
the README.TXT file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

DoubleSpace requires 900K free disk space so that it can create a 512K
DoubleSpace compressed volume file (CVF). DoubleSpace also requires 400K- 500K
free disk space so that it can internally defragment a highly fragmented SVF.

If DoubleSpace cannot convert a Stacker-compressed volume file due to disk space
limitations, do the following:

1. Insert the floppy disk in drive A or B.

2. Copy the STACVOL.DSK file to the host drive on your hard disk. If you don't
  know which drive is your host drive, type "dblspace /list" (without the
  quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.

  When you copy the file, change its extension to .001. For example, if the
  floppy disk is in drive A, and your host drive is drive D, type the following
  at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER:

  " copy a:\stacvol.dsk d:\stacvol.001 " (without the quotation marks)

  If you have insufficient disk space, start DoubleSpace by typing "dblspace"
  (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt, and choose Change
  Size from the Drive menu. Make the size of the uncompressed drive large
  enough to contain the SVF.

3. Covert the compressed volume file to DoubleSpace format, as in the following
  example:

  dblspace /convstac=d:\stacvol.001

  After DoubleSpace converts the file, it mounts the file.

4. If are using Stacker version 2.0, delete the STACKER.DRV file on the floppy
  disk. If you are using Stacker version 3.0, delete the STACKER.EXE and
  README.STC files.

5. Delete the STACVOL.DSK file on the floppy disk.

6. Make sure your floppy disk is in drive A or B and then compress it by
  choosing Existing Drive from the Compress menu in DoubleSpace. Follow the
  instructions on your screen.

  DoubleSpace mounts the floppy drive after it finishes compressing the floppy
  disk.

7. Quit DoubleSpace.

8. Use the XCOPY command to copy all the files on the new compressed drive on
  your hard disk to the compressed floppy disk. For example, if the compressed
  drive is J, and the floppy disk is in drive A, type the following at the
  MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER:

  " xcopy j:\*.* a: /s " (without the quotation marks)

9. Delete the compressed drive on your hard disk. For example, if your
  compressed drive is J, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and
  press ENTER:

  " dblspace /delete j: " (without the quotation marks)

  To confirm the deletion, type "Y" (without the quotation marks).
