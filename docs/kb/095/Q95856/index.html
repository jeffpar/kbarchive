SUMMARY
=======

You cannot use the MS-DOS 6 Upgrade Uninstall disk to restore your previous
version of MS-DOS if you have compressed any of your hard disk drives with
DoubleSpace or a third-party disk-compression program unless you remove all
traces of the disk-compression software.


If you attempt to restore your previous version of MS-DOS and you have compressed
your hard disk drive with DoubleSpace, you receive the following error:

  Because you installed DoubleSpace after installing MS-DOS 6, you cannot
  restore your previous version of DOS.

For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have compressed you hard disk drive with DoubleSpace and would like to
restore your previous version of MS-DOS, query on the following words in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base and follow the procedure in the article about removing
DoubleSpace and preserving your files:

  " preserve and doublespace and remove and ms-dos " (without the quotation
  marks)

After you have followed the procedure in the article, restart your computer from
the clean hard drive, then place the Uninstall disk in drive A, and type:

  " a:uninstal " (without the quotation marks)

For more information about restoring your previous version of MS-DOS, query on
