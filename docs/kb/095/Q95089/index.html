The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows Sound System, versions 1.0, 1.0a, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Windows Sound System version 1.0, 1.0a, and 2.0 includes a tool
called Voice Pilot. This tool allows you to command and control Windows and
Windows-based applications by issuing verbal commands. Voice Pilot can be
trained to understand individual voices. The following tips may help in the
Voice Pilot training process and increase the percentage of correctly recognized
words.

Adjust the Recording Control
----------------------------

The input level indicator should register in the yellow when you speak.

Vary the Closeness of the Microphone
------------------------------------

Vary the distance of the microphone from your mouth (the closer the better).
Start with the microphone 8 to 12 inches from your mouth, and adjust as
necessary.

Adjust the Recognition Threshold
--------------------------------

If Voice Pilot recognizes commands that you have not issued, you can increase the
closeness of the match between the words you speak and the command Voice Pilot
recognizes, as follows:

Versions 1.0 and 1.0a

1. Choose the Menu button, and choose the Options command.

2. Adjust the slider to the right (toward the word "Exactly").

Voice Pilot now recognizes a command only if it exactly matches a command you
issue.

If Voice Pilot returns question marks instead of recognizing commands, you can
decrease the closeness of the match between the word you speak and the command
Voice Pilot recognizes by adjusting the slider to the left (toward the word
"approximately").

Version 2.0

1. Choose the Preferences Command from the Options Menu.

2. Adjust the Confidence Level slider to the right (toward the word "High").

If Voice Pilot returns question marks instead of recognizing commands, you can
decrease the closeness of the match between the word you speak and the command
Voice Pilot recognizes by adjusting the slider to the left (toward the word
"Low").

Remove and/or Substitute Difficult Words
----------------------------------------

If Voice Pilot has difficulty recognizing a specific word, you may want to
consider removing the word and creating a new vocabulary item to perform the
command. Voice Pilot is more successful when using polysyllabic words versus
monosyllabic words. For example, if Voice Pilot has difficulty recognizing the
word "Cut," remove "Cut" from the vocabulary list and add "Cut out" or "delete"
or "remove," then train the word to perform the cut function.

Remove Unused Words from the Active Vocabulary List
---------------------------------------------------

Voice Pilot's recognition ability may improve as the number of active words
decreases.
