SUMMARY
=======

To be able to properly access a SQL Server from an ODBC application on Novell
NIK, the correct net-library and the network name have to be specified.
Otherwise, you will not be able to connect. Also, there is a danger of breaking
the existing DB-LIBRARY (db-lib) applications.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft SQL Server Network Integration Kit for Novell NetWare (Novell NIK)
enables clients to communicate with Microsoft SQL Server and Microsoft Open Data
Services using the Novell IPX/SPX protocol. It eliminates the need for named
pipes support software on MS-DOS and Windows-based clients.

For the rest of this article, it is assumed that you are connecting to a SQL
Server called "Mysqlsvr" from an ODBC application, using Novell NIK. This is
server should be setup as an ODBC Data Source using the ODBC Administrator
Utility. Open up the ODBC Administrator, and choose SQL Server from the list of
installed drivers. Choose Add New Name. In the ODBC SQL Server Setup dialog box,
type a data source name. Note that a single server can function as multiple ODBC
Data Sources, because each database in the server can be a data source. So, the
data source name need not necessarily be the same as the servername.

Choose Add after typing in the data source name. In the resulting dialog box, the
Network Address field will have a default entry of the form:

  \\data-source-name\pipe\sql\query

This is actually a named pipe name. Because the Novell NIK does not use named
pipes, this name will not work. Change this so that it contains the actual
servername. In this example, this field should have "mysqlsvr". The Network
Library field has a default entry of dbnmp3. This is the net-library if you are
using named pipes. Change this to read "dbmsspx3". This is the net-library for
Novell NIK. Choose OK to get back to the initial screen. The addition of the
data source is now complete.

If this procedure is not done properly, then there is a possibility that the
existing db-library applications will be unable to connect. Specifically, this
will happen if the data source name is the same as the servername and the
changes described above are not made.

Finally, note that if the above procedure is followed correctly, then the
following changes appear in the ODBC.INI and WIN.INI files. The [Data Sources]
section of ODBC.INI will have an entry of the form:

  data-source-name=SQL Server

where "data-source-name" is the name of the data source that you added. There
will be a new section called [data-source-name] containing the location of the
SQL Server driver and a description of the data source. The [SQLSERVER} section
of the WIN.INI will contain an entry of the form:

  data-source-name=dbmsspx3,servername

Additional query words: dblib
