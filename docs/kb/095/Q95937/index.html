SUMMARY
=======

FILEEDIT demonstrates how to create a function in a dynamic-link library (DLL)
that is callable from a Microsoft Setup installation script. The entry function,
FileEditDialog, takes the handle to Setup's frame window and a long pointer to a
filename. FILEEDIT opens the file and places its contents in a read-only edit
control. The function then adds the line "REM New File" to the beginning of the
file and displays the updated file in a list box. Thus, the user can view both
the old file and the proposed updated file at the same time. The user can update
the contents of the new file by selecting lines within the list box. When the
user has completed updating the file, the file can be saved using the common
dialog boxes. If the file is successfully saved, FILEEDIT creates an entry
(FILEEDIT) in the global symbol table with the saved filename.
