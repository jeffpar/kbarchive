The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you upgrade version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks Mail
Server to version 3.1, you must remove the MCI CommGATE gateway prior to the
upgrade and re-install it after the upgrade is complete. If the gateway is not
removed and re-installed, it may fail to function.

To Upgrade to Version 3.1 with the MCI CommGATE Gateway
-------------------------------------------------------

1. Use the Gateway Installer application to copy the CommGATE Gateway
  Recipients. Log in to the gateway server as the Network Manager and launch
  the Gateway Installer. Select the CommGATE MCI gateway and select the Copy
  Accounts and Recipients item from the Gateway Menu option. Choose the Save
  button to extract a copy of the CommGATE Gateway Recipients into the CommGATE
  MCI Acct/Recip file.

2. Remove the CommGATE gateway by selecting Gateway:Remove Gateway from the top
  menu bar.

3. Upgrade the Microsoft Mail server to version 3.1.

4. Re-install the CommGATE gateway as described in the CommGATE Administrator's
  Guide.

5. Restore the CommGATE Gateway Accounts and Recipients using the Gateway
  Installer Application. Log in to the gateway server as the Network Manager
  and launch the Gateway Installer. Select the CommGATE MCI gateway and go to
  Gateway:Install Accounts and Recipients from the top menu bar. Select the
  Accounts and Recipient file that was created prior to the server upgrade
  (CommGATE MCI Acct/Recip) and choose the Install button.

Refer to the Server Read Me file for more information on upgrading servers and
gateways.
