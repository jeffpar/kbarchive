-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Versions 3.0, 3.1, and 3.1a of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks have the
ability to create custom forms using the Form Designer stack and HyperCard. In
addition to a familiar design interface, the HyperCard program includes a
powerful scripting language. When a form is compiled and installed, however,
common HyperCard scripts are ignored.

It is possible to add "compile" scripts to a form to add complex features. When
the Compile button is selected, it sends out a compile message. To customize a
form, it is possible to add code to that compile message and tell the compiling
script to set certain attributes for a particular object.

MORE INFORMATION
================

One feature that is available through these compile scripts is unavailable
(grayed) choices. On the default forms, there is a connection between the Send
button and the User List. If the User List is empty, the Send button is
unavailable. When a name is added to the user list, either as a pre-defined
recipient or via the Address window, the Send button is available for use.

It is possible to connect other buttons and fields together on a form by adding
the appropriate compile scripts. The following example shows how to add an Other
button that controls the gray of an "Other Info" field. When the Other button is
selected, the field next to it becomes available:

1. Create a check box named "Other" and a generic single-line field called
  "Other Info" on the Send screen.

2. Set the HyperCard user level so scripting is available. (Press COMMAND+M to
  show the message box and type: "set userlevel to 5" (without the quotation
  marks) and press the RETURN key.)

3. Choose the Button tool and double-click the Other button to display the Info
  box. Choose the Script button.

4. Add the following script to the Other button:

        on compile
            global objAttrib, attrDependCheckState, attrGroup3
           put modalAdd(objAttrib,attrDependCheckState, attrGroup3) into
        objAttrib
        end compile

  Note: The "put" statement should be on one line.

5. Select the Field tool and double-click the Other Info field. Choose the
  Script button from the Info box.

6. Add the following script to the Other Info field:

        on compile
           global objAttrib, attrDependSetState, attrGroup3
           put modalAdd(objAttrib,attrDependSetState,attrGroup3) into
        objattrib
        end compile

  Note: The "put" statement should be on one line.

7. Recompile the Send screen by choosing the Compile button.

The button and the field are put into an internal structure: "attrGroup3." The
button controls the "CheckState" of the group, while the field depends on the
"SetState" of the group.

When the button is checked, the field is available. When the button is clear, the
field is unavailable. (If the opposite effect is desired, change
attrDependSetState to attrDependSetNegState.)
