SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT and Microsoft LAN Manager Remote Access Service (RAS) can provide
access to remote clients as if they were on the local area network (LAN). If you
enable full RemoteListen functionality, all systems on the LAN can access the
RAS client just as if it were locally connected. The following features are
supported: IPC, mail slots, RPC, named pipes, and NBF/NetBEUI. This article is
divided into two sections:

- RemoteListen Functionality

- Enabling RemoteListen

RemoteListen Functionality
--------------------------

Beyond simply connecting to and accessing a remote client, these other mechanisms
function over RAS: IPC, mail slots, RPC (Windows NT), named pipes, and
NBF\NetBEUI. The following information describes the functionality of the three
different settings for RemoteListen:

- All

- Messages

- None

Note: You can only set RemoteListen for the RAS server. You cannot specify
different configurations for different clients.

All
---

LAN Manager: messages = all
Windows NT: RemoteListen = 2

The RAS Server posts an NCB_Listen network control block (NCB) for all client
NetBIOS names on each protocol bound to the RAS server.

Under LAN Manager, each client has an average of five NetBIOS names. This equates
to 80 names per protocol (16 ports x 5 names = 80). To support this many names,
you need to modify the MaxNames parameter for RAS and the Names parameter for
each protocol that you are using on the RAS server.

Under Windows NT, clients have an average of seven to eight names, and the RAS
Server can support up to 64 ports. This results in an even more significant
drain on resources than under LAN Manager.

Messages
--------

LAN Manager: messages = messages
Windows NT: RemoteListen = 1

The default for RemoteListen is set to Messages. This instructs the RAS server to
post only the Messenger service-related NetBIOS names for the client. This
allows them to receive things like print notifications and NET SEND commands.
This does not allow another LAN workstation to create a network session with the
remote client as in the case of a NET USE command.

None
----

LAN Manager: messages = none
Windows NT: RemoteListen = 0

This option instructs the server to not post any NCB_Listens for client NetBIOS
names. This reduces the resources consumed and the connect time. If you are not
concerned with any of the previously mentioned functionality, this is the best
setting to use.

Enabling RemoteListen
---------------------

To enable RemoteListen, add or modify the RemoteListen parameter:

For LAN Manager:

1. Open the LANMAN.INI file on the RAS server in a text editor.

2. Find the [RemoteAccess] section and add the following line:

  remotelisten = &lt;all, messages, or none&gt;

For more information, see the LAN Manager "RAS Administrator's Guide."

For Windows NT or Windows NT Advanced Server:

1. Start Registry Editor and go to the following subkey:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
  \RemoteAccess\Parameters\NetBIOSGateway

2. If you can find a RemoteListen key, choose Edit Value from the Edit menu and
  change the value to 2. If there is no RemoteListen key, choose Add Key from
  the Edit menu and use the following information:

  Value Name: RemoteListen Data Type: REG_DWORD Value: &lt;0, 1, or 2&gt;

For more information, see Windows NT "RAS Administrator's Guide"
