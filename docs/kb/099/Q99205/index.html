-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Following a successful installation of Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows as a
stand-alone user, if the USER_NAME.CAL file contains a space, the calendar file
may work for a period of time but an invalid calendar file is eventually
generated (the calendar file becomes corrupted and/or is unrecognized by
Schedule+).

This problem generally occurs when you use the Schedule+ Import and Export
commands from the File menu. Using either command generates an unexpected and
unrelated out-of-memory error message. In other cases, Schedule+ reports that
the calendar file is not a valid calendar file.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when you include a space within your Sign In name; for
example, "Jon Jones." This space is interpreted by Schedule+ as an underscore
(_) character.

If you try to manipulate the calendar file at the MS-DOS level, using the Copy,
Rename, or Type command, you will receive the following two errors in succession
and in the following order:

  CANNOT RENAME &lt;drive&gt;\&lt;subdir&gt;\[&lt;filename&gt;.CAL]

  CANNOT FIND FILE [&lt;filename&gt;.CAL]

NOTE: You may still be able to view and manipulate the information in the
calendar file.

RESOLUTION
==========

The only way to retrieve the current information in your calendar file is to
copy the desired appointments into another program, if possible, or retrieve the
information from a current backup.

After you copy the desired information, delete the local &lt;username&gt;.CAL
file from your Schedule+ directory and delete the SCHDPLUS.INI file from your
Windows directory. Start Schedule+ and create a new calendar file without
placing a space in the Sign In dialog box. Copy any retrieved information into
the new &lt;username&gt;.CAL file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 1.0 and 1.0a of
Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post
new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
