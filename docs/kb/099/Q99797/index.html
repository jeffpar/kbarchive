SUMMARY
=======

The following information concerns the Microsoft Windows for Pen Computing
sample Training Emulator, version 1 (TrainInk).

There is a sample called TRAINEM in the Microsoft Download Center. This Windows
for Pen Computing sample demonstrates how to do simple training on a trainable
handwriting recognizer. The sample utilizes the TrainInk application programming
interface (API) to do the training.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  Trainem.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/platformsdk/sample77/3.1/W31/EN-US/Trainem.exe)

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

Trainem.exe is a Windows for Pen Computing version 1.0 sample, which can be run
on any Windows version 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups machine that has the Pen
Extensions installed [from the Microsoft Windows 3.1 Software Development Kit
(SDK) or Visual C++ Development Kit.]

On a system that is running only the Pen Extensions and not the full Windows for
Pen Computing environment, the virtual keyboard executable may not be present
(SKB.EXE on U.S. systems) such that the ShowKeyboard call cannot bring up the
virtual keyboard. In this case, when the Keyboard button is pressed, a dialog
box will be displayed informing the user that the virtual keyboard could not be
started.

Trainem.exe demonstrates one of the training APIs used in training handwriting in
a recognizer. The TrainInk API is the simpler of the two training APIs
available; however, using it requires knowledge of recognizers and what they are
capable of doing. Therefore, Trainem.exe also demonstrates querying a recognizer
to determine whether it is capable of being trained; if so, the sample
demonstrates the limitations of that training.

Trainem.exe also demonstrates one method of capturing ink for training, and
displays an interface that a user can use to view that ink and train it to the
correct value. Note that during this process, ink can be captured and saved from
an hedit or bedit control, and textual information can be retrieved with
ordinary window messages.

As written, Trainem.exe requires the Microsoft default recognizer, also known as
the Roman recognizer, MARS. Note that the ConfigRecognizer call is resident in
the recognizer code itself and must be imported explicitly in the .DEF file. In
the more general case, not dealt with in this sample, an application could
install the recognizer at run time or query for the current recognizer and
obtain a pointer to the needed function. This sample uses the more direct and
easier method, though not necessarily the most robust method.

The sample also requires that some action be taken after a recognition session
has taken place in the main hedit control on the main window. The user must
choose either the Reset Hedit button or the Train button before further
recognition sessions are allowed in the control. The control is disabled until
training has taken place or until the control is reset.

This method was used to avoid losing track of the correct ink to train in the
hedit control. More sophisticated training programs might explore algorithms
that allow for tracking multiple recognition sessions, and bring up the
appropriate result and original ink on request for training. This sample is a
simple demonstration of the basics required for training a recognizer; more
sophisticated algorithms for handling multiple recognition sessions are beyond
its scope.
