-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to read a message in versions 3.0 and 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for
AppleTalk networks, the following message may be displayed:

  This message was sent using a custom form that is not installed on your
  server. Some information from the original message may not be displayed. To
  view the complete message, ask your network manager to install the form on
  your server.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if a custom form is not installed on the server, or the
form has been installed with an incorrect two-letter ID assignment.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With Microsoft Mail, custom forms can be created using the Forms Designer
HyperCard stack that is included with the product. All custom forms for
Microsoft Mail must be created and installed using the Forms Designer stack. If
a form is not installed on your server, you must obtain the HyperCard stack
containing that form, and use the Form Mover button on the Forms Designer stack
to install it. For more information on installing forms, see the Microsoft Mail
"Network Manager's Guide."

All custom forms in Microsoft Mail are defined by a two-letter ID. Built-in Mail
forms have lowercase ID letters; custom forms must use uppercase letters.

To determine the ID values for forms on a particular server, open a form in the
Forms Designer stack and click the Form Mover button. Forms installed on the
currently selected server will be listed, as well as the associated two-letter
IDs.
