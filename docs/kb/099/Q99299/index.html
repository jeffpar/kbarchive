SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive a "seek error" when you try to access files on your
DoubleSpace-compressed drive if Metro Software's LaserTwin version 5.0 (LT.EXE)
is loaded in memory and DBLSPACE /CHKDSK or CHKDSK has been run on the
compressed drive.

CAUSE
=====

LaserTwin is a printing emulation package that is loaded as a
terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program.

If LaserTwin is loaded in memory and you run DBLSPACE /CHKDSK or CHKDSK on your
compressed drive, the size of the DBLSPACE.00n file on the host drive is
truncated, possibly causing complete data loss.

Data on the compressed drive can be copied to another drive unless CHKDSK has
been run on the compressed drive a second time or the machine has been restarted
since CHKDSK was originally run on the compressed drive. Running CHKDSK a second
time on the compressed drive may cause further corruption to the DoubleSpace
file allocation tables and reduce the chance of recovering the data.

RESOLUTION
==========

Metro Software has confirmed this problem with LaserTwin 5.0 and is making an
update available to its customers. For more information, call Metro Software
Technical Support.

LaserTwin 5.0 is manufactured by Metro Software, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
