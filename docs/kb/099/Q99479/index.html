SUMMARY
=======

This article contains information to help you modify sections in MODEMS.INF to
accommodate modems not handled by standard means.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MODEMS.INF lists the expected responses for each modem type in a section using
the form seen in this example:

  [CODEX_2264.INIT.RESPONSE]
  OK=*cr*lfOK*cr*lf
  ERROR=*cr*lfERROR*cr*lf

Defaults are listed at the beginning of the file and exceptions are listed in
each modem's section, with .RESPONSE in the section header. Modem commands
depend on the modem (not all are 100 percent Hayes command set compatible), but
RAS does not understand BUSY, etc. so you must modify MODEMS.INF. The COMDEV.INI
file contains the name of the modem selected and points RAS to the MODEMS.INF
file for the appropriate strings.

E1 normally indicates "echo validated," but in some instances it means "enable
command state character echo," which is not the same thing as validating the
echo. (This can be done in the script file, but the modem performs no
validation, it simply echos the command.)

The setting S3=13 (CR) is a default. Some modems "forget" to echo the (CR)
character; to find out if a program is waiting for the complete echo of the
string sent to the modem, check the section of MODEMS.INF file detailing your
modem. See what the program is waiting for, then edit the MODEMS.INF file (use
any text editor) to make it compatible with your modem.

When you enter a Dial command (ATDT), some modems send a "crlf" or "crlfOKcrlf"
message before dialing and sending the expected answer. Here is how to deal with
these modems:

If you use ATQ0V1 ("return result codes" and "return result codes in verbose
form"), you get the message "CONNECT." If you use ATX3 or ATX4 you also get
"BUSY." Wait until you get these results and don't be concerned if you get
something else before. "CONNECT" or "BUSY" are always the last results before
you can enter a new command. If this does not work you might have a timing
problem. Check to see if you have to dial "BLIND" or increase the value of S7.
The best testing technique is to set S7 to the highest possible value listed in
your modem handbook.
