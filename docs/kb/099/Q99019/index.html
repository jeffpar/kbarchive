SUMMARY
=======

When you configure Microsoft Undelete for Windows by choosing the Configure
Delete Protection command from the Options menu, it adds the following line to
the end of your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

  " undelete /load " (without the quotation marks)

This occurs even if a LOADHIGH (LH) statement for UNDELETE /LOAD already appears
in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. To correct this problem, remark out (by using the REM
command) or delete the second occurrence of UNDELETE /LOAD.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have previously configured Undelete and then run MemMaker on your system
to optimize memory, or if you manually installed the LOADHIGH line in your
AUTOEXEC.BAT file for UNDELETE /LOAD, the modification shown above is still
added to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file the next time Undelete is configured in Windows.
The AUTOEXEC.BAT file then contains both lines as follows:

  lh /l:[region,size] undelete /load
  undelete /load

When you restart the machine and execute the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, the following
message appears:

  Cannot load with UNDELETE already resident.

To eliminate this message, open the AUTOEXEC.BAT file in a text editor (such as
MS-DOS Editor) and remark out the second occurrence of UNDELETE /LOAD or delete
the second line entirely.

NOTE: This second instance of UNDELETE /LOAD does not occur in the AUTOEXEC.BAT
file if an Undelete command appears without the LOADHIGH (LH) specification.
