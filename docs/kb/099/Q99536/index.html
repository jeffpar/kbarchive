SUMMARY
=======

Cross-domain and guest access issues can be confusing. This article discusses
some basic characteristics of these aliases.

Consider this example: your Windows NT Advanced server is the domain controller
for Domain\A, and you have problems seeing or using printers from LAN Manager
Domain\B. This could be a very simple problem: you are connecting to a printer
on a non-NT machine, so you must have the correct printer driver set up on your
own workstation. Often, however, it is a permissions/account problem. Here are
two possibilities:

Possibility 1: There may already be an account with the same name but a a
different password on the other domain or workstation.

Possibility 2: You are logged on as DomainA\john, and have no account on
Domain\B. Unless Domain\A is a trusted domain for DomainB you have to rely on
guest rights or secure an account DomainB\john with the same password you have
on your DomainA account. This is the same the way you must do things now with
LAN Manager.

Use the Administrator account to get access that is denied on other machines,
even if you could have secured guest access.

POSSIBILITY 1--PASSWORD PROBLEMS
--------------------------------

Why would the same account with different passwords cause access to be denied?
The Domain\B server receives a request "Hi, I'm john from Domain\A, my password
is q," and responds "You can't be john, that's not his password here--Access
Denied." If the request comes from an account that does not exist on the
Domain\B server, it responds "Well, I don't know you Biff, but I'll give you
guest access" (if the server has a guest account enabled).

In this regard, Windows NT and OS/2 LAN Manager are the same. There are some
differences, however, when trusted domains are involved.

POSSIBILITY 2--TRUSTED DOMAINS
------------------------------

The Domain\B controller may not recognize the request "I'm john from Domain\A, my
password is q." If Domain\A is a trusted domain, however, the Domain\B server
checks the password with the Domain\A controller, rather than simply deny
access. If the Domain\A controller says the password is correct for the account,
the Windows NT server checks the account's access privileges to the resource in
question and grants the same privileges allowed in Domain\A.

MS-DOS or OS/2 clients send the Windows NT server only their user name and
password because they do not support the extended Server Message Block (SMB)
protocol; Windows NT clients identify their domain as well, which the server
checks against the list of trusted domains. If it matches, the server grants the
requester the same privileges allowed in its own domain. If the account or
domain is unknown to the server, it compares the requester's password against
the guest account password (if that account is enabled) and grants guest
privileges if it checks out.
