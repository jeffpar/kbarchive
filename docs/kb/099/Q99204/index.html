The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

On page 25 of versions 3.2 and 3.5 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
"Administrator's Guide," under the section heading "Setting File Attributes for
High-Traffic Networks," the following incorrect statement appears:

  ...we recommend that you take the time to add a shareable attribute to all
  .KEY files and to .GLB files that are Read/Write.

NOTE: The section, "Setting File Attributes for High-Traffic Networks," has been
removed in later versions of the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks version 3.2
"Administrator's Guide" (printed after October 1993).

Please refer to page 439 of the version 3.2 and page 443 of the version 3.5
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks "Administrator's Guide" for the correct
information for setting file attributes.

If Shareable attributes are set to the CONTROL.GLB file, message corruption is
possible. The CONTROL.GLB file contains two long integers, which are used for
generating new and unique filenames. One integer is for generating names and the
other is for mail and attachment filenames.

Corruption is possible if two processes try to create messages at exactly the
same time. These processes can be anything that creates mail, such as the Mail
clients, Admin program, Gateways, and External and Dir-Sync processes. Although
this is unlikely, it is possible two processes grab the CONTROL.GLB and allocate
the same .MAI file name.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the same .MAI file name is allocated, External will display the following
errors:
