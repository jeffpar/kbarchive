-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An MFC-based ActiveX control cannot gain input focus when an SSTab control is on
the same form. This only happens when you click the MFC control (at which time
the MFC control should get the input focus) right after you have clicked one of
the SSTab's tab pages. The control works as expected when there is no SSTab on
the form or when you click the MFC control after clicking other controls, such
as the Visual Basic intrinsic TextBox. As an example, if the MFC control
aggregates a child Edit box control, and if you click it right after you've
clicked the SSTab's tab page, nothing can be typed into your MFC control's Edit
box.

CAUSE
=====

MFC ActiveX controls UI-Activate themselves when they receive the mouse- click
message. If you have a child control inside your COleControl, mouse- click
messages on the child control are not sent to the COleControl and MFC does not
UI-Activate the ActiveX control, even though the child control has just been
given the keyboard focus. When the SSTab gets the focus, your control needs to
explicitly UI-Activate itself to actually get the input focus when you click the
control.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two ways to resolve the problem. The first method needs to change the
MFC control's source code. The idea is to UI-Activate the whole control whenever
your control is activated. Usually, this is done with an event handler, such as
the following:

     int CMyEditCtlAppCtrl::OnMouseActivate(CWnd* pDesktopWnd,
               UINT nHitTest, UINT message)
     {
        OnActivateInPlace (TRUE, NULL); // UI-Activate the control
        return COleControl::OnMouseActivate(pDesktopWnd, nHitTest, message);
     }

The second method changes the Visual Basic code. The only change that needs to be
made is to call the SetFocus method of one of the controls on the form in the
SSTab1_Click event handler. Then, after you click the SSTab control, other
controls on the form can get the input focus.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

Steps to Create an MFC ActiveX Control with an Edit Child Control
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Open Visual C++. Select New from the File menu. Create a new MFC ActiveX
  control wizard project. Use MyEditCtlApp as the project's name and accept all
  the default settings. Click "finish" to actually create the project.

2. Add a contained Edit control object to the control by adding the following
  lines to the MyEditCtlAppCtl class declaration in the MyEditCtlAppCtl.h
  file:

        private:
           CEdit m_Edit;

3. Add the following line to the MyEditCtlAppCtl class declaration in the
  MyEditCtlAppCtl.h file to provide OnCreate message handling function:

        afx_msg int OnCreate(LPCREATESTRUCT lpCreateStruct);

4. Add the following line to the MessageMap (within BEGIN_MESSAGE_MAP and
  END_MESSAGE_MAP pair) in MyEditCtlAppCtl.cpp file:

        ON_WM_CREATE()

5. Add the following lines to the MyEditCtlAppCtl.cpp file to implement the
  OnCreate function:

        int CMyEditCtlAppCtrl::OnCreate(LPCREATESTRUCT lpCreateStruct)
        {
           // Call the base class's OnCreate
           if (COleControl::OnCreate(lpCreateStruct) == -1)
             return -1;

           // Create the edit control
           CRect rClient;
           CString strTemp = "";
           GetClientRect(rClient);
           m_Edit.Create(WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE | WS_VSCROLL | WS_OVERLAPPED |
                  WS_CLIPSIBLINGS | ES_MULTILINE | ES_WANTRETURN,
                  rClient, this, 123L);
           m_Edit.SetWindowText(strTemp);
           return 0;
         }

6. Build the project by pressing the F7 key or selecting "Build
  MyEditCtlApp.ocx" from the Build menu and the control will be automatically
  registered.

Steps to Create a Visual Basic Test Project
-------------------------------------------

1. Open Visual Basic and create a Visual Basic standard EXE project. Form1 is
  created by default.

2. Choose "Components" from the Project menu to bring up the project components
  dialog. Find "MyEditCtlApp ActiveX Control Module" in the list and select the
  checkbox beside of it. Click on the "Apply" button and a new icon with "ocx"
  will be added to the tool box. You may then close the components dialog.

3. Add a MyEditCtlApp control to the form.

4. Run the application. You can click the control and type in characters without
  problem.

5. Stop the application.

6. Choose "Components" from the Project menu to bring up the project components
  dialog. Find "Microsoft Tabbed Dialog Control 6.0" in the list and select the
  checkbox beside of it. Click on the "Apply" button and an icon for the tab
  control will be added to the tool box. You can then close the components
  dialog.

7. Put an SSTab control to the form and enlarge it so that it can hold other
  controls.

8. Put a MyEditCtlApp controls on SSTab tab0 and tab1.

9. Run the application. Now, if you click the SSTab control's tab0, tab1, etc.,
  and then click any MyEditCtlApp control, you cannot type in any characters.
  This is the problem.

Steps to Fix the Problem in C++
-------------------------------

1. Open the MyEditCtlApp project in Visual C++.

2. Add the following line to the MyEditCtlAppCtl class declaration in the
  MyEditCtlAppCtl.h file to overload the OnMouseActivate virtual function:

        virtual int OnMouseActivate(CWnd* pDesktopWnd, UINT nHitTest, UINT);

3. Add the following line to the MessageMap (within BEGIN_MESSAGE_MAP and
  END_MESSAGE_MAP pair) in MyEditCtlAppCtl.cpp file:

        ON_WM_MOUSEACTIVATE()

4. Add the following lines to the MyEditCtlAppCtl.cpp file to implement the
  OnMouseActivate function:

        int CMyEditCtlAppCtrl::OnMouseActivate(CWnd* pDesktopWnd,
                 UINT nHitTest, UINT message)
        {
           OnActivateInPlace (TRUE, NULL); //UI-Activate the control
           return COleControl::OnMouseActivate(pDesktopWnd,
                      nHitTest, message);
        }

5. Rebuild the project and run the Visual Basic test project. This time,
  everything works as expected.

Steps to Fix the Problem in Visual Basic
----------------------------------------

1. Open the Visual Basic test project with the old MFC control.

2. Add the following code to the form's code window where MyEditCtlApp2 can be
  replaced with any MyEditCtlApp control placed on Tab control:

        Private Sub SSTab1_Click(PreviousTab As Integer)
           MyEditCtlApp2.SetFocus
        End Sub

3. Run the application and note that everything works as expected.
