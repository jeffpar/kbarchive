The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use a Greeting Card template in Microsoft Creative Writer,
you may receive the following message when you click one of the available
templates:

  Creative Writer couldn't open a piece of art work.

  If you're just starting Creative Writer, or trying to play a video:

  Check to make sure the Creative Writer CD is in the CD-ROM drive.

  If you're trying to paste some art or music:

  Make sure the CD is in the CD-ROM drive.

  If you were pasting something that you added to an art or music collection,
  make sure the file is still on your computer and hasn't been moved to a
  different folder.

  You can delete "lost" files (that you added) - just click the item in the
  collection, and press the Delete key.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if your computer is using real mode (16-bit) drivers to
access your CD-ROM drive, or if the CD-ROM drive is operating in MS-DOS
Compatibility mode.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, verify that you are using protected mode (32-bit) CD-ROM
drivers. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. Click the Performance tab.

4. Verify that the File System entry is 32-bit. If the File System entry is
  "Some drives are using MS-DOS compatibility," you may be using real mode
  (16-bit) CD-ROM drivers. Contact the manufacturer of your CD-ROM drive to
  obtain protected mode drivers for your CD-ROM drive.
