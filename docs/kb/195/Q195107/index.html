- Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Pack 1 
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5

SYMPTOMS
========


When a new contact is created in Outlook Web Access (OWA) and only the first name
is entered for the contact, on viewing the contacts using Outlook, the entry
will be preceded by a comma. For example, ", John".

To understand the behavioral difference, note that the entry is markedly
different if the contact was created in Outlook. In this case, the contact will
appear as expected - without the unnecessary comma separator. For example,
"John".

CAUSE
=====

The problem was traced to a bug in OWA parsing whereby it would put a comma even
when the last name is a blank.

STATUS
======

Microsoft recognizes the need for the removal of this extra separator. We have
modified OWA component so that it does not add this extra separator when the
last name is a blank.

This supported feature is now available, but has not been fully regression tested
and should be applied only to systems having a specific need for it. Unless you
are severely impacted by the lack of this feature, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next service pack that contains this feature. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
