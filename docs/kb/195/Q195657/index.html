SYMPTOMS
========

Type conversion functions, such as CInt, may sometimes return unexpected
results. For example, CInt(2.5) should return 2 according to the documentation.
However, CInt(25.0 * 0.1) will sometimes result in 3.

CAUSE
=====

This is caused by the way floating point values are handled in computers.
Because most floating point values cannot be accurately represented with fixed
length binary values, the internal result of the floating point calculation may
differ slightly. For example, 25.0 * 0.1 may be 02.5000... 001 or 02.4999...999
depending on many factors. This rounding error causes the CInt function to
return 2 or 3 in different situations.

RESOLUTION
==========

This is expected behavior and there is no fix for this. However, you can make
these functions return the expected values more often by using wrapping
functions. For example, you can use the following function instead of using
CInt:

     Private Function MyCInt(ByVal dTemp As Double) As Integer
        MyCInt = CInt(dTemp)
     End Function

This works by forcing the expression to be evaluated and stored into an
intermediate variable. This forces rounding, which often discards the small
difference between the correct value and the real value in the computer. This
method can also be used for CLng, etc.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add two CommandButtons to Form1 and keep the default names, Command1 and
  Command2.

3. Add the following code to the code window of Form1:

        Option Explicit

        Private Function MyCInt(Byval dTemp As Double) As Integer
           MyCInt = CInt(dTemp)
        End Function

        Private Sub Command1_Click()
           Dim t As Single, s As Single
           Dim z As Integer, h As Integer
           Dim Msg As String

           Msg = "Using CInt for these calculations:" &amp; vbCrLf
           t = 25#
           s = t * 0.1
           Msg = Msg &amp; "The result of 25.0 * 0.1 = " &amp; s &amp; vbCrLf

           h = CInt(s)
           Msg = Msg &amp; "Where t = 25#, and s = t * 0.1, the result of " _
           &amp; "CInt(t * 0.1) = " &amp; h &amp; vbCrLf

           z = CInt(t * 0.1)
           Msg = Msg &amp; "And the result of CInt(t * 0.1) = " &amp; z

           MsgBox Msg
        End Sub

        Private Sub Command2_Click()
           Dim t As Single, s As Single
           Dim z As Integer, h As Integer
           Dim Msg As String

           Msg = "Using MyCInt for these calculations:" &amp; vbCrLf
           t = 25#
           s = t * 0.1
           Msg = Msg &amp; "The result of 25.0 * 0.1 = " &amp; s &amp; vbCrLf

           h = MyCInt(s)
           Msg = Msg &amp; "Where t = 25#, and s = t * 0.1, the result of " _
           &amp; "MyCInt(t * 0.1) = " &amp; h &amp; vbCrLf

           z = MyCInt(t * 0.1)
           Msg = Msg &amp; "And the result of MyCInt(t * 0.1) = " &amp; z

           MsgBox Msg
        End Sub

4. Press the F5 key to run the application. Click Command1 and the result of
  CInt(2.5 * 0.1) is 3 (incorrect). Click Command2 and the result of MyCInt(2.5
  * 0.1) is 2 (correct).
