The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to merge a range of records from your data source, the following
error message may appear:

  Word could not merge the main document with the data source because the data
  records were empty or no data records matched your query options.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur when the query condition you are trying to set in the
query options does not match your data source.


WORKAROUND
==========

Use one of the following methods appropriate for your situation.

Method 1: Correct Your Query Options
------------------------------------

Edit your data source and make sure that the "Compare to" of your query options
matches exactly the data contained in your data source. For example, if you are
trying to set a query option to filter the FirstName field to match a particular
first name, make sure that the name is contained in the FirstName column of your
data source.

NOTE: The FirstName field value must match EXACTLY the value you typed in the
"Compare to" field of your query option (query option values are case
sensitive).

Method 2: Reattach Your Data Source
-----------------------------------

When you attach and save a data source to a mail merge main document, Word
"remembers" which data source is attached by saving the attached file's path and
file name in the main document. Word also remembers the query options that may
have been previously set.

Use the following steps to reattach your mail merge main document to your data
source:

1. Open your mail merge main document.

2. On the Tools menu, click Mail Merge.

3. In the Mail Merge Helper, click Create and then click "Restore to Normal Word
  document".

  NOTE: At this point, your mail merge main document does not have a data source
  attached. Therefore, all information pertaining to the data source link and
  query options will be lost.

4. Click Create and then click the type of main document you had previously set
  for your mail merge main document.

  NOTE: When Word prompts you to use either the active document or a new
  document, click Active Document.

5. Click Get Data, attach your data source to your mail merge main document, and
  then try setting your query options, if needed.


To work around this problem, instead of merging to a new document or to the
printer with query options set, follow these steps:

1. In your main document, click View Merged Data on the Mail Merge toolbar.

2. Click Next Record to find the correct record you want.

  NOTE: You see one record at a time, and the information will populate your
  main document.

3. On the File menu, click Print.

4. Repeat steps 2-3 for each record that you want to merge.

MORE INFORMATION
================

As an example of the error message, if you have the following records in your
data file

Record_Number    First_Name     Last_Name
-----------------------------------------

        1          Erin           O'Melia
        2          Lani           Ota
        3          Suanne         Nagata
        4          Jeff           Smith

and you instruct Word to merge records 2 through 4, and you set the query options
to filter those records in which First_Name is equal to Smith, Word displays the
error message.

For information about using the Query Options feature, click Microsoft Word Help
Topics on the Help menu. On the Find tab, type "query" (without the quotation
marks). Select the "Select data records from a data source" topic.
