SUMMARY
=======

Fix2lBar.exe is a sample that show how to correct CToolBar's behavior. The
original CToolBar, relying only on early releases of the common controls, does
not behave intuitively whenever it contains two or more consecutive separators
and it has vertical orientation. This behavior is even more striking when the
toolbar has the new TBSTYLE_FLAT style.

This sample provides a CToolBar-derived class that takes advantage of the new
common controls features, in particular, of the CCS_VERT style, now available
for control bars. Building on the new features of the toolbar control, the new
class overrides the necessary functions to provide the correct behavior. The
class requires ComCtl32.DLL versions 4.72 or greater.

  FixToolBar.h,      The new CFixToolBar class that overrides

  FixTBar.dsp        The project file.
  FixTBar.h          The main header file for the application.
  FixTBar.cpp        The main application source file (CFixTBarApp).
  FixTBar.rc         Listing of all Windows resources used.

  MainFrm.cpp        Contain the frame class CMainFrame.
  res\Toolbar.bmp    Used to create tiled images for the toolbar.
  FixTBarDoc.h,

  FixTBarView.h
  FixTBarView.cpp    The view of the document CFixTBarView class.
  StdAfx.h
  StdAfx.cpp         Used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file.
  Resource.h         Defines new resource IDs.

The sample contains an AppWizard-generated SDI application, and implements a
CToolBar-derived class that implements the necessary fixes. The solution relies
basically on adding the new style CCS_VERT to the toolbar when it must display
more than just one row of buttons. In addition, the CalcSize() and WrapToolBar()
functions must be overridden. However, because these two functions are not
virtual, all CToolBar members that call these two functions need to be copied
and pasted in the new class, up to and including the virtual functions
CalcFixedLayout() and CalcDynamicLayout().

To illustrate the problem, the resource file has been edited to define the
toolbar as:

     IDR_MAINFRAME TOOLBAR DISCARDABLE  16, 15
     BEGIN
         BUTTON      ID_FILE_NEW
         BUTTON      ID_FILE_OPEN
         BUTTON      ID_FILE_SAVE
             SEPARATOR
             SEPARATOR
         BUTTON      ID_EDIT_CUT
         BUTTON      ID_EDIT_COPY
         BUTTON      ID_EDIT_PASTE
             SEPARATOR
         BUTTON      ID_FILE_PRINT
             SEPARATOR
         BUTTON      ID_APP_ABOUT
     END

You can experiment with both flat style toolbars and old style toolbars. To do
this, comment in and out the corresponding toolbar creation code in
CMainFrame::OnCreate().

NOTE: To use this fix on a Visual C++ 5.0 system, you need to add the two files,
FixToolBar.h and FixToolBar.cpp, to a Visual C++ 5.0-generated project. Make
sure you have the new common controls dll; add the corresponding new header
(Commctrl.h and Commctrl.rh in DevStudio\VC\include directory) and lib files
(Comctl32.lib in DevStudio\VC\lib) to your Visual C++ 5.0 installation.
