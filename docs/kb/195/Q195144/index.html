The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

When files are copied from a source having a mixture of short filenames and long
filenames, the copy operation may lead to lost files.

This problem can happen when the copy operation is performed using any of the
following programs:

- COPY

- XCOPY

- Windows NT Explorer

- Windows NT Backup

CAUSE
=====

This problem happens when a file with a long filename is copied and a new short
filename is generated for the file in the destination folder. If a file exists
in the source folder and it has a name matching the newly generated short
filename, this file will replace the first file and the content of the first
file is lost. For example:

  Source Directory :

  C:\source&gt; dir /x

  08/21/98  02:03p        &lt;DIR&gt;                          .
  08/21/98  02:03p        &lt;DIR&gt;                          ..
  08/20/98  02:32p                     17                YXXXXX~1.XXX
  08/20/98  02:32p                     7 YXXXXX~2.XXX    yxxxxxxxxx.xxx
    4 File(s)              14 bytes

  C:\source&gt; copy *.* c:\dest
  yxxxxxxxxx.xxx
  YXXXXX~1.XXX
       2 file(s) copied.

  C:\source&gt; dir c:\dest

  09/15/98  09:27a        &lt;DIR&gt;                          .
  09/15/98  09:27a        &lt;DIR&gt;                          ..
  08/20/98  02:32p                     17 YXXXXX~1.XXX   yxxxxxxxxx.xxx
    3 File(s)             17 bytes

NOTE: The File yxxxxxxxxx.xxx gets copied first and the short filename generated
for that is YXXXXX~1.XXX. When the copy program copies YXXXXX~1.XXX to the
destination, it finds a match in file name and replaces the existing file with
its contents.

In NTBackup, if both the short named file, and the NTFS converted long file names
are the same, you are prompted whether to replace the existing file or not.
Overwriting the file may result in data loss as the file names will be the same
but the contents will not be.

NOTE: The fixes mentioned above only fixes Windows NT Explorer initiated copies.
The COPY/XCOPY behaviour is unchanged by design.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can work around this problem by using the Windows NT Resource Kit utility,
Robocopy, to copy the files.

Windows NT Backup
-----------------

If the short file named files (for example, Drawg~12.dwg) are created by legacy
applications and these applications cannot be upgraded, the following methods
can be employed:

- Use the FAT formatted partitions on Windows NT Servers for compatibility with
  these applications and use share-level security.

The following are less optimum workarounds but are mentioned here for
convenience.

- Disable the auto-generation of the short file names on NTFS volumes as per
  the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q210638 How to Disable Automatic Short File Name Generation

- Use different directories for long and short named files.
