SUMMARY
=======

WordStar versions 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, and 7.0 share the same file format; however,
with each new version, additional features were added to the format. WordStar
4.0 has a different file format from WordStar 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, and 7.0.

Microsoft Word 97 supports WordStar 3.3, 3.5, 4.0, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, and 7.0 file
formats. Word versions 7.0 and later also support importing WordStar 1.0 and 2.0
for Windows documents.
