SUMMARY
=======

The Internet Mail Connector (IMC) Configuration Extractor (Imcsave.exe) is a
command-line tool that extracts IMC messages and configurations from the
Microsoft Exchange Server information store and directory. These messages and
configurations can then be restored on another computer.

This tool allows Microsoft Product Support Services to collect information for
troubleshooting, and to set up a matching configuration to reproduce problems.
Use the IMC Configuration Extractor only with the assistance of Microsoft
Product Support Services.

A copy of the Imcsave utility can be found only on the BackOffice Resource Kit
1.0 Part 1 or Part 2 CD.

Starting with the release of Exchange Server 5.0 the Imcsave utility is available
with the product. It can be found on Exchange Server 5.x CDs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The IMC Configuration Extractor does not require special installation and can be
run from your directory.

The IMC Configuration Extractor performs the following operations for collecting
data and extracting IMC messages:

- Looks in the registry to find the location of the Imcdata directory, then
  creates a directory called Backup under the Imcdata directory. If the
  directory already exists, the process quits.

- Copies all IMC service registry values to a file called Imcsvc.reg.

- Copies all IMC profile registry values to a file called Imcpro.reg.

- Uses DAPI to export the gateway object to a file called Imcobj.csv.

- Logs on to the service in the same manner as the Internet Mail Connector
  does.

- Immediately sets a flag in the information store, which prevents more mail
  from being routed through the Internet Mail Connector.

- Creates a directory called Imcdata\Backup\Mtsout, and copies all messages
  from MTS-OUT into it using the transport-neutral encapsulation format (TNEF).

- Creates a directory called Imcdata\Backup\Mtsin, and copies all messages from
  MTS-IN into it.

- Generates a packing list of all generated files called Imcfls, using the
  format of an .ini file to encode the information.

  USAGE: IMCSAVE [-output SaveDir] [-save Item [Item]...] [-delete]

   -output SaveDir       Save all output under the specified directory
                         (SaveDir) in a subdirectory named Backup.
                         If not specified, output will be stored under the
                         IMC root directory in a subdirectory named
                         Backup.

   -save Item [Item]...  Save the specified output Items.

   Items include:

       Reg[istry]                - IMC Registry data
       Dir[ectory]               - IMC Directory Service data
       MTSI[n]                   - MTS-IN message queue
       MTSO[ut]                  - MTS-OUT message queue
       Bad                       - Bad message queue
       Con[tentConversionFailed] - ContentConversionFailed message queue
       Work                      - Work message queue

                         If -save is not specified, all Items are saved.

   -delete               Delete messages in the queues.
                         A confirmation dialog is conducted, and messages
                         are only deleted if they are successfully saved
                         in TNEF files.
