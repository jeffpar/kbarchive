-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Motocross Madness, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Microsoft Motocross Madness, the game may attempt to read from any
CD-ROM drives, floppy drives, and other removable media drives installed in the
computer when the following screens are displayed:

- The initial loading screen
- The Garage screen
- The Options screen

This behavior can delay the game until Motocross Madness is finished attempting
to read from these drives.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because Motocross Madness searches for game files on all
of the floppy disk drives, hard disks, and removable media drives installed in
or connected to the computer. This process can take a long time if no game files
are present on any of these devices. The process can take even more time if no
valid media are inserted in any of the removable media or floppy disk drives.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, insert the Motocross Madness CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive
when you play the game.

If the issue continues to occur, insert a formatted disk in each removable media
drive.
