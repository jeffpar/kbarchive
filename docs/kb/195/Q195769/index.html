The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The following events are logged in the Windows NT Application Event Log after
disconnecting a 5250 display session in the 5250 Applet included with SNA
Server:

Event ID: 92
  Source: SNA APPC Application
  Description: APPC TP detected abend of SNA subsystem

  Event ID: 38
  Source: SNA Server
  Description: APPC session deactivated abnormally

     Qualifier = 0005
     Connection = &lt;connection name&gt;
     LU alias = &lt;Local APPC LU Alias&gt;
     PLU alias = &lt;Remote APPC LU Alias&gt;
     Mode name = QPCSUPP
     Session ID = &lt;session ID&gt;
     LFSID = &lt;LFSID&gt;
     Client Domain = &lt;client's domain&gt;
     Client User = &lt;User ID&gt;
     Client Machine = &lt;TCP/IP Address/NetBIOS name&gt;

These events are logged even though the 5250 display session is properly
disconnected using the Session Disconnect option.

NOTE: Although this has only been observed with SNA Server's 5250 Applet, it
could occur with any APPC application that calls the TEST_RTS_AND_POST verb to
detect direction change for the conversation being used.

CAUSE
=====

The 5250 Applet included with SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 2 was modified to use
the APPC TEST_RTS_AND_POST verb to detect change of direction for its APPC
conversation. This was done as a performance enhancement. After this change was
made, disconnecting a 5250 session in the 5250 Applet causes the
TEST_RTS_AND_POST verb to be cancelled. The mechanism used to cancel this
outstanding verb causes the Event 92 and 38 to be logged.


RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 SP2, 3.0
SP3, 4.0, and 4.0 SP1. We are researching this problem in SNA Server version 3.0
and will post more information here in the Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.

This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

In this case, the event 38 and 92 messages are benign and do not indicate a
problem. However, these events may be logged for other reasons that do indicate
a problem. The following is a more detailed explanation of the Event 38
Qualifier 0005 event:

SNA Server sent an UNBIND(Cleanup) message on this session to the remote system
in order to clean up the session.

CAUSE: This problem can be caused by any one of the following:

- The SNA Server client computer (where the 5250 emulator or APPC/CPIC
  application is running) has lost its network session to the SNA Server.

- The 5250 emulator or APPC/CPIC application issued a TP_ENDED(HARD) to cause
  the LU6.2 session to be ended.

- The 5250 emulator or APPC/CPIC application failed abnormally or was ended by
  the user while in the middle of a conversation.

ACTION:
If a 5250 user is losing their emulation session unexpectedly (because of the
client's network session being lost to the SNA Server), capture SNA Server
client internal trace, a LU6.2 message trace, and an APPC API trace of the
problem, along with a matching sniffer or Network Monitor trace showing the lost
network session, and provide them to Microsoft support personnel.
