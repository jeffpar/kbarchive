-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Incorrect default permissions are assigned when creating a unique Terminal
Server home directory for multiple users using the following form:

  \\server\share\%username%

CAUSE
=====

User Manager (Musrmgr.exe) is the default account manager for all member servers
and workstations at installation time. User Manager for Domains (Usrmgr.exe) is
the default for all domain controllers at installation time. Usrmgr.exe is
copied to all member servers and workstations when they join a domain to give
administrators the same capability from any Windows NT system. Both versions
allow the administrator to select multiple objects (users or groups) at one time
and make various property changes that apply to those selected.

When running Windows Terminal Server, the Profile configuration dialog box in
both versions of the utility allows the administrator to configure the home
directory for Terminal Server users. When specifying the path, the variable
%USERNAME% can be used to indicate the user name currently being processed. This
is useful when selecting multiple users and each user must have his or her own
home directory. If multiple users are selected and %USERNAME% is used, the
default permissions assigned are incorrect when running Musrmgr.exe and the
local path is selected or when running Usrmgr.exe and a remote path is
selected.

The default permissions are applied as:

  Everyone - Full Control/Full Control
  System - Full Control/Full Control

The default permissions should be:

  Administrator - Special Access (All) (Not Specified)
  SYSTEM - Full Control (All) (All)
  UserName - Full Control (All) (All)

NOTE: When running Musrmgr.exe on a member server and a remote path is selected,
the permissions applied should match the first set of permissions above.
