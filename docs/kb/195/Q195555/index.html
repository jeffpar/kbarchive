SUMMARY
=======

If you are unable to start one of the Microsoft programs listed at the beginning
of this article, or if you experience problems when you attempt to use the
enhanced sound or display features in one of the Microsoft programs listed at
the beginning of this article, you may need to obtain updated drivers for your
sound card or display adapter.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The installation CD-ROMs for the Microsoft programs listed at the beginning of
this article each contain a set of registry keys you can use to determine if any
problems that occur when you use Bookshelf 99 are related to outdated sound card
or display adapter drivers.

To use these registry keys to troubleshoot problems in Bookshelf:

1. Insert the installation CD-ROM for the program into your CD-ROM drive. Press
  and hold down the SHIFT key when you insert the CD-ROM to prevent the program
  from starting automatically.

2. Click Start, and then click Run.

3. In the Open box, type the following line, and then click OK

  &lt;cd-rom&gt;:\support\regfiles

  where &lt;cd-rom&gt; is the drive letter for the CD-ROM drive.

4. Double-click the Bssndoff.reg file, and then click OK.

5. Start Bookshelf.

6. If the issue is resolved, contact the manufacturer of your sound card to
  inquire about how to obtain and install an updated sound driver for your
  sound card.

  If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next step.

7. Quit Bookshelf.

8. In the Regfiles window, double-click the Bssndon.reg file, and then click OK.

9. Double-click the Bsvwoff.reg file, and then click OK.

10. Start Bookshelf.

11. If the issue is resolved, contact the manufacturer of your video adapter to
  inquire about how to obtain and install an updated video driver for your
  video adapter.

  If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next step.

12. Quit Bookshelf.

13. In the Regfiles window, double-click the Bssndoff.reg file, and then click
  OK.

14. Start Bookshelf.

15. If the issue is resolved, contact the manufacturer of your sound card and
  the manufacturer of your display adapter to inquire about how to obtain and
  install updated drivers for your sound card and your video adapter.

  If the issue continues to occur, it is probably unrelated to your sound or
  video drivers.

16. Close the Regfiles window.

To restore the startup sounds, the user interface sounds, and the enhanced
display options in Bookshelf, follow these steps:

1. Insert the installation CD-ROM for the program into your CD-ROM drive. Press
  and hold down the SHIFT key when you insert the CD-ROM to prevent the program
  from starting automatically.

2. Click Start, and then click Run.

3. In the Open box, type the following line, and then click OK

  &lt;cd-rom&gt;:\support\regfiles

  where &lt;cd-rom&gt; is the drive letter for the CD-ROM drive.

4. Double-click the Bssndon.reg file, and then click OK.

5. Double-click the Bsvwon.reg file, and then click OK.

6. Close the Regfiles window.
