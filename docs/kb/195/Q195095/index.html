-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Clip Gallery 3.0 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Microsoft Clip Gallery 3.0 across a network, you may receive an
error message similar to the following:

  Clip Gallery cannot open the previews file
  \\&lt;filepath&gt;\&lt;filename.CAG&gt; That file is on a network. The file
  may have been removed or the network server may not be available. Attempting
  to open that file causes Clip Gallery to open slowly.

This error message may repeat a number of times. After clicking OK, Clip Gallery
will open, but there will be very few clips in the Clip Gallery.


CAUSE
=====

This error is caused when all of the following conditions are true:

- Two or more workstations, in a networking environment, attempt to access Clip
  Gallery simultaneously.

- The Clip Gallery Package (CAG) files are stored on a shared network server.

- At least one user is logged in as administrator, or has full permission to
  the shared folder when the Artgalry.cag file is located.

This error may also be caused by other conditions.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, you must set the share permissions for the Office 97
Administrative install folder to read-only for all users and groups that have
access. Typically there is never going to be a reason for an administrator, or
anyone else to have full permissions to this folder.

WORKAROUND
==========


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Clip Gallery (CAG) files store indexes and preview images for pictures in
the Microsoft Clip Gallery. Because this file can be modified (add, and delete
clips), Clip Gallery will attempt to open the CAG files for Read/Write
permissions. When Clip Gallery is successful at opening these files for
Read/Write permissions, it Locks the files, and does not allow any other access
until Clip Gallery is closed. In a shared networking environment, if User1, who
is a network administrator, or someone in a group or policy that is allowed full
or read/write/change permissions, runs Clip Gallery, the CAG files will be
accessed with Read/Write access and Locked from use by all other users
attempting to run Clip Gallery. If User2 or any other user attempts to run Clip
Gallery while User1 is still running Clip Gallery, User2 and all other users who
attempt to run Clip Gallery will receive the error. This will continue to be the
case until User1 closes Clip Gallery.
