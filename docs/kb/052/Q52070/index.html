SUMMARY
=======

This program demonstrates how to use the PMT and PPMT financial functions. PMT
returns the periodic payment for an investment. In the case of a loan, PMT
returns the amount of the constant monthly payment (the sum of principal plus
interest) for the loan, based upon a constant interest rate, the total number of
payments, and the amount (present value) of the loan.

PPMT is the payment on the principal for an investment at a specified period.
(PMT minus PPMT is the payment on the interest at a specified period.) The sum
of all PPMT values returned over the life of the loan equals the loan amount.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Listed below is an analysis of the finances for buying and selling a house. The
program returns average equity gain per month after the house has been bought
and sold. You can change the initial parameters (such as houseval, down, rate1,
sellper, apprec, etc.) to explore different scenarios, including a simplified
inflation effect. Negative net equity gain per month is outgoing money; positive
net equity gain per month is income.

You can choose the period of time at which you sell the house and compare the net
income or outgo per month to that of your current housing situation.

Code Example
------------

  ' To try this example in VBDOS.EXE:
  ' 1. From the File menu, choose New Project.
  ' 2. Copy the code example to the Code window.
  ' 3. Press F5 to run the program.

  ' To run this program in the environment, you must invoke the
  ' environment with the /L switch to load the default Quick library:
  '    VBDOS.EXE /L FINANCE.QLB         for Visual Basic 1.0 for MS-DOS
  '    QBX /L FINANCER.QLB              for Basic PDS 7.0 for MS-DOS
  ' To run outside the QBX.EXE environment, you must link with the
  ' appropriate library (FINANCER.LIB, FINANCAR.LIB, FINANCEP.LIB, or
  ' FINANCAP.LIB).
