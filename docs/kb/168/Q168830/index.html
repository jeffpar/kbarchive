SUMMARY
=======

When using an object that has multiple interfaces, you may be faced with
assigning it to multiple variables of different object types to get at relevant
interfaces. This is made more difficult by having to keep track of the different
variables and clean them up properly. This article gives code for a simple
function to allow casting an object to a different interface without the need to
create additional object variables or keep track of them.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The sample code below illustrates a common problem when utilizing objects that
have multiple interfaces:

     Dim Shape As IShape, C As ICircle, S As ISquare
     Set C = New ICircle
     Set Shape = C
     Shape.SetXY 100, 100
     C.Radius = 50
     Shape.Draw Me
     Set C = Nothing
     Set S = New ISquare
     Set Shape = S            ' Critical line
     Shape.SetXY 300, 200
     S.Side = 50
     Shape.Draw Me
     Set Shape = Nothing
     Set S = Nothing

If you forget to set the Shape object to S on the "Critical line," you will still
be manipulating the Circle object in subsequent code. In addition, it's
difficult to tell you are using the Shape object to get at additional interfaces
or what object it's currently set to.

To clear up this problem, create global functions in your application to cast the
variables to their alternate interfaces. The example above requires only one
function to cast to the IShape interface:

     Function IShape(oShape As IShape) As IShape
       Set IShape = oShape
     End Function

You can then reference this function to perform the casting:

     IShape(C).SetXY 100, 100
     C.Radius = 50
     IShape(C).Draw Me

Or more efficiently:

     With IShape(C)
       .SetXY 100, 100
       C.Radius = 50
       .Draw Me
     End With

You no longer have to define, set, or otherwise keep track of additional
variables for casting purposes. Giving the function the same name as the
interface helps with program clarity.

Step-by Step Example
--------------------

1. Create a new project with the following objects:

  Type            Name
  ---------------------------
  Class Module    IShape
  Class Module    ICircle
  Class Module    ISquare
  Form            Form1

2. Type the following code in the IShape Class Module:

        Option Explicit

        Public Sub SetXY(ByVal NewX As Long, ByVal NewY As Long)
        End Sub

        Public Sub Draw(oDrawSpace As Object)
        End Sub

3. Type the following code into the ICircle Class Module:

        Option Explicit
        Implements IShape

        Dim X As Long, Y As Long, iRadius As Long

        Private Sub IShape_Draw(oDrawSpace As Object)
          oDrawSpace.Circle (X, Y), iRadius
        End Sub

        Private Sub IShape_SetXY(ByVal NewX As Long, ByVal NewY As Long)
          X = NewX
          Y = NewY
        End Sub

        Public Property Let Radius(ByVal NewVal As Long)
          iRadius = NewVal
        End Property

4. Type the following code in the ISquare Class Module:

        Option Explicit
        Implements IShape

        Dim X As Long, Y As Long, Side As Long

        Private Sub IShape_Draw(oDrawSpace As Object)
          oDrawSpace.Line (X, Y)-(X + Side, Y + Side), , B
        End Sub

        Private Sub IShape_SetXY(ByVal NewX As Long, ByVal NewY As Long)
          X = NewX
          Y = NewY
        End Sub

        Public Property Let SideLength(ByVal NewVal As Long)
          Side = NewVal
        End Property

5. Add a CommandButton to the lower edge of the form.

6. Type the following code in the form module:

        Option Explicit

        Private Sub Command1_Click()

        Dim C As ICircle, S As ISquare
          Set C = New ICircle
          Set S = New ISquare
        ' Manipulate circle shape (using With)
          C.Radius = 250
          With IShape(C)
            .SetXY 400, 400
            .Draw Me
          End With
        ' Manipulate square shape (without using With)
          IShape(S).SetXY 700, 300
          S.SideLength = 300
          IShape(S).Draw Me
        End Sub

        Function IShape(oShape As IShape) As IShape
          Set IShape = oShape
        End Function

7. Run the project and click the CommandButton. You will see a circle and a
  square drawn on the form background.
