-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
- the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When associating a new file type with Microsoft Word, files of that type open in
Word 7.0 instead of opening in Word 97.

CAUSE
=====

The problem above occurs if the following conditions are true:

- You have associated the file type you are trying to open with Word.

  -and-

- Both Word 7.0 and Word 97 are installed on the computer.

  -and-

- You are opening the file from the Windows Explorer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post more
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

WORKAROUND
==========

Associating the file type with Microsoft Word 97 will cause the file to open in
the correct version of Microsoft Word. Follow the steps below to re-associate
the files.

1. In the Windows Explorer, Click View on the menu and then click Options. The
  Options dialog will appear.

2. Click the File Types tab. Highlight the file type you are trying to open from
  the Registered Files Type list box. Click the Edit button. The Edit File Type
  dialog box will appear.

3. Highlight Open from the Actions list box. Click Edit. In the Editing Action
  For Type dialog box, click the Browse button. The Open With dialog box
  appears

4. Search for and highlight the Microsoft Office 97 executable file. That file
  in normally located in the C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office folder.
  Click the Open and then click OK. Click Close twice.

When you now open that particular file type, it will open in Microsoft Word 97
instead of Microsoft Word 7.0. This process must be repeated for each new file
type you wish to open into Microsoft Word 97.
