The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the StartConversionWizard supplied with Microsoft Word, you may
receive one of the following error messages:

  Word cannot complete the conversion of this file--&lt;filename&gt;. Would you
  like to continue with the batch conversion?

  -or-

  Converter Error

When you click OK, you receive the following error message:

  Word cannot complete the conversion of this file--&lt;filename&gt;. Would you
  like to continue with the batch conversion?

When you click Yes, the same error message is repeated four times. On the third
and fourth occurrence of this message, the file name extension (for example,
.doc) does not appear in the error message.

CAUSE
=====

Case 1: File Name and/or Folder Name Exceeds 255 Characters
-----------------------------------------------------------

If a file name or folder name exceeds 255 characters, you receive the following
error message:

  Word cannot complete the conversion of this file--&lt;filename&gt;. Would you
  like to continue with the batch conversion?

This error message appears once for each file that matches this description.

Case 2: Same Format Converting From and To
------------------------------------------

This error message appears if the format of the document that is selected for
conversion is the same as the format you are converting to.

For example, this problem occurs under the following conditions:

- You are converting from WordPerfect 5.1 to Word 97.

  -and-

- A Word 97 file exists in the batch of files that you selected for conversion.

You receive the error message when the Batch Conversion Wizard attempts to
convert the Word 97 document to Word 97 format.

Case 3: Insufficient Disk Space
-------------------------------

This problem may occur when the StartConversionWizard source folder is set to a
drive that has insufficient disk space, regardless of whether the destination
folder is set to a different drive that has plenty of available disk space.

When there is insufficient disk space available on the drive that contains the
source folder, Microsoft Word cannot create temporary files; therefore, Word
cannot complete the conversion of any of the remaining files.

Case 4: Files with Numeric Names
--------------------------------

Sometimes this message is followed by the same error message again once or even
twice, but instead of the file name extension appearing in the error message,
the extension specified in the error message is two periods (..).

Word randomly saves some, but not all, of the files, after they have been
converted. For example, if six files are chosen for conversion, Word may only
save one, two, or three of the files or none at all after the Conversion Wizard
is finished with the conversion process. The unsaved files remain open on the
screen in Word and can be saved manually.

This problem occurs if the file names of the files that are being converted begin
with a numeric character, as in the following examples:

  03604.doc
  1212.01
  444.555
  1.doc
  0003.xx

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the method appropriate for the type of problem
you are having.

Case 1: File Name and/or Folder Name Exceeds 255 Characters
-----------------------------------------------------------

Rename your file or folder to be fewer than 255 characters.

NOTE: Because there are several versions of Windows, the following steps may be
different on your computer. If they are, please consult your product
documentation to complete these steps.

To change the name of a file or folder, follow these steps:

1. If you are renaming a file, close the file in any program that may have it
  open.

2. In My Computer or Windows Explorer, click to select the file or folder that
  you want to rename. Do not open it.

3. On the File menu, click Rename.

4. Type the new name, and then press ENTER.

NOTE: A file name can cannot contain any of the following characters:

  \ / : * ? " &lt; &gt; |

Case 2: Same Format Converting From and To
------------------------------------------

Method 1: Select Documents with Format Other Than the "Convert To" Format:

In the File Selection area of the Batch Conversion Wizard dialog box, do not
select documents for conversion whose file type matches the conversion type. For
example, if you are converting from WordPerfect 5.1 to Word 97 document format,
do not select a Word 97 document for conversion to Word 97 format.

Method 2: Move Documents of Same File Type to Another Location:

Move the documents that have the same file format as the "convert to" type to a
different directory or folder before you run the Batch Conversion Wizard. For
example, if you are converting documents to Word 97, move any Word 97 documents
out of the folder before you run the conversion macro.

Method 3: Run the Batch Conversion and Ignore the Error Message:

All files whose format differs from the format that you are converting to will be
converted correctly.

Case 3: Insufficient Disk Space
-------------------------------

Make sure there is enough disk space available on the drive where the source
folder is located. Or, move the files that need to be converted to another drive
that has more available disk space. The amount of space that is needed depends
on the number and size of the files that you are converting.

Case 4: Files with Numeric Names
--------------------------------

Rename the documents with alphabetical characters for file names instead of
numeric characters. The file extension can remain numeric.
