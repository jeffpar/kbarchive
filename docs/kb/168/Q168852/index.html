SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a nested U.S. field that is dependent on regional system settings
for parsing the field, the field may generate a syntax error when the field is
updated on a computer with non-U.S. regional system settings.

CAUSE
=====

Some fields rely on certain regional settings. For example, the most common
cause of this problem is if there exists a difference between the decimal symbol
and the digit-grouping symbol.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, either change the regional settings to make the
field work correctly, or edit the field so that it contains the correct
symbols.

To find or change the regional settings, follow these steps:

1. On the Windows taskbar, click Start, point to Settings, and click Control
  Panel.

2. Double-click Regional Settings.

3. Click the Number tab.

The decimal symbol setting and the digit grouping symbol setting are located in
this dialog box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Certain regional settings are used when Microsoft Word 97 attempts to parse the
field during the field update. Examples of these settings are Decimal Symbol and
Digit Grouping Symbol.

Decimal Symbol identifies the character that is used to indicate decimal values.
In the U.S., this symbol is a decimal point, as in the following example:

  12.5 (to indicate twelve and one-half)

Digit Grouping Symbol identifies the character that is used to group the digits
in large numbers. In the U.S., this symbol is a comma, as in the following
example:

  100,000 (one-hundred thousand)

In certain types of nested fields, you receive a syntax error if you move a
document from a computer using U.S. settings to a computer using non- U.S.
settings.

The following field will generate a syntax error if it is created on a computer
using U.S. regional settings and then opened on a computer using non-U.S.
regional settings:

  {=sum{1,2,3} }

On a computer with U.S. regional settings, the comma is used to separate the 1,
2, and 3, indicating that they should be added together. On a computer with
non-U.S. regional settings, such as Brazilian settings, the comma is used as a
decimal symbol, making the field invalid.
