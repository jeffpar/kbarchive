SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 TN3270 Server may fail unexpectedly with an access
violation. If DRWTSN32.EXE is configured as the default Windows NT debugger, an
entry will be logged in the &lt;ntroot&gt;\DRWTSN32.LOG file as follows:

  Application exception occurred:
          App: exe\tn3servr.DBG  &lt;process ID&gt;
          When: &lt;date / time &gt;
          Exception number: c0000005 (access violation)

The following are examples of various routines and stack traces which may be
indicated when this problem occurs (note that all failures indicate a calling
routine of ntdll!RtlFreeHeap):

With the NTSD debugger attached, the stack trace may indicate the following
failure:

CAUSE
=====

This problem was caused after a mismatched version of MSVCRT40.DLL was installed
on the Windows NT machine where the TN3270 Server was running. MSVCRT40.DLL
supports 'C' runtime library functions which may be used and distributed by
third party Windows NT applications developed using Microsoft Visual C++. If a
third party application happens to install MSVCRT40.DLL and replace the version
installed by Windows NT 4.0 (or SNA Server 3.0), this can lead to TN3270 access
violations described above.

The following Microsoft VC++ DLL's are shipped by Windows NT 4.0 (and SNA Server
3.0). The "Base" and "File Version" can be viewed using the "DEPENDS" program,
or by right-clicking on each DLL using the Windows NT 4.0 "My Computer"
program:

  Module        Date      Time     Size      Base        File Version

  MSVCRT.DLL    10/14/96  02:38a   267,536   0x779F0000  4.20.0.6201
  MSVCRT40.DLL  10/14/96  02:38a    65,024   0x779D0000  4.2000.0.6172
  MFC40.DLL     10/14/96  02:38a   924,432   0x762B0000  4.1.0.6139
  MSVCIRT.DLL   10/14/96  02:38a    74,752   0x780A0000  4.20.0.6201

The TN3270 Server access violation was observed when the following MSVCRT40.DLL
was installed on the system by a third party application (with the other DLL's
matching the versions listed above):

  Module        Date      Time     Size      Base        File Version

  MSVCRT40.DLL  9/16/96   07:50a   312,832   0x10200000  4.0.0.5270

RESOLUTION
==========


If an old version of MSVCRT40.DLL is located in the system path, this version
should be renamed and the standard version included with Windows NT 4.0 should
be reapplied. Here is the process to use to resolve this problem:

1. Run the PATH command to check the current system path.

2. Locate all instances of the above DLL's which exist in the system path (note
  that the system path may span several drives).

3. Run the DEPENDS program against these DLL's and check their versions against
  the list documented above (which lists the versions included with Windows NT
  4.0)

4. Rename any "old" versions which may exist on the machine, and apply the
  Windows NT 4.0 versions in their place. If multiple copies of the same DLL
  exists in the system path, rename all duplicate copies and leave a single
  instance in the &lt;ntroot&gt;\system32 directory.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
