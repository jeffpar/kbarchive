SUMMARY
=======

Hooking into a Window (sometimes called sub-classing) is a technique that
enables interception of the messages that are being sent to that Window.
Microsoft Visual Basic allows sub-classing through the use of the AddressOf
operator. This article's purpose is to demonstrate a hooked message stream.

NOTE: It is beyond the scope of this article to describe any particular
application of this technique.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Windows controls applications by sending messages to the windows that
are created by each application. These messages alert the targeted window when
it's time to redraw, when a mouse button is pressed, and all of the other
information a window needs to know in order to act appropriately. Thus, a
minimal Windows application consists of a function for which these messages are
processed (called WindowProc). This function is registered into the system when
the window is created so the system knows where to send messages.

The following application consists of a simple form with two command buttons. The
code is designed to intercept Windows messages being sent to the form and to
print the values of those messages in the Immediate window.

WARNING: Failure to unhook a window before its imminent destruction will result
in application errors, Invalid Page Faults, and data loss. This is due the fact
that the new WindowProc function being pointed to no longer exists, but the
window has not been notified of the change. Always unhook the sub-classed window
upon unloading the sub-classed form or exiting the application. This is
especially important while debugging an application that uses this technique
within the Microsoft Visual Basic Development Environment. Pressing the End
button or selecting End from the Run menu without unhooking will cause an
Invalid Page Fault and close Microsoft Visual Basic.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Start a new Visual Basic Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add two CommandButtons and a Standard Module to the form.

3. Add the following code to the Declarations section of Module1:

        Declare Function CallWindowProc Lib "user32" Alias _
        "CallWindowProcA" (ByVal lpPrevWndFunc As Long, _
        ByVal hwnd As Long, ByVal Msg As Long, _
        ByVal wParam As Long, ByVal lParam As Long) As Long

        Declare Function SetWindowLong Lib "user32" Alias _
        "SetWindowLongA" (ByVal hwnd As Long, _
        ByVal nIndex As Long, ByVal dwNewLong As Long) As Long

        Public Const GWL_WNDPROC = -4
        Public IsHooked As Boolean
        Global lpPrevWndProc As Long
        Global gHW As Long

        Public Sub Hook()
            If IsHooked Then
            MsgBox "Don't hook it twice without " &amp; _
              "unhooking, or you will be unable to unhook it."
            Else
            lpPrevWndProc = SetWindowLong(gHW, GWL_WNDPROC, _
            AddressOf WindowProc)
            IsHooked = True
            End If
        End Sub

        Public Sub Unhook()
            Dim temp As Long
            temp = SetWindowLong(gHW, GWL_WNDPROC,lpPrevWndProc)
            IsHooked = False
        End Sub

        Function WindowProc(ByVal hw As Long, ByVal uMsg As _
        Long, ByVal wParam As Long, ByVal lParam As Long) As Long
            Debug.Print "Message: "; hw, uMsg, wParam, lParam
            WindowProc = CallWindowProc(lpPrevWndProc, hw, _
            uMsg, wParam, lParam)
        End Function

4. Add the following code to the Declarations section of Form1:

        Private Sub Form_Load()
            gHW = Me.hwnd
            Command1.Caption = "Hook"
            Command2.Caption = "Unhook"
        End Sub

        Private Sub Command1_Click()
            Hook
        End Sub

        Private Sub Command2_Click()
            Unhook
        End Sub

        Private Sub Form_QueryUnload(Cancel As Integer, UnloadMode  _
            As Integer)
            If IsHooked Then
            Cancel = 1
            MsgBox "Unhook before closing, or the IDE will crash."
            End If
        End Sub

5. Before running this sample, save your project.

6. Press the F5 key to run the program, and click Hook. The Immediate window
  starts filling with the messages the form is receiving, hooked through to
  your new WindowProc function and then passed on to the Form's own handler.

The Hook and Unhook procedures enable the code to hook into the stream of
messages. In the first procedure (Hook) you make use of the SetWindowLong
function. The SetWindowLong function changes an attribute of a specified window.
It takes the following parameters:

- hwnd: The handle of the Window you are going to change.
- nIndex: The action you are going to do to the window.
- dwNewLong: The new value you change to.

In this example, you use the Form's hwnd property as the targeted window to
change. You then use the GWL_WNDPROC constant to tell the SetWindowLong function
that you want to change the address of the target window's WindowProc function.
Finally you set dwNewLong to the address of a new WindowProc function (see next
step). Notice that you store the previous WindowProc address in the
lpPrevWndProc variable.

The second procedure (UnHook) simply reverses what you have done and puts the
address of the original window procedure back. Here WindowProc is the function
that you are routing the window messages to when you "Hook" the form's
WindowProc function. Note that you make use of the CallWindowProc function;
using the lpPrevWndProc variable to send any unprocessed messages to the
original handler. Hence, you are allowing a chain of window procedures to
process all messages.
