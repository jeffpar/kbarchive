SYMPTOMS
========

When compiling an ActiveX Server (EXE or DLL), you may get the following error
at the end of compiling:

  "An unexpected error occurred during compiling or linking"

If you choose to view the error details, the following message will be
displayed:

  "LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file &lt;filename&gt;"

CAUSE
=====

When the Binary Compatibility property is set for an ActiveX Server component
(.EXE or .DLL), Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0 leaves the compatible source file in
an open state until the Visual Basic 5.0 environment is closed.

NOTE: The behavior can also surface randomly with other types of Visual Basic
projects when Binary Compatibility is used.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are a few workarounds to this behavior:

- When using the Binary Compatibility property, do not set the compatible
  source file to the same filename and location as the compiled component's
  destination file.

-or-

- Use the Project Compatibility option or the No Compatibility option whenever
  possible.

-or-

- Close and re-open the Microsoft Visual Basic environment when it is necessary
  to delete and/or overwrite the file which is locked in the open state.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0's development environment, the user has the option
to select the following compatible component options:

- No Compatibility

- Project Compatibility

- Binary Compatibility

This is done from the Component Tab of the Project Properties Dialog. The set of
options on the dialog box determines how the project is to be compiled. (For
more details on Compatibility, select the Component Tab and then press the Help
button on the dialog.)

Selecting Project Compatibility or Binary Compatibility enables the file location
textbox. The user can then select the source file for the compatibility during
the compile process.

During compilation of the project, Visual Basic opens the compatible source file,
reads specific information, and then writes the compiled compatible file to the
destination specified on the Make Project dialog.

If the user selects Binary Compatibility, Visual Basic does not close the source
file for an ActiveX EXE Server until Visual Basic itself is closed. This is not
the case for the Project Compatibility option, nor is it the case for ActiveX
Control projects.

The result of leaving the file open is not an issue for the user unless the user
selects the same filename and location for the destination file. If they are the
same, the user will encounter an error.
