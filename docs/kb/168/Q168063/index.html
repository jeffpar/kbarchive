-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a document goes through a specific sequence of conversions, extended
characters and LineDraw characters may be converted to incorrect extended
characters or square boxes.

CAUSE
=====

This problem only occurs under the following specific conditions:

Condition 1:
------------

1. Create a document in Microsoft Word for Macintosh version 5.x.

2. Open the document in Microsoft Word 7.0 for Windows.

3. Add smart quotes, em dashes, or LineDraw characters.

4. Save the document in Microsoft Word 7.0 for Windows.

5. Open the document in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.

The characters you typed in step 3, will be incorrectly mapped to other extended
characters or will become square boxes.

Condition 2:
------------

1. Create a document in Microsoft Word for Windows 6.0 or 7.0 configured to use
  an international code page.

2. Open the document in Microsoft Word 7.0 for Windows configured to use a U.S.
  code page.

3. Add smart quotes, em dashes, or LineDraw characters.

4. Save the document in Microsoft Word 7.0 for Windows.

5. Open the document in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows configured to use a U.S.
  code page.

The characters you typed in step 3, will be incorrectly mapped to other extended
characters or will become square boxes.


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 1 (SR- 1).

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods.

Method 1: Search and Replace
----------------------------

Use the search and replace feature to search for the incorrect characters and
replace them with the correct characters by following these steps:

1. Select one of the incorrect characters.

2. On the Edit menu click Copy.

3. On the Edit menu click Replace.

4. Position the insertion point in the Find What box.

5. Press CTRL + V to paste the character into the box.

  It may appear as a square box.

6. In the Replace With box, type the correct character.

7. Click Replace All to replace all instances of the incorrect characters.

8. Repeat these steps for all of the incorrect characters in the document.

Method 2: Save as RTF in the Earlier Version of Word
----------------------------------------------------

After you type the smart quotes, em dashes, or LineDraw characters, save the
document in Rich Text Format (.RTF) by following these steps:

1. On the File menu, click Save As.

2. Change the Save As Type to Rich Text Format (*.RTF).

3. Give the document a new name with an .rtf extension.

4. Save and close the document.

5. Open the document in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.

  The characters should display and print correctly in Microsoft Word 97.

6. Save the document in Word format. On the File menu, click Save As.

7. In the Save As Type box, click "Word Document (*.doc)."

8. Give the document a new name with a .doc extension.
