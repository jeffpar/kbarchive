The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
- Microsoft Word for Windows 95, versions 7.0, 7.0a 
- Microsoft Word for Windows, versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a link to a Microsoft Word 6.x or Microsoft Word 7.x document,
paste it into an MFC (Microsoft Foundation Class) OClient container, and then
double-click the link on a computer that only has Word 97 installed, you may
receive the following message:

  Cannot Start the Source Application For This Object


RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 1 (SR- 1).

To work around this problem, open the container application and the document on
the computer that only has Microsoft Word 97, and reinsert the link to the Word
document.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
This problem was corrected in Microsoft Word 97 SR-1.

For additional information about SR-1, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q172475 OFF97: How to Obtain and Install MS Office 97 SR-1

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem occurs when pasting links to WordPad or any of the Microsoft Office
applications, because WordPad and the Office applications are MFC OClient
containers.

The Microsoft Foundation Class Library, a C++ Windows interface, is built on top
of the C-language Windows application programming interface (API) to ensure
long-term compatibility with the thousands of applications already written for
Windows. MFC is a truly object-oriented interface designed with the following
goals:

- Significantly reduced effort for programming an application for Windows

- Execution speed comparable to that of the C-language API

- Minimum code size overhead

- Ability to call any Windows C functions directly

- Easier conversion of existing C applications to C++

- Ability to leverage from the existing base of C-language Windows programming
  experience

- True Windows API for C++ that effectively uses C++ language features

The core of the Microsoft Foundation Class library encapsulates a large portion
of the Windows API in C++ form. Library classes represent windows, dialog boxes,
device contexts, common GDI objects, and other standard Windows items. These
classes provide a convenient C++ member function interface to the structures in
Windows that they encapsulate. The Microsoft Foundation Class Library also
supplies a layer of additional application functionality built on the C++
encapsulation of the Windows API. This layer is a working application framework
for Windows that provides most of the common user interface expected of programs
for Windows.

The single characteristic that sets the Microsoft Foundation Class Library apart
from other class libraries for Windows is the close mapping to the Windows API
written in the C language. You can generally mix calls to the class library
freely with direct calls to the Windows API. However, the classes are not a
complete replacement for that API. Developers must still occasionally make
direct calls to some Windows functions (::GetSystemMetrics, for example). A
Windows function is wrapped by a class member function only when there is a
clear advantage to doing so.
