The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install a Systems Management Server 1.2 client on a computer running
Windows NT, Systems Management Server does not configure the following as
Microsoft Windows NT services on the client:

- Systems Management Server Remote Control Agent

- Systems Management Server Inventory Agent

- SNMP Event to Trap Translator

CAUSE
=====

If you are running into this problem, the following are some things to Check to
help you troubleshoot and resolve the issue.

There Is No Admin$ Share
------------------------

The Client Configuration Manager service on the Systems Management Server site
server computer connects to the Admin$ share of a client computer running
Windows NT to install the Systems Management Server Remote Control Agent and
Client Inventory Agent services. If this share is not available, these services
will not be installed and the Client Configuration Manager will log the
following error in the Clicfg.log file:

  ERROR: The SMS service account does not have administrative rights on machine
  "&lt;client computer running Windows NT&gt;" for request "YAP00001".

If this is the problem, add the share back, then move the .ccr file from the
Logon.srv\Ccr.box\Retry directory to the Logon.srv\Ccr.box directory. Doing this
forces the Client Configuration Manager service to try processing the .ccr file
again.

Administrator Privileges
------------------------

The Systems Management Server Client Configuration Manager service on the Systems
Management Server site server installs the client services for Win32 computers.
Ensure that the Windows NT Server account used by the Systems Management Server
services has Administrator privileges on the Windows NT client computer.

Under normal circumstances, this will not be a problem. When a Windows NT system
joins a domain, the Domain Admins group for the domain is added to the local
Administrators group of the Windows NT system. If the Windows NT system is a
member of a domain that does not contain the Systems Management Server service
account, this could be the cause of the problem. In this situation, the best
solution is to create a duplicate of the Systems Management Server service
account in the domain and make it a member of the Domain Admins group.

If the Windows NT system is a member of a workgroup, a local account must be
created on the workstation with the same name and password as the Systems
Management Server service account, and it must be a member of the local
Administrators group.

After the account problems are resolved, synchronize the domain and move the .ccr
file from the Logon.srv\Ccr.box\retry directory to the Logon.srv\Ccr.box
directory. Doing this forces the Client Configuration Manager service to try
processing the .ccr file again.

Permissions
-----------

Check the permissions set on the following registry keys on the Systems
Management Server client computer:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Client Services

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\system\currentcontrolset\services

Client Configuration manager tries to add registry entries under these keys.

If the permissions are improperly set, fix the permissions problem, and then move
the .ccr file from the Logon.srv\Ccr.box\retry directory to the
Logon.srv\Ccr.box directory. Doing this forces the Client Configuration Manager
service to try processing the .ccr file again.

NetBIOS Name Resolution
-----------------------

Client Configuration Manager uses the machine name to attempt a remote connection
to the target workstation to install the appropriate client side services. If
there is a problem with name resolution for this client, there will be error 53
occurences in the clicfg.log on the logon server. After solving name resolution
problem(s), move the .ccr file from the Logon.srv\Ccr.box\retry directory to the
Logon.srv\Ccr.box directory. Doing this forces the Client Configuration Manager
service to try processing the .ccr file again.

Wait in Case of Pending .Ccr Files
----------------------------------

If you have many new 32-bit Systems Management Server clients whose logon script
was recently modified to install Systems Management Server, you may see a delay
as the Client Configuration Manager must process all the .ccr files in the
Logon.srv\Ccr.box directory. Check this directory to see if there are many
pending .ccr files waiting to be processed by the Client Configuration Manager
service.

Wait for All the Files to Be Copied Before Restarting the Client
----------------------------------------------------------------

A fairly common mistake when installing the Systems Management Server Client
services is clicking too soon on the "Restart the machine..." dialog box before
the files are completely installed on the client. You may have restarted the
computer as soon as you saw this dialog box, and not waited for the files to be
completely copied, or for the percentage counter to go all the way up to 100
percent.

Use Windows NT 3.51 or Later
----------------------------

The Remote Control Agent service requires Windows NT version 3.51 or later. If
the computer is running an earlier version of the Windows NT operating system,
the Systems Management Server Client Setup will not install this component.

Other Troubleshooting Tips
--------------------------

- Try moving the .ccr file from the Logon.srv\Ccr.box\Retry directory to the
  Logon.srv\Ccr.box directory. Doing this forces the Client Configuration
  Manager service to try processing the .ccr file again. If you have many .ccr
  files in the Logon.srv\Ccr.box\Retry directory, try restarting the Client
  Configuration Manager service on the Systems Management Server site server,
  and it will try to process all the .ccr files in this directory.

- Enable the SNMP registry key. If SNMP is installed after the Systems
  Management Server client services are installed, you may need to manually set
  the TranslatorEnabled value in the
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SNMP_EVENTS\EventLog registry key. This
  value is created by SNMP Setup, and is set to Yes by the CliNT program the
  next time the user logs on or runs the Runsms.bat file. Ensure that this
  value is set to Yes so that the event to SNMP trap translation will occur.

- Check the Clicfg.log file on the client's Systems Management Server logon
  server for any errors.

MORE INFORMATION
================

How Systems Management Server Client Services Are Installed
-----------------------------------------------------------

If any components need to be installed, upgraded or removed, Systems Management
Server Client Setup creates a client configuration request file named
&lt;Sms_id&gt;.ccr, where &lt;Sms_id&gt; is the Systems Management Server Unique
ID for the computer requesting a configuration change. This file is located on
the current Systems Management Server logon server, in the Logon.srv\Ccr.box
directory.

If the Systems Management Server logon server is a server running LAN Manager or
LAN Server, the Maintenance Manager periodically collects the .ccr files from
the Logon.srv\Ccr.box directory of the Systems Management Server logon server,
and moves them to the Logon.srv\Ccr.box directory of the site server.

The Client Configuration Manager is available only on Systems Management Server
logon servers and site servers running Windows NT Server. This means that the
Maintenance Manager must move the .ccr files on servers running LAN Manager and
LAN Server to the site server for processing.

At the Systems Management Server logon server (or the site server if you are
using LAN Manager or LAN Server), the Client Configuration Manager has a CCR
processing thread that waits for and processes .ccr files in the
Logon.srv\Ccr.box directory.

The CCR processing thread reads the .ccr file, connects to the target client
computer's registry, checks whether it has access rights to the computer and its
registry (that is, whether the Systems Management Server service account has
access). It reads the registry and performs the required change to install,
configure, or remove the Systems Management Server client services. It modifies
the appropriate values in the Client Services key to reflect the new
configuration.

If the CCR processing thread completes the configuration requested by a .ccr
file, it deletes the .ccr file. If it cannot complete the configuration
requested by a .ccr file, it performs one of the following actions:

- If a .ccr file for the same target computer already exists in the
  Logon.srv\Ccr.box\Retry directory, the thread updates the .ccr file in the
  Retry directory with the values for the .ccr file in the Ccr.box directory.
  After updating the .ccr file in the Retry directory, the thread deletes the
  .ccr file in the Ccr.box directory

- If a .ccr file for the same target computer does not exist in the Retry
  directory, the thread moves the .ccr file to that directory.

If a configuration change performed by Client Configuration Manager requires the
client computer to be restarted, the Client Monitor program running on the
client displays a message stating that a restart is required to finish the
configuration of the Systems Management Server client components. The user can
choose to restart or not restart.
