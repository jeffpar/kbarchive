- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail, you may
find that messages are stuck in MTS-OUT queue of the connector store. As a
result, messages destined to cc:Mail do not go through, but messages flow fine
from cc:Mail to Exchange Server. In the application log, you receive the
following error message:

  Event ID: 59 Source: MSExchangeCCMC Category: General
  Lotus cc:Mail IMPORT from file *.ccm returned result code 1. Program
  did not complete successfully.

This is a generic error message from the cc:Mail import program. You may notice
there are files in the Exchsrvr\Ccmcdata\Submit directory.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange service account does not have sufficient permission to access the
cc:Mail Post Office database. If the cc:Mail Post Office database is located on
a Novell NetWare server and Microsoft Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW) is not
enabled, you must created service account on the NetWare server with the
identical account information and password. The service account should also has
supervisor equivalent right on the database.

To verify whether the issue is due to permission, you can move the cc:Mail Post
Office database to the Windows NT computer where Exchange Server is running.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

- Grant appropriate trustee right for Exchange Service Account from NetWare.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Inbound mail (from cc:MAIL to Exchange) works fine because Exchange Server only
reads files and writes to Windows NT. But for outbound mail (when Exchange
Server writes to cc:Mail on netWare), the service account does not have
sufficient rights.

cc:Mail is manufactured by Lotus, a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
