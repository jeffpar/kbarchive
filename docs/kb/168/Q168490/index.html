SUMMARY
=======

Running Exchange Server Setup Unattended

You can customize your server installation by running Setup unattended using
customized default settings specified in a Setup.ini file. If you're installing
Microsoft Exchange Server on multiple computers for the first time and want to
use the same configuration on all servers, you can run the Setup program in
unattended batch mode.

Running batch mode Setup is useful if you need to install Microsoft Exchange
Server quickly and don't want to be prompted to enter additional information.
Batch mode Setup (Setup /q) can be used with an .ini file containing
configuration settings so you can install Microsoft Exchange Server without user
input. For example, you can use batch mode Setup to install Microsoft Exchange
Server in offices that don't have full-time administrators who can set up the
servers.

Before you can run batch mode Setup, you must create an .ini file containing
default installation settings. In the .ini file, you can specify preferences,
such as the installation directory, the organization name, and the components,
that will be installed. Using an .ini file is equivalent to selecting options in
dialog boxes during Setup; however, the .ini file provides additional options so
you have more control over your installation.

You can use any text editor to create an .ini file with any name. Several .ini
file examples are included on the Microsoft Exchange Server compact disc in the
Support\Samples\Setup directory. The following example shows the format of the
.ini file.

     [Paths]
     ;Where the server will be installed if selected.
     ServerDest= C:\Exchsrvr

     ;Where Admin will be installed if selected. This entry is optional.
     AdminDest= C:\Exchsrvr

For more information about .ini file settings, see the More Information section
below.

To run batch mode Setup once you have created an .ini file, type the following at
the command prompt:

  Setup /q &lt;filepath&gt;

where filepath is the path and file name of the .ini file.

The following appendix describes the format of all possible entries for creating
an .ini file that you can run with Microsoft Exchange Server Setup in batch mode
