-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Server download logging feature writes events to the
Windows NT Event Log when users download attachments, messages, and folders from
public or private folders. You can use this information for billing or tracking
download costs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A download event is logged when the user moves or copies an item from the
private or public information store to a different store, such as a Personal
Folder file. The item can be a message, attachment, or folder, depending on the
configuration selected as described in the following section.

For example, if Log Downloads is set to 1 in the ParametersPublic registry key,
every time a user moves or copies a message with an attachment to the user's
Personal Folder file, an event is logged.

The following information is logged:

- User name

- Mailbox name

- Size of item downloaded

- Document type

- Document identifier

The following example is an event generated by the download feature.

  Event ID: 7102
  Type: Information
  Source: MSExchangeIS Private
  Category: Download
  Description:

  User WinNT_Domain\User (mailbox
  /o=Org /ou=Site /cn=Recipients /cn=Mailbox) downloaded 
  2127271 bytes from attachment 
  c7e20a0c4-9762-11d1-a487-00c04fc29f3e-b8a1

You establish download logging by editing the registry of a Microsoft Exchange
Server with RegEdit, a Windows NT administrative tool. The values you add apply
to all public and private folders on the server.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To start download logging:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe or Regedit.exe as appropriate for your
  version of Windows NT).

2. Go to the following key in the registry:

     HKEY_LOCAL_ MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS

3. Select ParametersPublic to log downloads from public folders. Select
  ParametersPrivate to log downloads from private mailboxes.

4. On the Edit menu, click Add Value and use the following entry:

     Value Name: Log Downloads
     Data Type: REG_DWORD

5. In the D_WORD Editor dialog box, type a decimal or binary value from the
  following table.

   To log downloads from      Enter a registry value of  Decimal  Binary

   Attachments only           1                          001
   Messages only              2                          010
   Attachments and messages   3                          011
   Folders only               4                          100
   Attachments and folders    5                          101
   Messages and folders       6                          110
   All                        7                          111

Use the Windows NT Event Viewer to review events recorded by the download logging
feature. To view logged downloads:

1. In the Windows NT Administrative Tools program group, choose Event Viewer.
