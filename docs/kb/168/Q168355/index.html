-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Plus! for Kids, version 1.0 
- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to copy a piece of clipart from the Picture Picker you may receive
the following error message:

  Media Gallery couldn't find that item.

  If it's one of the ones that came with Media Gallery, make sure the CD is
  available.

  If it's something you added to the collection, make sure the file is still
  there on your computer (in the same place where it was when you added it).

  You can delete "lost" files (that you added) - just click the item in the
  collection, and press the Delete key.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs if you have the Creative Writer 2 compact disc in the CD-ROM drive,
but the piece of clipart you have selected was installed with the Microsoft
Plus! For Kids program. By design, Picture Picker will attempt to copy the
clipart from the compact disc of the program that installed it.

RESOLUTION
==========

To copy the selected clipart, you must insert the compact disc from which the
clipart was installed. For example, if the Creative Writer compact disc is in
the drive when the message above appears, then you should insert the Plus! For
Kids compact disc into the CD-ROM drive.

Note: The clipart for both Creative Writer 2 and Plus! For Kids is stored in
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Kids\Common Files\Shared Content in the form of *.ath
files, i.e. Writer21.ath and Kidsplus.ath.
