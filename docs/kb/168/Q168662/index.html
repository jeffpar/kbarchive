- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3

SYMPTOMS
========

With a data link control (DLC) connection established to a mainframe over an IBM
2210 router on a slow network, the network communication fails between the
mainframe and the Microsoft DLC client.

CAUSE
=====

When the IBM 2210 router is operating on a slow network there is a possibility
that the receive buffer for the router (the receiving station) will fill up.
Under these conditions, the IBM 2210 router will send two LLC packets to the
Microsoft client (the sending station), a Receiver Not Ready (RNR) which
indicates that the last Information Frame (I-Frame) packet was received from the
sending station and that the receiving station is temporarily unavailable. Then
the sending station sends a Receiver Ready (RR) for the same sequence packet
that it had previously acknowledged with a RNR frame. This causes a problem in
the Microsoft DLC stack because our client is not expecting two acknowledgements
for the same I-Frame packet.


MORE INFORMATION
================

If you look at a network trace of this problem, you will see a RNR message from
the router immediately followed by a RR message. The Microsoft client will send
a frame reject (FRMR) message followed by a disconnect (DISC) message.

1.  RNR DSAP=0x04 SSAP=0x05 R N(R) = 0x2A FINAL  - Router
2.  RR DSAP=0x04 SSAP=0x04 C N(R) = 0x2B  - Router
3.  FRMR DSAP=0x04 SSAP=0x05 R FINAL - Client
4.  DISC DSAP=0x04 SSAP=0x04 C POLL - Client
5.  DISC DSAP=0x04 SSAP=0x04 C POLL - Client
6.  DISC DSAP=0x04 SSAP=0x04 C POLL - Client

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
