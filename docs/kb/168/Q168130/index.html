-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

After Systems Management Server jobs are canceled, it may appear that subsequent
jobs remain in a Pending state. The Systems Management Server Despoolr.log file
may display the following:

  Despooler failed to execute the instruction, error code = 38a

CAUSE
=====

Canceling a Systems Management Server job may corrupt the .sni file. This causes
the Despooler service to process very slowly through each corrupt file, and
display the message shown in the SYMPTOMS section of this article. These .sni
files are job status MIFs returning from the client, and are processed before
.ins files. It appears that Despooler is not getting to the Pending jobs.

Additionally, deleting an Active job or deleting a job before it is completely
canceled can also cause the error to occur.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date      Time     Size    File name     Platform
  -------------------------------------------------

  2/24/99   1:35pm   254,400 Smsinst.dll   X86
  2/24/99   1:34pm   481,040 Smsinst.dll   ALPHA

NOTE: Due to file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that contains
the above files may also contain additional files.



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, examine the Sms\Site.srv\Despoolr.box\Receive
directory and move all .sni files that are unrelated to current active jobs to a
temporary subdirectory.

The following are some good practices to implement:

- If you cancel your jobs, do not delete them until they have been canceled for
  48 hours.

- If you are canceling jobs, do not cancel more than one at a time.

- Do not delete Active jobs.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The hotfix changes the precedence of the Despooler's file processing. Previously
the Despooler processed files in the following order:

  .ist, .nil, .sni, .ins

Now the Despooler processes .sni files last, according to this new order:

  .ist, .nil, .ins, .sni

Additionally, the Despooler processes files in batch. By default, the Despooler
selects 50 files at a time. This hotfix allows the batch size to be configurable
by means of a registry entry.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To specify the Despooler batch size create the following registry key:

  HKEY Local Machine\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Components\SMS_Despooler\
  (DWORD) MaxFileEnum (decimal value)

To install the hotfix, perform the following steps:

1. Stop the SMS Executive service on the Systems Management Server site server.

2. Replace the Smsinst.dll file in the \Site.srv\&lt;Platform&gt;.bin directory
  with the version obtained from the hotfix.

3. Restart the SMS Executive service.

NOTE: You can perform Step 2 automatically by using Hotfix.exe with the provided
Hotfix.ini file.
