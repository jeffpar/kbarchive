-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you apply a border and/or fill to the notes pages while using the notes
master view, you may see one of the following results:

- When you attempt to apply a border and a fill, the border is applied, but the
  fill is not. When you look at the slide in notes view, it appears as though
  neither the border nor the fill were applied to the slide.

- When you attempt to apply a fill, the fill is not applied. For example, when
  you look at the slide in notes view, you will not see the fill.

- When you attempt to apply a border, the border appears to be applied.
  However, when you look at the slide in notes view, you will see one of the
  following symptoms:
   - The current slide has a border.

   - Some of the slides have a border.

   - None of the slides have a border.

These symptoms appear in the notes master, notes view, and slide view.

WORKAROUND
==========

NOTE: There is currently no workaround to apply the fill.

To work around this problem and apply a border to the notes pages, do the
following:

1. Go to the slide on which you want to add a border.

2. On the View menu, click Notes Pages.

3. On the Status Bar, click Notes Layout.

4. Click to select Reapply Master, and then click OK.

5. On the View menu, point to Master, and click Notes Master.

6. Make the changes you want to the border only.

7. On the View menu, click Notes Pages.

The changes will now appear on every slide in the presentation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.
