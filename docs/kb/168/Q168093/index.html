The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2

SYMPTOMS
========

If you delete a group from the Personal Computer Architecture using Systems
Management Server Database Manager, then attempt to re-create the group by
reloading the MIF, the attributes for that group do not reappear in the Personal
Computer Properties window, even if you quit and restart the Systems Management
Server Administrator program as required. Inventory is reported, but the group
and its attributes never reappear.

CAUSE
=====

The Inventory Dataloader does not re-create the group class in the Systems
Management Server database.

You can diagnose this problem by monitoring the Datalodr.log file for activity
similar to the following:

     Waiting for a MIF...
     Processing a machine...
     Requesting license for client S0100001
     CMachine::FindMachine - Searching for matching SMS Unique IDs
     Defining attributes for group GROUPTEST|MYTEST|1.0...
     CGroupMap::AddColumnToSpecificTable - couldn't add column to table
     CDefinedArchitecture::InsertDefinedAttribute - could not add column
     CGroup::DefineAttributes - couldn't defined attribute
     CGroup::DefineGroupAndAttributes - couldn't define attributes for
     GROUPTEST|MYTEST|1.0
     finished processing current machine.
     SQL problem detected, terminating the thread.
     SQL problem detected, terminating MIF processing thread.

The Systems Management Server Executive service caches Defined Architecture in
memory. When Dataloader receives a MIF that contains a group that existed the
last time the Systems Management Server Executive was initialized, it sees the
table(s) defined for this group class in cache, even though it has been deleted
using Database Manager. Instead of re-creating the group class, it attempts to
add to it. This results in the failure noted in the log example above. The MIF
is not placed in the Badmifs subdirectory.

WORKAROUND
==========

Stop and start the SMS_Executive service on the site server. Doing this flushes
and reinitializes the cache. Inventory Dataloader will then be able to correctly
process the MIF and re-create the group class. It may also be necessary to force
inventory or remove the appropriate computer history file for the data to appear
immediately.
