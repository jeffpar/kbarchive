SYMPTOMS
========

Thirty minutes to an hour after your Windows NT server computer is started,
clients start to have connectivity problems with the server. When accessing
resources they may receive the error:

  The remote computer is not available.

-OR-

Clicking on the server in Network Neighborhood may give the error:

  remote computer is not accessible.

Restarting the server temporarily resolves the problem, but it occurs again.

You can still ping the server by name and/or TCP/IP address.

After disabling the Quota Advisor services in Control Panel/Services, the errors
still occur.

CAUSE
=====

Quota Advisor may be the cause of the problem. There is a QAFilter device in
Control Panel/Devices that also needs to be disabled. Uninstalling the software
with the Uninstall program may not completely remove the software.

The problem has been seen with Quota Advisor (build 77).

RESOLUTION
==========

Disable the following services in Control Panel/Services:

  QAPolicy
  QAServer

Disable the following device in Control Panel/Devices:

  QAFilter

MORE INFORMATION
================

To remove the software:

- Run the Uninstall program for Quota Advisor.

- Make sure the following registry keys are removed:
