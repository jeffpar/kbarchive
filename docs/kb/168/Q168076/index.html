The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition

SYMPTOMS
========

All domain controllers register their domain name with &lt;1c&gt; as the
sixteenth character of the NetBIOS name. For each domain, a domain
name&lt;1C&gt; record will exist on a Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)
server that contains a list of IP addresses of all the domain controllers in
that domain.

When several domain controllers register the &lt;1C&gt; name with different WINS
servers, a replication problem prevents the replication partners from having an
entire list of IP addresses for this record. This may result in client logon
problems or uneven load on the domain controllers.

NOTE: This problem happens only when different domain controllers, belonging to
the same domain, register with different WINS servers, and the replication model
is NOT a hub and spoke model.

CAUSE
=====

By design, WINS cannot increment the version ID of a replica record (record
owned by another WINS server). Only the owner of the record is allowed to
increment the version ID of the record. A stalemate situation can occur where an
updated replica &lt;1C&gt; record may not be replicated because of the above
design rules.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Consider the following scenario:

  WINS1 &lt;--&gt; WINS2 &lt;--&gt; WINS3 &lt;--&gt; WINS4

  Primary Domain Controller (PDC) 1 - x.x.x.221
  Backup Domain Controller (BDC) 1 - x.x.y.60

1. PDC registers with WINS1;

  WINS1 now has:
  domain&lt;1c&gt; version id 505,
  contains ip x.x.x.221,
  owner is wins1.

2. BDC registers with WINS4

  WINS4 now has:
  domain&lt;1c&gt; version id 254
  contains ip x.x.y.60
  owner is WINS4

3. WINS1 &lt;--replicates with---&gt;WINS2

  both WINS1 and WINS2 now have:
  domain&lt;1c&gt; version id 505
  contains ip x.x.x.221
  owner is WINS1

4. WINS2 &lt;--replicates with --&gt; WINS3

  WINS1 WINS2 and WINS3 now have:
  domain&lt;1c&gt; version id 505
  contains ip x.x.x.221
  owner is WINS1

5. WINS3 &lt;-replicates-&gt; WINS4

  WINS4 now has :
  domain&lt;1c&gt; newer version id 255 (or more)
  contains: ip x.x.x.221;ip x.x.y.60;
  owner WINS4

  WINS3 now has:
  domain&lt;1c&gt; SAME version id 505
  contains: ip x.x.x.221;ip x.x.y.60;
  owner WINS1

NOTE: Version number is not incremented for this record because this is a replica
record and is owned by WINS1.

6. WINS2&lt;--replicates with--&gt;WINS3

  domain&lt;1c&gt; record on WINS2 is not
  updated containing only ip x.x.x.221

RESOLUTION
==========

The resolution is to give ownership to the WINS Server that merges the
&lt;1c&gt; record. In other words, a replication partner can take ownership for
a 1C record, if it receives a replica 1C record from a second replication
partner.

In the above scenario the behavior will be:

(Steps 1-4 are the same)

5. WINS3 &lt;-replicates-&gt; WINS4

  WINS4 now has :
  domain&lt;1c&gt; version id 255 (wins4's highest id number)
  contains: ip x.x.x.221;ip x.x.y.60;
  owner WINS4

  WINS3 now has:
  domain&lt;1c&gt; version id 2000(wins3's highest number)
  contains: ip x.x.x.221;ip x.x.y.60;
  ****owner WINS3 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;NOTE

6. WINS2&lt;--replicates with--&gt;WINS3

  WINS2 now has:
  domain&lt;1c&gt; version id 442&lt;&lt;wins2's highest number&gt;
  contains ip x.x.x.221;ip x.x.y.60;
  ***owner WINS2 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;NOTE

7. WINS1&lt;--replicates with--&gt;WIN2

  WINS1 now has:
  domain&lt;1c&gt; version id 506 &lt;WINS1's highest number at that time&gt;
  contains ip x.x.x.221;ip x.x.y.60;
  owner WINS1
