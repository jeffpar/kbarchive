-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Policy Editor to modify the search mode used by the Microsoft
Client for NetWare Networks, the registry key relating to the search mode is
modified, but the search mode functionality provided by the Microsoft Client for
NetWare Networks is unchanged.

CAUSE
=====

When you use Policy Editor to modify the search mode used by the Microsoft
Client for NetWare Networks, the SearchMode value under the following registry
key is changed to a DWORD value, and assigned the value that you specify in
Policy Editor:

  Hkey_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\Nwredir

This registry value is given a value of 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7, which normally
causes the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks to use the appropriate search
mode. However, for the search mode to be properly modified, the SearchMode value
must be a binary value, not a DWORD value.

RESOLUTION
==========

NOTE: For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And
Values online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should
make a backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you
edit the registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

To correct the problem described in this article, use Registry Editor to delete
the existing SearchMode value under the following registry key:

  Hkey_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD\Nwredir

After you delete the SearchMode value, create a new binary value with the same
name, and assign it one of the following values:

  Value    Description
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  0 or 1   Uses the default search mode. The Microsoft Client for NetWare
           Networks searches the search drives only when no path is
           specified in the program and after the default directory has
           been searched.

  2        Causes the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks not to search
           any search drives to find supporting files. The program
           behaves as if you were running it without networking. If the
           program has a defined directory path for searching and opening
           files, the program searches for the files in that path.

  3        The same as 1, except that if the program has no defined
           directory path to search and open files, the Microsoft Client
           for NetWare Networks searches the search drives only if the
           open request is a read-only request.

  5        Causes the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks to always
           search the search drives, even if the program specifies a
           path.

  7        The same as 5, except that the Microsoft Client for NetWare
           Networks searches the search drives only if the open request
           is a read-only request.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
