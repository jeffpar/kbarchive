The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to print using a Hewlett-Packard (HP) DeskJet 500 series printer,
you experience unusual printer behavior. Some of the following behaviors may
occur:

- If you try to print the document in landscape (wide) orientation, the
  document prints in portrait (tall).

- If you try to print the document in portrait, the document prints in
  landscape (wide).

- You cannot change the orientation of the document.

- Settings in the Printers Control Panel have no affect on how the document is
  displayed on screen, or how it is printed with the HP printer driver.

These problems occur with HP printer driver version 6.1D.

NOTE: Printer drivers versions 3.1 and 5.0 do not exhibit this behavior.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use one of the following two methods to resolve your printing problems.

Method 1
--------

Switch to a different version of the printer driver. For more information about
how to accomplish this task in Windows, see your Windows printed documentation
or online help.

Method 2
--------

If you want to continue using the version 6.1D printer driver, only change the
Portrait/Landscape settings from the Creative Writer Control Room.

Change the orientation of the document you wish to print by using the following
steps:

1. Open the Creative Writer document.

2. To get to the Control Room, press and hold down the CTRL key and the SHIFT
  key while you press the A key (CTRL+SHIFT+A). Click OK.

3. On the File menu, click Printing Options.

4. Click Set Global.

5. In the Print dialog box (which lists the current settings for the HP DeskJet
  printer), click Setup.

6. Click the orientation you prefer for the document (for example, Portrait or
  Landscape). Click OK in both Print dialog boxes.

7. On the File menu, click Return To Creative Writer.

8. To set the orientation to the setting specified in step 6, do the following:
  a. Click the Page Stuff tool (the book with the Ruler in it).

  b. Click the Tall or Wide tool.

  c. Click Tall or Wide.

9. Print your document.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With other printer drivers, as well as with other versions of HP printer
drivers, you can print documents as they show on screen. You can also switch the
page orientation for all documents.
