-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.x, on platform(s):
   - the operating system: Mac OS (all) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Macintosh client, you may get the following error message:

  Before you can use private folders, your Administrator must run the Reset
  function on your user id.

If you click the OK button, the Macintosh Mail client opens as designed; however,
the Private Folders icon is dimmed.

If you try to access your private folders from the Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks, MS-DOS workstation, you will get the following error:

  Notice 127 Private Folder Index Missing.

CAUSE
=====

The &lt;HEX-ID&gt;.IDX file is missing from the FOLDERS\LOC\&lt;HEX-ID&gt;
directory on the server.

You may also see this message if the mailbox was created with a version of the
Mail Administrator's program (Admin.exe) earlier than 2.1b. Version 2.1b of
ADMIN.EXE is dated 04-03-91 and is 290,801 bytes in size.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you had private folders, you can restore the index file from a recent backup.
The program FIXIDX can also be used if no backup is available. FIXIDX
regenerates the &lt;HEX-ID&gt;.IDX file from the existing private folder files.

NOTE: Running FIXIDX will result in the loss of all folder names.

FIXIDX is included with Microsoft Mail Server version 3.5 on the disk labeled
Utilities. For more details about FIXIDX, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q99419 PC DB: Database Maintenance Utilities (Complete)

If you did not have any private folders, or the above procedure was not
successful, you can use the Reset function in the Mail Administrator's program
(Admin.exe) to generate a new index file.

If a version earlier than 2.1b of the Mail Administrator's program was used to
create the mailbox, run the Reset function with version 2.1b or later of
Admin.exe to resolve the problem.

Software for the Macintosh "User's Guide."
