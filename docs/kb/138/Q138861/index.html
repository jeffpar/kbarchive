Last Modified: 13-JUN-2001

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.11, on platform(s):
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The SNA Server 2.11 readme file includes the following section, though the
alternate DLL files mentioned are not included on the 2.11 product CD:

  C.4. EHNAPPC.DLL Compatibility with Attachmate RALLY! and PC Support

  IBM PC Support and Attachmate RALLY! are examples of applications that depend
  on the static ordinal numbering of entry points in EHNAPPC.DLL. Various
  vendors' implementations of EHNAPPC.DLL differ in this static numbering, and
  many applications use dynamic linking by entry point name to avoid this
  problem.

  The version installed by default with the SNA Client is compatible with IBM
  CA/400. However, this version is not compatible with RALLY!, and will cause
  this application to fail via general protection failure or a pop-up message
  with the text "Assertion failed." SNA Server provides alternate versions of
  EHNAPPC.DLL and EHNRTRW.DLL which are compatible with the NetSoft
  EHNAPPC.DLL, for use with these applications.

  The alternate DLLs are found in the CD-ROM directory \CLIENTS\WIN3X\EHNNS\ and
  must be copied into the Windows system directory if you encounter this error.

CAUSE
=====

The alternate DLL files were inadvertently left off the SNA Server 2.11 CD.

RESOLUTION
==========

The alternate DLL files can be found in Rally.zip, located on the following
electronic locations:

- FTP.MICROSOFT.COM, in \bussys\winnt\sna-public\rally.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT. This
problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server for Windows NT, 2.11 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
