Advanced C++ Programming - Styles and Idioms
by, James O. Coplien
(Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-54855-0)

  Assuming a background in the basic syntax of C++, this book imparts the
  proficiency that expert C++ programmers gain through experience by giving a
  feel for the styles and idioms of the language. It shows how different styles
  let C++ be used for simple data abstraction, full- fledged abstract data type
  implementation, and various styles of object- oriented programming. It also
  explores idioms that the core of the C++ language does not support, such as
  functional and frame-based programming, and advanced garbage collection
  techniques.

Object-Oriented Technology: A Manager's Guide
by, David A. Taylor, Ph.D.
(Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-56358-4)

  This book is an introduction and guide to object-oriented technology for
  managers, sales people, engineers, software developers, and anyone interested
  in this technology. It explains object-oriented terminology and concepts.
  Explanations and creative illustrations make learning about objects
  enjoyable. You can become object-oriented literate in a couple of hours. The
  book translates the advantages of this technology into clear business
  benefits, allowing both managers and software developers to make informed
  decisions about the direction of their computing environment.

Object-Oriented Systems Design: An Integrated Approach
by, Edward Yourdon
(Yourdon Press Computing Systems, ISBN 0-13-636325-3)

  Object-orientation (OO) is an important technology, and has already made an
  important contribution to the software engineering field. However, there is
  still a great deal to learn about OO, and a number of technical problems to
  solve. But OO, like all other technologies, does not exist in a vacuum; it is
  used within a larger context of project management and organizational
  cultures.

  The author is aware of the impact these managerial and cultural issues have on
  the success or failure of technologies such as OO, CASE technology, and
  structured methods. This perspective may help identify the intended audience
  of this book. It is not intended for the pure technician whose primary
  interest is rigorous theory and formal methods. Instead, it is aimed at the
  practitioner -- the systems developer or manager who has to make OO work in
  the real world -- a world filled with politics, demanding deadlines, and
  increasing pressure for rapid solutions to urgent problems.

  Because this book is concerned with analysis and design issues more than
  programming issues in C++ or Smalltalk, it will be of interest primarily to
  systems analysts, designers, software architects, and project managers.

Object-Oriented Analysis and Design with Applications, Second Edition
by, Grady Booch
(Benjamin/Cummings Publishing, ISBN 0-8053-5340-2)

  The first edition of this book was instrumental in making object- oriented
  technology a practical reality. Hundreds of projects applied Booch's notation
  and process to complex problems in diverse domains. In this new edition,
  Grady Booch draws upon the rich and varied results of these projects to offer
  improved methods for object development and a new, unified notation. With
  numerous examples, all of which are now implemented in C++, Booch illustrates
  essential concepts, explains the method, and shows successful applications in
  a variety of fields. You'll also find pragmatic advice on a host of issues,
  including classification, implementation strategies, and cost-effective
  project management.

  This new edition uses C++ in all programming examples and applications and
  gives new examples of real-world projects, including a client/server
  architecture and an application framework.

  The book also distinguishes between good and bad object-oriented analysis and
  design and shows how to evaluate architectural tradeoffs to manage
  complexity. This is a reference for anyone who implements or manages object
  technologies, or who wishes to begin exploration of this important new
  paradigm.

Object-Oriented Software Engineering: A Use Case Driven Approach
by, Ivar Jacobson
(Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-54435-0)

  This book is based on Objectory, which is the first commercially- available
  comprehensive object-oriented process for developing large- scale industrial
  systems. Ivar Jacobson developed Objectory as a result of 20 years of
  experience building real software-based products. This approach takes a
  global view of systems development and focuses on minimizing the system's
  life cycle cost. Objectory is an extensible industrial process that provides
  a method for building large industrial systems.

Practical Applications of Object-Oriented Techniques to Relational Databases
by, Donald K. Burleson
(Wiley, ISBN 0-471-61225-1)

  This book shows systems professionals how to apply object-oriented techniques
  to relational databases. This very practical guide provides a wealth of
  proven programming strategies and constructs that enable legacy databases to
  function within the scope of an object-technology application.

  The book includes dozens of real-life examples and shows how to apply object
  techniques to relational databases, including dBASE, DB2, ORACLE, and IDMS.

  This work is part of the Object Management Group Series on Object Technology
  and is a clearly written, nuts-and-bolts guide to object- oriented databases
  and techniques with relational databases that administrators, analysts, and
  database designers will find useful.

Object-Orientation: Concepts, Languages, Databases, User Interfaces
by, Setrag Khoshafian and Razmik Abnous
(Wiley, ISBN 0-471-51801-8)

  A comprehensive guide to the main concepts of today's most popular
  object-oriented systems. Designed to clarify the basic concepts associated
  with object-orientation, this book provides the information you need to
  improve your programming style, regardless of whether or not you use an
  object-oriented programming language.

  It reveals the underlying commonalties of such object-oriented systems as
  programming environments, user interfaces, and database applications. Some of
  the other topics include:

- Object-oriented system and language design paradigms, including abstract data
  types, inheritance, and object identity.

- Implementation of object-oriented applications using practical, real-world
  examples in C++ and Ada.

- Manifestation of object-oriented concepts in user interface design, including
  windowing systems and tool kits.

- Discussion of the emerging field of object-oriented databases, with
  particular emphasis on how object-oriented concepts and database capabilities
  are integrated in these next generation database management systems. Suitable
  for software developers, software engineers, data processing professionals,
  programmers, and students.

Object-Oriented Information Systems: Planning and Implementation
by, David A. Taylor, Ph.D.
(Wiley, ISBN 0-471-54364-0)

  This book is aimed at the general manager who realizes that the use and
  control of total information is the key to their company's competitive
  advantage. Written in a clear, easy-to-understand manner, this guide cuts
  through the usual technojargon, enabling managers to make informed decisions
  for successful system installation and development. Discussions on how to
  purchase, build, and maintain flexible, powerful, and competitive
  object-oriented technologies. Includes a helpful fast- track feature that
  summarizes the contents of every page in the outer margins.

Object Technology in Application Development
by, Daniel Tkach and Richard Puttick
(Benjamin/Cummings Publishing, ISBN 0-8053-2572-7)

  This comprehensive guide, developed at IBM's International Technical Support
  Center in San Jose, CA, is a ideal for managers and developers looking to
  apply object-oriented methods in large-scale information technology
  environments. Demonstrating the ups, downs, and trade-offs of object-oriented
  methodologies, the authors provide information that will help managers make
  choices about the resources and technologies available for application
  development.

  The book discusses the impact of object technology on management decisions
  with examples from real, full-scale environments in which productivity has
  increased from the use of this technology. This work covers the following:

- Provides a solid explanation of the principles of object-oriented technology.

- Describes and compares the methodologies in use in object-oriented
  development environments.

- Analyzes the role of CASE tools in object-oriented development.

- Presents the issues involved in building a user interface.

- Includes a full chapter on the process of team building in object-oriented
  applications.

- Details the use of a configuration management tool.

- Explains how legacy code can be reused in object-oriented environments.

Object Data Management: Object-Oriented and Extended Relational Database Systems
by, R.G.G. Cattell
(Addison-Wesley, ISBN 0-201-53092-9)

  This book is the first comprehensive introduction to the latest and most
  promising database technologies -- database systems that manipulate objects.
  Principal examples include object-oriented and extended relational database
  systems. The author, who has been active in both the development and the
  evaluation of such technologies, examines the nature and benefits of the new
  systems, compares them with conventional systems, and shows the range of
  applications they now make possible.

  Object data management is particularly useful where a large quantity of
  complex data needs to be managed, as in science and engineering,
  computer-aided design and manufacturing (CAD/CAM), computer-aided software
  engineering (CASE), office automation, and new approaches to traditional
  business problems. Readers will find the book valuable not just for learning
  about these technologies and their applications, but for evaluation the
  various claims being made for them.

  The author's aim is to provide a broad look at newly available database
  systems and an objective foundation on which decisions about them can be
  based. Any database system user interested in the latest technologies,
  particularly users with large amounts of complex data to manage, will find
  this book an invaluable resource. Students, designers, and implementers of
  such systems will also find it packed with useful information for their
  needs.

Code Complete
by, Steve McConnell
(Microsoft Press, ISBN 1-55615-484-4)

  Whatever your background -- experienced developer, self-taught programmer, or
  programming student -- this ingeniously organized handbook contains
  state-of-the-art information that can help you write better programs in less
  time with fewer headaches. Code Complete is not a panacea, but it is an
  encyclopedic treatment of software construction, a critical part of the
  software-development cycle.

  It contains some 500 examples of code (good and bad) and includes ready-to-use
  checklists to help you assess your architecture, design approach, and module
  and routine quality. It also provides a larger perspective on the software
  development process and the role of construction in the process that will
  inform and stimulate your thinking about your own projects, enabling you to
  take strategic action rather than fight the same battles again and again.

  The concepts are applicable to any procedural language in any computing
  environment. Although Code Complete does not focus on object-oriented
  development, it does relate since logical instructions are also required in
  object-oriented development.

Object Magazine
(Sigs Publications)

  This monthly technical magazine focuses on object-oriented technology in all
  aspects from management, software development processes, analysis, design,
  implementation, methodology, and future trends. Many of the authors of the
  OOP books above are monthly contributors.

Simple C++
by, Jeffrey M. Cogswell
(Waite Group Press, ISBN 1-878739-44-1)

  A quick, fun introduction to the basics of object-oriented programming. The
  first portion of each chapter covers general OOP concepts, such as
  encapsulation, inheritance, attributes and methods. The second half of each
  chapter uses actual C++ programs to illustrate points. This book will ease
  your first steps into OOP, and the C++ specifics will translate fairly well
  to other languages.
