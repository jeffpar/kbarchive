Last Modified: 13-JUN-2001

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, on platform(s):
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

This article describes how to configure SNA Server to communicate with an IBM
S/36 (SSP release 5.5 or later) over 802.2 Token Ring to support 5250 emulation.
Both SNA Server and S/36 configuration parameters are discussed.

NOTE: The SNA Server 5250 applet shipped with SNA server 2.11 and before did not
support S/36 device emulation. An updated applet which supports both AS/400 and
S/36 is available from Microsoft.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.0, 2.1,
2.11 and 2.11 Service Pack 1. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft
SNA Server 2.11 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

  S E R V P A C K


MORE INFORMATION
================

These instructions assume all of the following:

- The Windows NT DLC transport driver is already installed and is bound to the
  correct network adapter.

- The SNA Server DLC link service is already installed using SNA Server Setup.

- The system has been restarted.

S/36 Configuration
------------------

1. Sign on to the S/36 console.

2. Determine the S/36 token ring adapter address:

   - At the command line type STATUS COMCNFIG.

   - Enter "1" (without the quotation marks) in the field to display specific
     line status.

   - Enter "9" (without the quotation marks) in the next screen to display the
     status of the token ring line.

  NOTE: Lines 9 and 10 are the only valid lines for token ring on the S/36. If
  no adapter address is displayed, verify that you are using the correct line
  number, and that the token ring card is properly installed.

3. Note the adapter address for use in configuring SNA Server. Press CMD7 until
  you are back at the main S/36 menu. If necessary, use the BLDLIBR command to
  create a library to contain the communications configuration.

4. Type CNFIGICF to start configuring the S/36 communications.

5. First, define an ICF line member for your token ring line. On the "SSP-ICF
  CONFIGURATION MEMBER DEFINITION" screen enter a name for your token ring line
  member description and the library in which to create it. Type "1" (without
  the quotation marks) to create a new member, then press ENTER.

6. On screen 2.0 enter "3" (without the quotation marks) for SNA.

7. On screen 4.0 enter "4" (without the quotation marks) for a token ring line
  member. A second question appears. Enter "Y" (without the quotation marks) to
  indicate that APPC will be used.

8. On the "SNA LINE MEMBER ATTRIBUTES" screen, enter the exchange ID (XID) and
  SAP values. In most cases "00000" can be used for the XID and "04" can be
  used for the SAP.

9. On screen 12.5 type a "1" (without the quotation marks) to create a new
  remote system with the name of your SNA Server in the "Remote System Name"
  field. Press ENTER.

10. On screen 13.0 enter "2" (without the quotation marks) for a peer system.
  Press ENTER.

11. Enter the two parts of the SNA Server's XID. This value must match the Local
  node ID value in the 802.2 Setup window in SNA Server admin. Press ENTER.

12. Enter the adapter address and SAP value for your SNA Server. The appropriate
  SAP address for your SNA Server can be found in the Link properties for the
  link service used by the connection to the S/36. In most cases this will be
  "04". Press ENTER which returns you to the "SNA LINE MEMBER ATTRIBUTES"
  screen. Then press Cmd5 to restart CNFIGICF.

13. Define a communications subsystem member. The screen currently shows the
  name for the line member you just created. Change the member name to a new
  name for your new subsystem member. Select the following options:

   - "1" for Create a member.

   - "3" for SNA, "1" for SNA subsystem,

   - "7" for APPN.

  You should now see the "SUBSYSTEM MEMBER DEFINITION" screen.

14. Type the system and network names for your S/36. These values correspond to
  the Control Point Name and Network Name fields in the Remote Node Name
  section of the 802.2 Setup window.

15. On screen 28.0 select "1" to define a non-networking node. Press ENTER and
  you are prompted for a line member name. Type in the name of the line member
  from step 5 above. Press ENTER.

16. Type "1" (without the quotation marks) to create a new location. Enter the
  name of your SNA Server in the Remote location name and Remote system name
  fields. This name must match the Control Point name in the Server Properties
  window in SNA Server Admin.

17. Type "2" (without the quotation marks) next to the entry you just created
  and press ENTER. On the next screen enter "N" (without the quotation marks)
  for Send alerts, "N" (without the quotation marks) for Single-session
  location and "Y" (without the quotation marks) for Stay Operational. Press
  ENTER, then CMD7 to return to the APPN SUBSYSTEM MEMBER DEFINITION screen.

18. Enter "5" (without the quotation marks) to begin defining the QPCSUPP mode.
  The S/36 refers to modes as "session groups".

19. Type "1" (without the quotation marks) to create a new session group,
  "QPCSUPP", in the Session group name and Default session group fields, then
  press Enter. Go down to the new entry and edit it with option "2".

20. Enter "1" (without the quotation marks) for Interactive, "32" (without the
  quotation marks) for the session limit, and "00" (without the quotation
  marks) for the other fields. NOTE: It should be possible to set the maximum
  session limit to 64, but there is unofficial word that a single S/36 token
  ring card will only support 32 sessions. You will need to press ENTER twice
  to continue.

21. Enter "07" (without the quotation marks) for the pacing size, "16384"
  (without the quotation marks) for the maximum RU size, and "N" (without the
  quotation marks) for the Acquire sessions field. Press Enter. You can now
  press CMD7 until you exit CNFIGICF. Once you ENABLE the line your S/36 is
  ready to communicate.

SNA Server Configuration
------------------------

Configure the following entries using the SNA Server Admin program:

1. Select the SNA Server service (which appears as the Windows NT machine name),
  located in the Servers and Connections window of Admin. Enter the following
  parameters:

  SNA Network Control Point Name
   - Network Name = "APPN" (without the quotation marks) (or Network ID in the
     S/36 Subsystem Member Definition).

   - Control Point Name = This is the Remote location name and Remote system
     name in the S/36 APPN Subsystem Member definition. For simplicity, this
     should be set to the local Windows NT machine name.

  (These values were specified in step 14 of the S/36 configuration.)

  Choose OK.

2. Add a new Local APPC LU off the server service by choosing the Insert button
  and entering the following parameters:

  "LU 6.2 Type = Independent

  LU Alias = For simplicity, this should be the same as the
  Local LU Name below.

  Network Name = APPN (same as network name in step 1)

  LU Name = This is the same as the control point name in step 1.

  All other entries can remain at default values. " (without the quotation
  marks)

  NOTE: It is most efficient for all SNA Server users to use the same Local APPC
  LU. However, it is possible to create a unique LU for each user if desired,
  where the LU alias and LU name above could be replaced with the actual user
  name (although this requires additional administration to maintain).

  Choose OK.

3. Configure the SNA Server 802.2 connection by zooming on the connection name:

     Link Service = SnaDlc1 (or name specified during SNA setup)

     Remote End   = Peer System

     Activation   = Pick the value appropriate for your environment.

     Allowed Directions = Outgoing calls. Check Incoming Calls if you
                          want the S/36 to be able to activate the link.

     Choose the Setup button configure the following parameters:

        Remote Network Address = Set to the network adapter address of the
                                 S/36.

        Local Node ID = Leave at default - 05D FFFFF.

        Remote Node Name:

        Network Name = APPN (same as Network Name in step 1)

        Control Point Name = S/36 local system name, configured in the
                             S/36 APPN Subsystem Member Definition.

        Remote Node ID = Not used (leave blank)

        Advanced options can be left at their default settings

  Choose OK.

4. Add a new Remote APPC LU off the connection by choosing the Insert button and
  entering the following parameters:

     LU Alias     = For simplicity, this should be the same as the
                    Remote APPC LU Name below.

     Network Name = APPN (Same as other network values above)

     LU Name      = Must be set to the S/36 system name.

     Uninterpreted LU Name = Not used (leave at default setting).

     Select Supports Parallel Sessions (required).

     Choose the Partners button. The Remote APPC LU must be partnered
     with the Local APPC LU created above, using the QPCSUPP mode. Because
     Enable Automatic Partnering is enabled by default for APPC LU's,
     this pairing will already be added.

  Choose OK.

5. Save the SNA Server configuration file and restart the SNA Server service.
  Once the SNA Server service is Active, all connections configured to activate
  on server startup will go into a Pending state, then switch to Active.

  NOTE: If the connection stays in Pending mode and doesn't activate:

  a. Check the Windows NT Application Event Log (using Event Viewer) to see the
     reason why the connection isn't activating. For example, if the S/36 is
     not responding to TEST commands, then the remote network address may not
     be correct.

  b. Verify the configuration entries above with your S/36 system administrator
     and make sure the S/36 line and communications subsystem are enabled.

  c. Check if the S/36 is logging any console messages when SNA Server attempts
     to establish the connection.

  d. If the connection activates but users are unable to open 5250 sessions,
     zoom on the Status button on the Local APPC LU, which should show the
     following (when working correctly):

     Partner LU    Mode       Connection     Sessions   Limit
     -----------   --------   ------------   --------   ------
     &lt;remote LU&gt;   SNASVCMG   &lt;connection&gt;   0          2
     &lt;remote LU&gt;   QPCSUPP    &lt;connection&gt;   0          32

     This means that up to 32 sessions are available for use, though no sessions
     are currently active.
