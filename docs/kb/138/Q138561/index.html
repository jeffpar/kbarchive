-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the drop down arrow of a combo box on a form is clicked, the combo box does
not appear to drop down. If the form is moved after this is done, then the list
can be seen as though it were behind the form. However, clicking the form's
title bar will cause the Combo Box list to appear in its expected location. This
behavior occurs regardless of the RowSourceType or RowSource property settings.

CAUSE
=====

The form properties AlwaysOnTop and Desktop are both set to true.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual FoxPro 3.0b
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a form, and set its AlwaysOnTop and Desktop properties to true.

2. Place a combo box on the form and set its RowSourceType property to 7 -
  Files.

3. Save and run the form.

4. Click the down arrow on the combo box to see that the combo box does not
  appear to drop down. Drag the form away such that the area under the combo
  box is exposed and the list can be seen under it.
