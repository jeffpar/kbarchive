-------     --------              -----------
S15602      WINDONUT.EXE          The WINDONUT.EXE file contains the source

                                 for Windows 95 Gives You Direct Hardware
                                 Control for Speedy Animation," by Dave
                                 Edson.

                                 The Game SDK is a collection of
                                 technologies that finally lets you
                                 build Windows-based games with the
                                 speed of MS-DOS-based games. It gives
                                 you control of the hardware for
                                 lightning-fast graphics. Dave Edson
                                 demonstrates DirectDraw with a sample
                                 application.

S15603      MFCPART5.EXE          The MFCPART5.EXE file contains the source
                                 code for the article named "Programming
                                 Windows 95 with MFC, Part V: Menus,
                                 Toolbars, and Status Bars," by Jeff
                                 Prosise.

                                 Things really come together in this
                                 installment, as Jeff Prosise discusses
                                 menu handling in the context of MFC.
                                 He shows how to write update handlers,
                                 provide keyboard shortcuts, and work
                                 with toolbars, status bars, and
                                 context menus.

                                 of C++ Exception Handling," by
                                 Scott Meyers.

                                 The addition of exceptions to the C++
                                 language adds new unexpected depths to
                                 programming. Scott Meyers demonstrates
                                 key techniques that will help you
                                 build robust, efficient, correctly
                                 functioning applications even in the
                                 presence of exceptions.

                                 code for the column, "C/C++ Q &amp; A," by
