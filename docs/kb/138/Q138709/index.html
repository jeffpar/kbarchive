SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft has released the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services
(MSNDS). MSNDS lets you connect to NDS servers and run many important utilities.
MSNDS provides the following networking features to support computers running on
Novell NetWare 4.x networks:

- Integrated login to NetWare 4.x servers.

- Full support of NetWare 4.x login scripts.

- The ability to use Network Neighborhood to browse the directory tree.

- An interface for programs created using the original version of the 16-bit
  Novell NetWare Client SDK. Many 16-bit NDS-aware programs written using
  documented calls from the NetWare Client SDK, such as Netadmin.exe and
  Nwadmin.exe, can run using this interface, but no guarantee is provided.
  Custom programs written using the 16-bit NetWare Client SDK are not
  supported. An interface for programs created using the 32-bit NetWare Client
  SDK is not provided.

- Ability to connect to bindery-based NetWare 3.x servers
