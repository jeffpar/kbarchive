- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 5.0, 6.0 
- Microsoft Data Access Components version 2.5

SYMPTOMS
========

Calling TABLEUPDATE() on a SQL table does not succeed in the following
situation. A remote view on a SQL table contains a timestamp field, and the
WhereType property of the view is set to "Key &amp; Timestamp." When updates are
sent to the remote SQL table, the first TABLEUPDATE() successfully updates
records. However, if changes are made to the local tables, and you call
TABLEUPDATE() a second time, the update is not successful, or the "Update
Conflict" error is displayed. However, the TimeStamp field is not modified in
the local cursor, and you expected the update to be successful.

CAUSE
=====

When the SQL Where clause or the WhereType properties are set to "Key and
TimeStamp," the update fails if the timestamp of the record on the remote table
has changed since you first retrieved it. The TimeStamp field of the remote
table is updated by the server. The first update to the table on the server
modifies the TimeStamp field. If the data is not refreshed on the local server,
the data on the cursor and the data on the remote server are not the same, and a
conflict occurs when TABLEUPDATE() is called a second time.

The following example illustrates this. The TimeStamp values are fictitious in
this example, they are only for demonstration.

DBKey     FIELD1    TimeStamp
-----------------------------

1         "string1"    1
2         "string2"    2
3         "string3"    3

Assume you've created a remote view against this table, and set all the fields to
be updatable. Additionally, the Wheretype is "Key &amp; Timestamp."

If you change record two to "changed" instead of "string2," the local FoxPro
cursor now looks like this:

DBKey     FIELD1    TimeStamp
-----------------------------

1         "string1"    1
2         "changed"    2
3         "string3"    3

When you call TABLEUPDATE(), Visual FoxPro sends the change to the server. The
server, in turn, updates the timestamp value for that record:

DBKey     FIELD1    TimeStamp
-----------------------------
 1       "string1"    1
 2       "changed"   10
 3       "string3"    3

Now if you change record two again and try to update it, the "Update Conflict"
message appears.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use GO RECNO() and call REFRESH() to refresh the data on the local cursor before
the second update takes place. You can also call REQUERY() if you want to
recreate the cursor from the remote data. For more information about the
difference between the REQUERY() and the REFRESH() functions, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q130462 Difference Between REQUERY and REFRESH in Visual FoxPro

With Visual FoxPro for Windows 3.0b, you do not need the GO RECNO(). REQUERY or
REFRESH should be sufficient.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a SQL Server table called Test that contains these fields:

     DBKey      float
     FIELD1     char
     TimeStamp  timestamp

  Add some records similar to the ones illustrated in the CAUSE section of this
  article. Using the ODBC manager, create a DataSource to access the Database
  of the table.

2. Create a database in Visual FoxPro with a remote view called Rv, based on the
  datasource created in the previous step.

3. In the remote view:

   - Select the Add All button in the Fields tab.

   - In the Update Criteria tab:

     Select DBkey field as the key and make it updatable. Click the Update All
     button. Select the Send SQL Updates check box. In the SQL WHERE clause,
     select Key and Timestamp button.

4. Close and save the view.

5. Browse the Rv view.

6. Change the FIELD1 field.

7. Move to the second record, and change the FIELD1 field.

8. Move back to the first field, and change FIELD1 again. The "Update Conflict"
  error appears.
