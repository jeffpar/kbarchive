-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The NODEFAULT clause is ignored in the KeyPress event of a text box custom class
based on the text box base class.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this, perform the following:

1. Edit the form.

2. Click the text box on the form.

3. Right-click the KeyPress event in the property sheet, and then click Reset to
  Default.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Create a form, and place a text box on the form.

2. In the KeyPress event of the text box, enter the word, NODEFAULT.

3. Save the text box as a class.

4. Delete the text box from your form.

5. Place an instance of the text box class on your form. You can do this by
  adding the class library that contains the text box to the Form Control
  toolbar. Next, drop the text box control onto the form.

6. Run the form and note that you are unable to type in the form. This is the
  expected behavior.

7. Edit your form, and add the following line to the KeyPress event of the
  instance of the text box:

  " TEXTBOX::KEYPRESS " (without the quotation marks)

8. Run your form. Note that you can now type into it, but each letter you type
  is doubled. This is the expected behavior.

9. Edit your form, and from the KeyPress event of your text box, delete the code
  you entered in step 7 (the line TEXTBOX::KEYPRESS).

10. Run your form. Note that now you can type into it even though you removed
  the code you added and returned it to its original status where you couldn't
  type into it.
