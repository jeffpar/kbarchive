SUMMARY
=======

When the Form Wizard builds a form, it creates the form so that when the form
runs, the objects that hold data are disabled. Clicking the Edit button enables
the objects and allows editing of the information. However, if controls other
than check boxes, text boxes, or OLE-bound controls are added to the form, they
are enabled, not disabled, when the form is run.

This article shows you how to disable controls such as combo boxes and list boxes
so that they are disabled when the form runs and enabled when the Edit button is
clicked. The code that controls which objects are disabled or enabled is located
in the Wizstyle.vcx form. The combo and list boxes were not included in that
code, but you can modify the code to include the combo and list boxes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Step-by-Step Procedure
----------------------

1. On the File menu, click Open, and change Files of Type to Visual Class
  Library. In the \Vfp\Wizards\ directory, select Wizstyle.vcx. In the Open
  box, choose TXTBTNS as the Class Name. The Class Designer will appear and
  allow the editing of the wizard buttons.

2. Double-click any button. In the Object box, select TXTBTNS. In the Procedures
  box, select SETALLPROP. In this code, look for the following line (it is
  split here for readability):

     CASE ATC(m.oControlParent.Controls[m.i].BaseClass,
        "CheckBox,TextBox,OleBoundControl") # 0
            m.oControlParent.Controls[m.i].Enabled = THIS.EditMode

3. Note that CheckBox, TextBox, and OleBoundControl are the only objects
  referenced here. Add "ComboBox, ListBox, EditBox" to this line of code.

4. Save the changes, and create or open a wizard-generated form. Add a combo box
  based on a field from a table. When you run the form, note that the combo box
  is disabled until you click the Edit button.

By changing the code in the TXTBTNS class, this change will also effect the way
the picture buttons in PICBTNS behave on the combo and list boxes.
