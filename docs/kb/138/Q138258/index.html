General Information
-------------------

Debug Symbol files (symbols) are required to do both kernel and user-mode
debugging in Windows NT. Symbols provide a way to reference global variables and
function names in the loaded executable.

Symbols are produced by the linker. They are stripped out of retail product and
saved in a separate (.DBG) file. This considerably reduces file size which
decreases file load time and thus increases system performance. It also reduces
the number of install floppies. Symbols represent Function/API names and global
variables.

The .DBG File contains symbolic information for each file. They can be found on
the installation CD-ROM in \Support\Debug\[i386 | mips]\Symbols. They can also
be found on the NT build server. The location is
\\Ntbuilds\Release\Usa\Build###\[x86 | mips |alpha]\Fre.srv\symbols.

The Symbols directory is divided up into seven subdirectories, called Extension
Subdirectories (note that many of the symbol files in these directories are User
mode):

  COM - symbols for all files ending in .COM go here
  CPL - symbols for all files ending in .CPL go here.
  DLL - symbols for all files ending in .DLL go here
  DRV - symbols for all files ending in .DRV go here
  EXE - symbols for all files ending in .EXE go here
  SCR - symbols for all files ending in .SCR go here
  SYS - symbols for all files ending in .SYS go here.

Symbols must match file versions:

Symbols from a different build give erroneous information and send developers
chasing shadows and waste considerable time. Double check with the customer what
build the customer is running and if the customer has any patches installed. The
Kernel Stop Screen displays the build number of the kernel.

Patched Builds:

Patched builds such as Service Packs require a special set of symbols, that is a
combination of the base build and the patched symbols.

Setting Up Custom Symbol Trees
------------------------------

Remember that symbols must match the files installed on a customer's computer.
You often have to create a custom set of symbols just for a particular
customer.

NOTE: Complete Symbol Trees can take up over 30 MB of disk space.

1. Create a subdirectory to store your customer symbol set. For example:

  C:\MYSYMBOLS

2. Always start with the base Windows NT version number. Copy the following
  files from the installation CD-ROM for the appropriate version:

  " XCOPY [CD Drive]\SUPPORT\DEBUG\I386 C:\MYSYMBOLS /S. " (without the
  quotation marks)

3. Copy symbols for the appropriate Service Pack binary files over your custom
  tree. Service Pack symbols can be found on the servers listed in the section
  below titled "Symbol Locations."

4. Copy any third-party patches such as Compaq SSD symbols over to your custom
  symbol tree. You may need to get these symbols from the vendor.


  NOTE: Steps 3 and 4 may need to be reversed depending on the order that they
  were installed by the customer. Match the customer's steps.

5. If the server has hotfixes installed, you need to obtain the matching symbol
  for that hotfix. If a symbol file is not provided with the hotfix, you need
  to contact Microsoft Product Support Services to inquire about the
  availability of these symbols. Copy the updated symbol over your custom
  symbol tree. Make sure that you place it in the correct subfolder (for
  example, Sys, exe, dll, etc.).


Single Processor vs. Multi Processor
------------------------------------

Windows NT uses a special kernel for SMP systems. During installation this kernel
is renamed. It is important that you also rename the SYMBOL.DBG file for
debugging.

  NTOSKRNL.EXE NTOSKRNL.DBG = Single processor NTKRNLMP.EXE. NTKRNLMP.DBG =
  Multiple processors

1. If you have a multi-processor system do the following. Under your custom
  symbol tree in \SYMBOLS\EXE there are two kernel files. Rename NTOSKRNL.DBG
  to NTOSKRNL.UNI.

2. Copy NTKRNLMP.DBG to NTOSKRNL.DBG.

Custom HAL.DLL
--------------

Some hardware platforms require a special Hardware Abstraction Layer Driver. Like
the Kernel file, the custom HAL is renamed during the installation process. Here
is a list of common HALs:

How to Determine Which HAL to Use:

During installation a text log file is created. This file can inform you about
the original name of the HAL.

1. Go to %systemroot%\REPAIR subdirectory.

2. Run ATTRIB -R -H -S SETUP.LOG to make the file visible.

3. Bring up the file in Microsoft Notepad and search for HAL.

NOTE: This same technique can be useful to verify if a special kernel is also
used.

Go to Setup HAL Symbol:

1. Go to your custom symbol tree under \SYMBOLS\DLL.

2. Rename HAL.DBG to HAL.X86.

3. Copy the "Custom HLL.DBG" to HAL.DBG.

Using Symbols in the Debugger
-----------------------------

A Windows NT Debugger, such as I386KD.EXE, looks for symbols in the following
locations:

  _NT_ALT_SYMBOL_PATH system environment variable
  _NT_SYMBOL_PATH system environment variable

These locations are set via system environment variables. They are usually
configured by a debug batch file using the SET command. The _NT_ALT_SYMBOL_PATH
is optional. For example:

  set _NT_SYMBOL_PATH=K:\NT35-SP3\SYMBOLS
  set _NT_ALT_SYMBOL_PATH=c:\WINNT\SYMBOLS

NOTE: The symbols directory is the directory directly above the extension
subdirectories (that is, if the kernel symbol file, NTOSKRNL.DBG, is located at
C:\DEBUG\511\I386\SYMBOLS\EXE\NTOSKRNL.DBG. The _NT_SYMBOL_PATH should be set to
C:\DEBUG\511\I386\SYMBOLS

How to Use Paths:

A good use of these various paths is for keeping static symbol trees for each
Windows NT version. You simply point your symbol paths to each version and
Service Pack as needed. For example, for a 1057 system with SP2 installed you
could use the following:

  set _NT_ALT_SYMBOL_PATH=c:\NT351-SP2\SYMBOLS
  set _NT_SYMBOL_PATH=K:\NT351-1057\SYMBOLS

The debugger attempts to use the Service Pack symbols first. [The Service Pack
symbols do not include the base build symbols in this case, only the SP
symbols.] If the debugger does not find a particular symbol in the SP tree it
looks it up in the 1057 symbol tree.

Search Order:

The various symbol paths are searched in the order listed above. The first symbol
file with the correct name that is encountered is used. In the example above,
_NT_ALT_SYMBOL_PATH=c:\NT351-SP2\SYMBOLS is the first one searched.

Environment Variable Override:

I386KD supports a command line switch "-y" where you can specify a symbol path.
However, using this switch overrides your existing environment variables.

Change Path on the Fly:

You can change the symbol search path at any time in the debugger by issuing
"!Sympath" command. For example:

  !SYMPATH C:\SYMBOLS.

Verifying the Symbols
---------------------

!RELOAD:

Once you have gotten to the "kd&gt;" prompt for the first time, you must type
"!RELOAD". This causes the symbolic information to be reloaded and synchronized.
If you get the error "PsLoadedModuleList is NULL!", you probably have the wrong
symbols loaded. Be sure you have the correct HAL.DBG and NTOSKRNL.DBG file
installed for the computer that you are debugging.

!PROCESS:

Symbols can also be verified by typing "!PROCESS" if you get the error, "Can't
find process list head", you probably have the wrong symbols loaded.

KB:

If the Stack Trace has gaps in the function name list, this indicates that you
are missing symbols. Missing functions could also indicate a corrupt stack but
this is somewhat rare. Double check your symbols before declaring a corrupt
stack. Also, look at the return addresses on the stack. They should all be
greater than 8000000.

!SYMPATH:

Incorrect symbols can be corrected by going to another command window, copying
the correct symbols and doing a !reload on the debugger or by specifying the
correct path with !SYMPATH &lt;symbol_path&gt;.

Advanced Symbol Verification
----------------------------

Sometimes customers do not know what driver versions they have installed on their
computers. Perhaps they installed a hotfix for NTFS but they do not know which
bug number. You may need to manually determine which .DBG files are needed.

The best way to absolutely verify if target and dbg's match is to view their
check sum value. This value is stored inside the file header.

Note: To learn more about operating system file format search MSDN for "Portable
Execution File Format." The PE header contains version numbers, link date\time,
etc.

The general plan here is to first find out the check sum of the customers files
and then find a dbg file that has a matching check sum.

There are many ways to extract the chksum from the target and the dbg. If you
have access to the files, you can use the following. This example assumes you
are interested in the file NTOSKRNL.

LINK32:

This utility can be found in the NT Build subdirectory \MSTOOLS:

  LINK32.EXE -DUMP -HEADERS NTOSKRNL.EXE LINK32.EXE -DUMP -HEADERS NTOSKRNL.DBG

DUMPBIN:

This utility can be found in the Visual C bin directory:

  DUMPBIN.EXE /HEADERS NTOSKRNL.EXE DUMPBIN.EXE /HEADERS NTOSKRNL.DBG

If you are using a debugger on a system or a crash dump, you can find the
checksum of the target file by viewing the file header in memory.

1. !DRIVERS - Will give you driver base address.

2. dd baseaddr+d8 L1

Checked Versions
----------------

If you install debug checked versions of Windows NT files you need to make
special arrangements for they dbg symbol files. Some hotfix checked builds have
the symbolic information built into the target file. In these cases, just make a
copy of the file and name it *.DBG. Place the file in the normal symbol sub
directory, that is, \SYMBOLS\EXE.

All publicly released check builds have separate dbg files just like the free
releases. However, the dbg for checked and free versions are different. For
example, the MS NT DDK contains a complete checked build of NT. It also contains
a complete symbol set to go with it.

NOTE: Checked versions of the NT kernel are the same for both Multiprocessor and
Uniprocessor systems.
