SUMMARY
=======

The Visual C++ 4.x Help file gives the following incorrect information:

  If you define a keyboard shortcut for the Main editor, the shortcut will work
  no matter which editor you're using.

NOTE: To view this information, choose Finding Information, select Special
Features, and then select Customizing the Keyboard and Toolbars from Infoview.

NOTE: This line no longer appears in Visual C++ 6.0. However, the information
about keyboard shortcuts is still useful in Visual C++ 6.o.

When making custom key assignments, you should make sure the editor you're making
changes to has precedence. The editors (Main, InfoViewer, Text, Dialog, or
Image) are layered in two tiers. The Main editor has the lowest priority, and
all other editors share a higher priority. These editors are mutually exclusive
so only one editor other than Main is active at any one time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With Visual C++ 4.x, in the Customize dialog box, which is reached by clicking
Customize menu on the Tools menu, each editor in the list provides default
settings. For the editor you designate, the command shortcut key you specify
overrides any previous assignment for that key in that editor. It also overrides
any default shortcut key specified in the Main editor for that command.

For example, assign F2 to a command in the Text editor and assign F2 to a
different command in the Main editor. When the Text editor has the focus, the
Text editor functionality will be called rather than the Main editor function.

If you observe that a custom key assignment to the Main editor is failing, this
is most likely the reason. You should look in the other editors for a key
assignment using the same keys. With Visual C++ 4.0, you can view a list of all
the key assignments by clicking Keyboard on the Help menu. In Visual C++ 5.0,
click Keyboard Map from the Help menu.

The primary purpose of each editor is:

  Text         Manages, edits, and prints source files.
  Dialog       Creates or edits dialog box templates or resources
  Image        Edits bitmaps, icons, and cursors
  InfoViewer   Displays infoViewer topics such as help
  Main         Provides defaults settings that can be overridden

NOTE: The InfoViewer editor no longer exists in Visual C++ 6.0, which uses HTML
Help instead for its help system.
