The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Service packs for Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 are typically installed
only on the individual SMS 2.0 site servers. However, service packs must also be
installed on every remote SMS Administrator console for the site. Not updating
the service pack level of a remote SMS Administrator console computer may cause
inconsistencies in the performance of the console.

For example, if an SMS 2.0 site server is running Service Pack 2 and a remote
Administrator console is running Service Pack 1, Remote Control issues may
occur.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine whether a workstation that is running the SMS Administrator console
has been upgraded to the same service pack version as the SMS 2.0 site server:

1. Verify the version number on the workstation by checking the remote
  computer's registry:

  a. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

  b. Open the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Setup

  c. Check the following value:

  Value Name: Full Version
  Data Type: REG_SZ Data: 2.00.&lt;xxxx&gt;.&lt;xxxx&gt;

2. Compare the version number you find with the version number of the SMS 2.0
  site server. You can find the version number on the SMS 2.0 site server by
  using one of the following methods:

   - Click the Site Hierarchy node in the SMS Administrator console. The build
     number for each SMS site is listed in the Details pane.

   - Check the SMS 2.0 site server's local registry:

     a. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

     b. Open the following key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Setup

     c. Check the following value:

  Value Name: Full Version
  Data Type: REG_SZ Data: 2.00.&lt;xxxx&gt;.&lt;xxxx&gt;

If the remote SMS Administrator console has an earlier service pack version than
the SMS 2.0 site server, install the service pack on the remote console. You can
update the SMS Administrator console by running the Autorun.exe file on the
remote computer from the new service pack source.

NOTE: By default, when you install a service pack on an SMS 2.0 site server, the
Administrator console on the site server is automatically upgraded.
