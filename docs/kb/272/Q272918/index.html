The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
- Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article provides a general description of how to prevent the replication of
a particular attribute to Active Directory.

The Active Directory Connector (ADC) replicates entries from the Exchange Server
directory to Active Directory, from Active Directory to the Exchange Server
directory, and keeps all of these entries synchronized. To prevent the
replication of a particular attribute to Active Directory, follow the steps
outlined in the "More Information" section.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Open the Active Directory Connector snap-in in Microsoft Management Console
  (MMC).

2. Right-click Active Directory Connector Management, and then click Properties
  on the shortcut menu.

3. Click the From Exchange tab. On this tab, if you click to select the check
  box that is next to an attribute, you enable replication for that attribute;
  if you click to clear the check box next to an attribute, you disable
  replication for that attribute.

  NOTE: Use caution when you disable the replication of some attributes because
  you may disrupt the ADC.

WARNING: Using the raw mode of the Exchange Server Administrator program (admin
/r) incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall
Microsoft Windows NT Server and/or Microsoft Exchange Server. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of raw mode can be
solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.

You can test whether an attribute is being replicated to Active Directory to help
you determine if you need to disable replication. To do so:

1. Start the Exchange Server Administrator program in raw mode by typing "admin
  /r" (without the quotation marks) at a command prompt in the Exchsrvr\Bin
  folder.

2. Click the Recipients container, and then click a mailbox.

3. On the File menu, click Raw Properties.

4. In the "List Attributes of Type" list, click All.

5. In the Object Attributes box, find the attribute name of the attribute that
  you want to test for.

6. In the Edit Value field, type a number, such as "1036" (without the quotation
  marks).

7. Click Set, and then click OK.

8. To check if the attribute replicated to Active Directory, open a program such
  as ADSI Edit.

WARNING: If you use the ADSI Edit snap-in, the LDP utility, or any other LDAP
version 3 client and incorrectly modify the attributes of Active Directory
objects, you can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall
Microsoft Windows 2000 Server and/or Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect modification of
Active Directory object attributes can be solved. Modify these attributes at
your own risk.

  a. Start ADSI Users and Computers from the Administrative Tools group.

  b. Expand the Domain container.

  c. Expand the Users container.

  d. Right-click a user in the right pane, and then click Properties on the
     shortcut menu.

  e. On the Attributes tab, in the Select Property to View list, find attribute
     that you modified in step 6; its value should be 1036 (or whatever value
     you set in step 6).
