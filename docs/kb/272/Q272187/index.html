SYMPTOMS
========

When you click Forms Administrator on the Tools menu in the Microsoft Exchange
Server Administrator program to view the Organization Forms Library, you may
receive the following error message:

  One or more forms in the form library could not be loaded. The contents of
  this public folder are currently unavailable. Either the Microsoft Exchange
  Server computer servicing this public folder is down or the public folder has
  not been replicated to this site. See your administrator.

When you click OK, the Forms Administrator tool is displayed.

In addition, when you try to view the properties of an Organization Forms Library
in EFORMS REGISTRY in the Public Folder hierarchy, you may receive the following
error message:

  The contents of this public folder are currently unavailable. Either the MS
  Exchange computer servicing this public folder is down or the public folder
  has not been replicated to this site. See your administrator.

  ID no: 80004005-0507-00000000

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur in the following scenario:

- The organization is using decentralized administration between sites
  (different administrators with no trusts).

- There are multiple Organization Forms Libraries of either the same language
  or multiple languages throughout the organization.

- Local replica is not available in the site.

- Public Folder affinity is not being used.

A list of Organization Forms Libraries may be displayed in the Public Folder
hierarchy in System Folders/EFORMS REGISTRY, but you cannot view the
Organization Forms libraries in Forms Administrator.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this issue, use a centralized site to manage an Organization Forms
Library for each language that is used (one library for each language in the
organization). Also, use either of the following methods in the organization:

- Replicate each Organization Forms Library (one library for each language for
  each organization) in EFORMS REGISTRY to at least one Public Folder server in
  each site in the organization.

  -or-

- Configure Public Folder affinity to each site in the organization, and ensure
  that at least a one-way trust is configured.

For additional information about Public Folder affinity and multiple domains,
click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q229565 XADM: Public Folder Affinity and Multiple Domains

When you complete either of these methods, multiple copies of the Organization
Forms Library of the same language are not created in the organization.

NOTE: It is recommended that you carefully plan how you want to replicate the
Organization Forms Library to each site. You must consider how the client
computer uses the Organization Forms Library.
