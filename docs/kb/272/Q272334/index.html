MORE INFORMATION
================

Page xiv: Index Page Number Is Incorrect
----------------------------------------

On page xiv, change the Index page number from 873 to 871.


Pages 18 &amp; 19: Quantum Tool Not Included
----------------------------------------

Table 1-2 on pages 18 and 19 shows a list of tools for viewing Windows 2000
internals. A tool named Quantum is incorrectly listed as being included on the
CD. The Quantum tool was not included on the CD, and is not available at this
time.


Page 95: Incorrect Information Regarding PIC and APIC
-----------------------------------------------------

The experiment on page 95 contains incorrect information about viewing PIC and
APIC configurations. In the second paragraph, change:

"... so this is the I/O APIC for processor 0:"

To:
"... so this is the local APIC for processor 0:"


Page 109: Incorrect Caption In Figure 3-5
-----------------------------------------

On page 109, in Figure 3-5,

Change:
"Interrupt dispatch table"

To:
"Interrupt Request Level"


Page 180: SYS Command Does Not Write MS-DOS Boot Sectors
--------------------------------------------------------

On page 180, in the third sentence of the first full paragraph, change:

"You might have used the MS-DOS sys command to manually write MS-DOS boot sectors
to disks."

To:

"In MS-DOS, you used the format command to write boot sectors to disks."


Page 203: Recovery Console Does Not Use RC4
-------------------------------------------

The last paragraph on page 203 states that the Recovery Console (RC) uses RC4 to
hash the password a user enters and compares it with a hash in the SAM. This is
incorrect. RC hashes the password with MD5, uses the system key to encrypt the
hash with RC4, then compares the encrypted hash with the encrypted hash stored
in the SAM.

Change:
"Next, the Recovery Console (Spcmdcon.sys) locates the Administrator account
password in the SAM, and in the final authentication step, the Recovery Console
uses the RC4 hash algorithm--the same algorithm that the Windows 2000 logon
process uses--to hash the password entered and compares the hash against the
hashed password that the SAM stores."

To:
"Next, the Recovery Console (Spcmdcon.sys) takes the entered password, hashes it
with the MD5 hash algorithm (the same algorithm that the Windows 2000 logon
process uses), encrypts the hash with RC4 (Windows 2000 uses syskey encryption
to encrypt the SAM), and compares the result with the encrypted password hash
stored in the SAM."


Page 305: Error In Stage 1 In Figure 6-5
----------------------------------------

On page 305, in Figure 6-5, in the Stage 1 box,

Change:
"Open EXE and create selection object"

To:
"Open EXE and create section object"


Page 334: Error In Point 3D Of CreateThread Flow
------------------------------------------------

There is an error on page 334 in point 3D of the CreateThread flow.

Change:
"The thread's kernel stack is allocated from the nonpaged pool."

To:
"The thread's kernel stack is allocated,"


Page 335: Error In Point 6E Of CreateThread Flow
------------------------------------------------

There is an error on page 335 in point 6E of the CreateThread flow.

Change:
"Finally, the main thread begins execution in user mode at the entry point to the
image being run."

To:
"Finally, the main thread begins execution in user mode,"


Page 347: Cross Reference Is Missing Page Number
------------------------------------------------

On page 347, in the section titled "Interrupt Level vs. Priority Levels," in the
2nd sentence the cross reference "For a description of how Windows 2000 uses
interrupt levels" should refer to page 96.

Change:
"For a description of how Windows 2000 uses interrupt levels, see page 000 in
Chapter 3."

To:
"For a description of how Windows 2000 uses interrupt levels, see page 96 in
Chapter 3."


Page 842: Applications Can Manage QoS, Not Use
----------------------------------------------

The third paragraph on page 842 states that applications with administrator
privileges can use QoS (Quality of Service). This is incorrect.

Change:
"(Only applications with administrative privileges can use QoS.)"

To:
"(Only applications with administrative privileges can manage QoS.)"


CD-ROM: LiveKd Will Not Run From The CD
---------------------------------------

The Readme.txt included on the CD-ROM that accompanies this book indicates that
the LiveKd program will run from the CD. However, it will not.

You will need to copy the program to your hard drive for it to work properly.
