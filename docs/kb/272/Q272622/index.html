-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
- Microsoft Access 2000 Service Release 1 (SR-1) 
- The DAO SDK, versions 3.5, 3.51, 3.6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The intrinsic DAO data control in Visual Basic 5.0 cannot be bound directly to a
Microsoft Access 2000 table. The known workaround to address this limitation is
to assign a DAO 3.6 recordset object to its Recordset property at run time with
Visual Basic code. The Refresh method of the intrinsic DAO data control is
commonly used to refresh the bound recordset to reflect the current data in the
database. In Visual Basic 5.0, if you attempt to run the Refresh method of the
DAO Data control when it is bound to a DAO 3.6 Recordset, the following error
message is generated:

  Run-time error '3343': Unrecognized Database format.

CAUSE
=====

The intrinsic DAO data control in Visual Basic 5.0 was written to use Microsoft
Jet 3.51. The use of a Refresh causes the control to close the bound recordset
and reopen it to reflect the current data. Even though it is bound to a DAO 3.6
recordset at run time, the intrinsic data control attempts to reopen the
recordset with the version of Jet for which it was designed (Jet 3.51) by virtue
of its design, which results in the specified error being generated.

RESOLUTION
==========

Requery the bound DAO 3.6 Recordset and rebind it to the intrinsic DAO data
control.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design and is only applicable to Visual Basic 5.0 and all of
its service packs up to SP3. SP3 was the last service pack released for Visual
Basic 5.0. This behavior does not occur in Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic 5.0.

2. On the Project menu, select References, and then set a reference to the
  Microsoft DAO 3.6 Object Library.

3. Drag and drop an intrinsic DAO data control, a text box, and a command button
  onto Form1.

4. Set the caption of the command button to Refresh DataControl and change its
  name to cmdRefresh.

5. Specify Data1 (the intrinsic data control) as the DataSource of the text box.

6. Copy and paste the following Visual Basic code into the form module. This
  sample uses data in the Nwind.mdb sample Access 2000 database. Change the
  database name, SQL query, and bound column name to point to one of your
  Access 2000 databases if you do not have a copy of Nwind.mdb:

  Dim db As DAO.Database
  Dim rs As DAO.Recordset

  Private Sub cmdRefresh_Click()
  Data1.Refresh
  End Sub

  Private Sub Form_Load()
  Set db = OpenDatabase("d:\nwind.mdb")
  Set rs = db.OpenRecordset("Select * from Customers", dbOpenDynaset)

  Set Data1.Recordset = rs
  Text1.DataField = "CompanyName"
  End Sub

7. Save the project and run it. Note that the intrinsic DAO data control is
  bound to the DAO 3.6 recordset, and that the text box displays the value in
  the specified bound column from the first record.

8. Click Refresh DataControl to execute the Refresh method of the intrinsic data
  control, and note that the specified error message is generated:

  Run-time error '3343': Unrecognized Database format.

9. Replace the code in the cmdRefresh_Click() event procedure with the following
  three statements:

  rs.Requery
  Set Data1.Recordset = rs
  Data1.UpdateControls

10. Run the project, click Refresh DataControl, and note that the error message
  is not generated.

You can test the effect of the requery and rebind of the source DAO 3.6 recordset
by the Visual Basic form if you make a change to the data in the table with
Microsoft Access, and then click Refresh DataControl on the form to refresh the
bound recordset.
