SUMMARY
=======

When you use Windows 2000 Terminal Services with a Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
client computer, client-side drive redirection is not available by default.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To use client-side drive redirection, use one of the following methods:

- Use the Drive Share utility from the Microsoft Windows 2000 Resource Kit. You
  can download the Drive Share utility from the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.windows2000.com

For additional information about the Drive Share utility, click the article

  Q244725 Using Drive Share with Terminal Services

- Use the net use command with a persistent switch to redirect or map a
  client's local drive so that it can be used in a Terminal Services session.
  To do this, follow these steps:

  1. Share the drive on the client computer that is to be mapped. For example,
     to redirect drive A, start Windows Explorer, right-click Drive A, click
     Sharing, and then click "Share this folder".

  2. From the client computer, establish a session with the Terminal Services
     server.

  3. Open a Cmd.exe prompt and type the following syntax to map the drive:

  net use &lt;driveletter&gt;: \\&lt;clientname&gt;\&lt;sharename&gt;
  /persistent:yes

  where &lt;driveletter&gt; is the drive letter that you want to use for
  redirection, and &lt;sharename&gt; is what the drive was shared out as on the
  client computer. You need to run this command only once in the session. After
  that, every time the connection is made, the drive is mapped.

For example, to map the drive C on the client workstation to the drive X in the
Terminal Services client session, following these steps:

1. Share drive C on the client as "C".

2. Connect to the Terminal Services server, and in the session, open a Cmd.exe
  prompt.

3. Type "net use X: \\&lt;clientname&gt;\C /persistent:yes" (without the
  quotation marks)

You should now see drive X in Windows Explorer.

If a session originates from one client computer, when the session is
disconnected, and then reconnected from a different computer, redirection does
not take place in the new session.

If different users log on to the Terminal Services server from the same
workstation, place the net use command listed in step three (without the
/persistent:yes switch) in a logon script.

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection must be initiated before you attempt
drive redirection. Drive redirection does not work through an Internet
connection.
