SYMPTOMS
========

You export a certificate from a computer that is running either Internet
Information Server 4.0 or Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 and then
import the certificate on a computer with IIS 5.0. The import succeeds, but you
are not able to connect, and in the browser you may receive the "No Server or
DNS" error message. In the event log you may receive the following error
message:

  Event Type: Error
  Event Source: Schannel
  Event Category: None
  Event ID: 36871
  Date: 4/26/2000
  Time: 11:17:34 AM
  User: N/A
  Computer: WEBSERVER2
  Description: A fatal error occurred while creating an SSL server credential.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows 2000. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q260910 How to Obtain the Latest Windows 2000 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date       Time       Version         Size   File name    Platform
  ------------------------------------------------------------------
  05/02/2000 12:34:58PM 5.131.2195.2079 466,704 crypt32.dll x86


NOTE: To effectively correct this problem, follow these steps:

In this scenario, Server A currently houses all certificates and is used as the
export server (this can be a Microsoft Windows NT or Windows 2000 server).
Server B is the failing import server that has certificates that have been
imported from Server A.

NOTE: Server A and Server B can be the same computer.

1. Remove all certificates from Server B that exist from the failed import. This
  includes certificates that are located in the "Trusted Root", "Intermediate",
  and "Personal" certificate stores.

2. Apply the hotfix to Server A.

3. Apply the hotfix to Server B.

4. On Server A, use the MMC Certificates snap-in to export the certificate. When
  you export a certificate for use on another computer, always select the
  following options and remember the password:

   - Yes, Export the private key

   - Personal Information Exchange - PKCS #12 (.PFX)

   - Include all certificates in the certification path if possible

NOTE: Do not select Require Stong Encryption.

5. On Server B, import the certificate into the appropriate "Local Computer"
  certificate store (Trusted Root, Intermediate, or Personal) and test Secure
  Sockets Layer (SSL).

NOTE: If you apply the High Encryption Pack to the installation, you must apply
this hotfix after you install Windows 2000 Service Pack 1.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Windows 2000 Service Pack 2.

To receive the hotfix without applying SP2, contact Microsoft Product Support
Services.
