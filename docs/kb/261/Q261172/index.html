-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
- Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An Extended Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI) program
implements the IMAPIAdviseSink interface to be notified on changes in a folder
on an Exchange Server. When an fnevObjectDeleted notification event is received,
the entry ID contained in the accompanying OBJECT_NOTIFICATION structure is a
short term entry ID instead of a long term entry ID.

CAUSE
=====

All entry IDs that are returned by the Exchange providers in notifications are
short term, because short term entry IDs are quicker to compute than long term
entry IDs.

RESOLUTION
==========

This is only a problem if you are storing the long term entry IDs of items in
another database and need information from the delete event to determine which
item to remove. Because the item has already been deleted, it cannot be opened
to obtain the long term entry ID. At this point, there is no way, other than
rescanning the folder, to identify the deleted item.

If the notification is table-based instead of folder-based, a TABLE_NOTIFICATION
structure is returned. This structure contains enough information to identify
which row of the table was deleted. For most client applications, this is
sufficient to maintain a list of items that are currently in a container.

In general, however, MAPI notification is not a recommended method of
synchronizing databases with Exchange. Notifications are not guaranteed by
Exchange and may be dropped under high loads.

REFERENCES
==========

For more information on the Exchange notification queue, see "The Queue of
Notifications" at the following Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) Web site:

  (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?URL=/library/psdk/exchserv/infostor_0jcj.htm)

Exchange 2000 supports Store Event Sinks, which can be used to track saves and
deletes to any folder in an Exchange 2000 store. For more information, see "Web
Storage System Events" at the following MSDN Web site:
