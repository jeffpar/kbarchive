The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Even though messages are flowing, the Internet Mail Service queue levels may
rise steadily during the day, with no indication that any errors have occurred.
These same queues may clear out overnight, but they fill again the next day.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when messages are being created faster than they can be
sent. If a business processes a large number of messages, its connection can
outpace the available bandwidth. If this is the cause of this behavior in your
particular scenario, the message backlog should begin to clear shortly after the
time of day that most of your users log off.

In certain cases, such as with companies that have 24-hour business schedules,
the queues may never clear; they can continue to build and can eventually create
drive-space errors or other related errors.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, increase either your connection speed, the number of
available connections, the number of Internet Mail Service connectors, or your
bandwidth.

Additional query words: bandwidth, transfer rate,
