The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Host Security Domain Wizard, the following error message may
occur:

  Host Security is not installed on &lt;Computer_Name&gt;. Please run Host
  Security Setup on &lt;Computer_Name&gt; before using the wizard.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Host Account Synchronization Service (SNAHOSTPROCESS) was not installed
during the SNA Server setup process.

RESOLUTION
==========

Run the SNA Server Setup program, and choose to install the SNA Host Account
Synchronization Service.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, the SNA Host Account Synchronization option is not selected during
the SNA Server setup process. This service is required if the following are
true:

- You want to use the Host Security Domain Wizard for creating a Host Security
  Domain.
- You are using password synchronization.

The SNA Host Account Synchronization Service is not necessary if you plan to use
Single Sign-On (SSO) with manual password updates. If manual password updates
are only going to be used, you do not need to install this service; however, you
will be unable to use the wizard when you configure your Host Security Domain.

An alternative to using the Host Security Domain Wizard is made possible by using
the Insert option when you configure a Host Security Domain; however, other
steps are also required. For additional information, click the article number
