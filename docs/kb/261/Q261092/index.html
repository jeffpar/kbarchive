SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how enterprise administrators can set granular security
permissions on Exchange Server directory objects to ensure that enterprise and
local administrators have the appropriate security access in an organization.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By setting granular security, you can allow local administrators access to only
the server-level directory objects and allow enterprise administrators full
access to all of the directory objects in the organization.

In traditional configurations, you might configure an Exchange Administrator
group that has the Permissions Admin role at the organization, site, and
configuration levels. This group represents the enterprise administrators of the
organization. However, this particular configuration does not provide any
granular directory object access for the local administrators.

For example, if you have five enterprise administrators who are responsible for
supporting the organization at a global level and you also have individual local
administrators who are responsible for only their server's directory objects in
a particular site, you need to ensure that the local administrators have
directory object access to only the appropriate servers. To do so, you need to
set appropriate permissions that the site and server directory objects inherit.

To set the appropriate permissions:

1. At the server for which the local administrator or administrative group needs
  full access, open the properties of the server's directory object.

2. Click the Permissions tab, and then add that user or group as Permissions
  Admin.

  NOTE: Ensure that you click the appropriate directory object (for example,
  under the &lt;organization&gt; container, the &lt;site&gt; container, and the
  Servers container, click the &lt;server name&gt; object and just not the
  Servers container) before you perform step 2. If you select the Servers
  container in step 1 and then perform step 2, you grant the accounts
  Permissions Admin role to all of the servers in that site.

3. Open the properties of the site-level directory object.

4. Click the Permissions tab, and then add that user or group as Permissions
  Admin.

After you perform these steps, the local administrator or administrative group
has access to not only the site folders, but also to their server properties.
Additionally, the local administrator or administrative group cannot gain access
to other server objects in the site. Enterprise administrators should already be
established with organization-level, site-level, and server-level Permissions
Admin roles.

When you establish the preceding permissions, note that enterprise administrators
have full access to change the properties attributes of all system folders.
However, you can configure more granular permissions with this approach,
depending on your particular needs.

As with any security implementation, if you change your environment settings, you
may impact more then one area. You need to plan and test when you apply
permission changes for your organization.
