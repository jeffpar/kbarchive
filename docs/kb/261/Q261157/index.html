If this does not resolve this issue, then continue with the next steps.

Troubleshoot the CD-ROM
-----------------------

Clean the program CD-ROM. To do this, use a CD-ROM cleaning kit, or gently wipe
the silver side of the CD-ROM with a soft, lint-free cotton cloth from the
center of the CD-ROM outward.

NOTE: Do not use paper cloth which can scratch the plastic and leave streaks, and
do not use a circular motion when you wipe the CD-ROM.

If the issue continues to occur, clean the CD-ROM with a damp cloth or a
commercial CD cleaning solution. Dry the CD-ROM thoroughly before you insert it
into the CD-ROM drive.
