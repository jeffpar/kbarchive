The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you prepare your Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 hierarchy for an
upgrade to SMS 2.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2), you may need to apply two specific
updates to every SMS 2.0 site server in your existing hierarchy. Please review
this article thoroughly to determine which updates you need to apply to your
hierarchy.

There are separate versions of these updates based on the version of SMS 2.0 that
each site is currently running. There are two updates for SMS 2.0 (build 1239),
and two updates for SMS 2.0 Service Pack 1 (build 1380) sites. These updates are
included on the SP2 CD-ROM in the Smsqfe folder. The updates are also included
in the Web patch download, and are available as separate downloads as noted in
the Knowledge Base articles that are referenced in the "More Information"
section of this article.

NOTE: You can obtain SMS 2.0 SP2 at the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/smsmgmt

MORE INFORMATION
================

You need to apply these hotfixes to your SMS hierarchy if your hierarchy
consists of multiple sites managing logon points in the same domain. You must
implement these hotfixes before upgrading any of your sites to SP2. Note that
there are two sets of hotfixes. There is one set for sites that are running SMS
2.0 (build 1239), and one set for sites that are running SMS 2.0 SP1 (build
1380).

If you do not apply these updates, SMS clients may not function properly because
of different versions of the client components. This condition may cause a
situation in which the base components are installed by SP2 while the optional
components are still at an SP1 level. This may cause the client to enter an
unmanageable state. If this occurs, you may have to reinstall the SMS client
software on the affected computers to correct this condition.

NOTE: After you apply either the Q251070 (release) or Q249077 (SP1) update, you
must wait until the Copylog.tcf file is updated on each Logon Point before
installing SP2. This file is located in the Smslogon\Config folder on each
domain controller. The Senior Site configured in the hierarchy should update
this file on an all shared Logon Points. For a description of the Senior Site
concept, please review the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

If the site is running SMS 2.0 without SP1 (build 1239), view the following

  Point

  Q252718 CCM Avoids Installation Attempts on SP2 Clients

SMS 2.0 SP1
-----------

If the site is running SMS 2.0 with SP1 (build 1380), view the following
Microsoft Knowledge Base articles:

  Point
