that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot

  the Windows Start menu.

5. In the Open box, type "Regedt32.exe" (without the quotation marks) and then
  click OK.

6. Find the following Windows Registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Shared Tools\Proofing Tools

7. On the Security menu, click Permissions.

8. On the Security tab, under Name, click to select the group to whom you want
  to grant permissions to access the Alki Proofing Tools. For example, click to
  select the Everyone group.
