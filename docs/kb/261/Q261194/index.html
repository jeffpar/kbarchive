SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start the Web service, the following error message occurs:

  Address already in use.

Also, the event log contains the following:

  Event 115
  Source: w3svc
  Description: Could not bind instance &lt;X&gt;

CAUSE
=====

Another service or application is listening to or using one of the default TCP
ports (80 for http connections, 443 for https connections) that the World Wide
Web Publishing Service (W3SVC) needs to bind to.

RESOLUTION
==========

Disable or uninstall the service or application that is using port 80 or 443,
and then retest the Web sites. An example of an application that could have
grabbed port 80 is MSProxy or some third party application.

In Microsoft Windows XP you can determine the application that is using the port
attempting to be used. To do this, issue the following command:

  "netstat -ano" (without the quotation marks)

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine which ports are being listened to by other services or
applications, first stop the IISADMIN service, and then type "netstat -an"
(without the quotation marks) at the command prompt.

NOTE: If this error message occurs immediately after you install IIS 5.0 over IIS
4.0, removing and then reinstalling the TCP/IP protocol from Windows may reset
the TCP port registry entries to the default values, allowing the IIS 5.0 Web
service to work again. However, be aware that doing so may prevent the other
service or application using port 80 or 443 from operating properly.
