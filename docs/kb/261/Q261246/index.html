MORE INFORMATION
================

Sms20info.exe is a utility that gathers the following information from a 2.0
Site Server running Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 or Microsoft Windows 2000:

- Creates SMSINFO_[Sitecode] directory on the "c:" drive to store retrieved
  information

- Creates WINMSD report for Site Server

- Dumps SMS Registry Key

- Creates SMS\Inboxes directory summary

- Creates SMS\Bin\ directory summary

- Copies all Logs from \SMS\Logs directory

- Stops and Starts WMI service on Site Server

- Launches Microsoft Internet Explorer and points it to the Microsoft File
  Exchange (MSFE) server to upload the gathered information and files
  (optional)

To extract and install the SMS 2.0 Supportability Files, run Support.exe.

Note: Administrative rights on the targeted Site Server are required when you run
this utility. Write access to the location from which this utility is run is
also required.

Currently this utility does not produce a WINMSD report for a Windows 2000 Site
Server if it is run on Windows NT 4.0.
