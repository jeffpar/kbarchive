The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the versions of Microsoft Exchange Server listed at the beginning of this
article, you may experience some or all of the following symptoms:

- Mail backs up between one of the servers in a site and all of the other
  servers in the site.

- Numerous instances of the following warning event may be logged:

  Event ID: 9318
  Source: MSExchangeMTA
  Type: Warning
  Category: Interface Description
  An RPC communications error occurred.
  Unable to bind over RPC. The locality table (LTAB) index is 76.
  Windows NT error code: 1722. [BASE IL MAIN BASE 1 500] (12)

- If you ping by IP, the ping is successful.

- If you ping by server name, the ping may be successful at times and
  unsuccessful at other times.

- RPC ping does not work in one direction. It works from the answering server,
  but it does not work from the calling server to the answering server.

- If you restart the server, you temporarily resolve the issue. However, after
  a period of time, mail flow stops again on the server.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if there are two Domain Name System (DNS) servers
selected in the TCP/IP stack on the server, and the second DNS server points to
a server that is still on the network, but which is no longer being used for DNS
purposes. When, because of network problems, the server selects the secondary
DNS setting, name resolution no longer occurs and connectivity is lost.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Right-click Network Neighborhood on the desktop, and then select Properties.

2. Click the Protocols tab, select TCP/IP Protocol, and then click Properties.

3. Click the DNS tab, and then in the "DNS Service Search Order "box, verify
  whether the IP addresses for the DNS servers listed are accurate. If an
  address is incorrect, click the Edit button to change the incorrect address
  to the correct address. If the address is valid but the server is no longer
  being used for DNS, click the Remove button to delete the entry.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, restart the server to force the DNS information to
read into memory from the first DNS server in the list. This strategy is a
temporary workaround until the next network failure.
