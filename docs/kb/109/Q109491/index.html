SUMMARY
=======

The following information was taken from the Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11 SYSINI.WRI.

MORE INFORMATION

SYSTEM.INI File Settings
______________________________________________________
Windows initialization files contain information that defines your
Windows environment. Windows for Workgroups and Windows-based
applications can use the information stored in these files to make
their configurations meet your needs and preferences.

There are two standard Windows initialization files:

- WIN.INI, which primarily contains settings that Windows for
  Workgroups maintains to customize your Windows for Workgroups
  environment according to your preferences.

- SYSTEM.INI, which primarily contains settings that customize
  Windows for Workgroups to meet your system's hardware needs.

This document describes only a few of the settings in the SYSTEM.INI
file. You can get a more complete listing of the SYSTEM.INI settings
by purchasing the Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit. The Resource
Kit provides complete technical information about Windows for
Workgroups for the support professional. It includes a technical
reference manual and a disk containing helpful utilities, system
resource-viewers, drivers, and accessories.

To order the Resource Kit within the United States, dial:

1-800-642-7676

To order outside of the United States, dial the phone number for your
area. You can find this number on the International Subsidiary card.

Format of the SYSTEM.INI File

The SYSTEM.INI file contains several sections, each of which consists
of a group of related settings. The sections and settings are listed
in the SYSTEM.INI file in the following format:

[section name]
SettingName=value

In this example, [section name] is the name of a section. The
enclosing brackets ([ ]) are required, and the left bracket must be
in the leftmost column on the screen.

The SettingName=value statement defines the value of each setting. A
setting name consists of any combination of letters and digits in
uppercase or lowercase, and it must be followed immediately by an
equal sign (=). The value of the setting can be an integer, a letter,
a Boolean value, a string, or a quoted string, depending on the
setting. Most sections contain multiple settings.

You can include comments in initialization files. You must begin each
line of a comment with a semicolon (;).

How to Read the Listings in This Document

In this document, settings in the SYSTEM.INI file are listed
alphabetically within each section. However, the settings do not
appear alphabetically in the SYSTEM.INI file. To change a setting,
you need to search for it in the appropriate section of the
SYSTEM.INI file.

The syntax, default value, and purpose of each setting appear in the
following format.
____________________________________________________________
SettingName=&lt;value&gt;

Default:     The Windows for Workgroups default value for this
setting or the value that is used if the setting is not present in
your SYSTEM.INI file.
Purpose:     The function of the setting.

&lt;value&gt; indicates whether the value should be an integer, a letter, a
range of numbers, a Boolean value, or something else. If you want to
enable a Boolean setting, you can set the value to True, Yes, On, or
1. If you want to disable the Boolean setting, you can set the value
to False, No, Off, or 0.
____________________________________________________________

Changing Settings

When the Setup program creates the SYSTEM.INI file, it assigns
default values to many of the settings. Other settings have values
that correspond to the type of hardware you are using.

Some settings listed in this document do not usually appear in your
SYSTEM.INI file. Most of these settings have a built-in default value
that is present whether or not the setting appears in your SYSTEM.INI
file. You might need to change one or more of these values to improve
the performance of Windows for Workgroups or applications with your
system.

To change the values of the settings described in  "[Network] Section
Settings" in this document, use the Network Setup icon the in Network
group, or the Network icon in Control Panel. For more information
about changing your network settings, see Help for Windows Setup and
Chapter 8, "Customizing Network Settings and Improving Performance,"
in the Microsoft Workgroup Add-on User's Guide.

To change the values of the rest of the settings described in this
document, open the SYSTEM.INI file and edit it by using a text
editor, such as Notepad. Do not use a formatting editor, such as
Write or a word processor in document mode; it can corrupt your
SYSTEM.INI file. For more information on how to use Notepad, see Help
for Notepad.

Any changes you make to your SYSTEM.INI file settings do not take
effect until you restart Windows for Workgroups.

Caution:  Do not change any settings that are not described in this
document. If you need to change additional settings, refer to the
Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit. Always back up your SYSTEM.INI
file before you change any of its settings. That way, you can restore
the original file if you make incorrect changes. Be careful when you
make changes to the SYSTEM.INI file. Your system will not work
properly if you edit this file incorrectly.

[boot] Section Settings

All settings in this section, except for CachedFileHandles, are
required. If you modify or delete one of these settings, Windows for
Workgroups might not work properly. There are no specific default
values for these settings; Setup assigns values based on your system
configuration.

If you want to run a different application when you start Windows for
Workgroups, change the following setting:
____________________________________________________________
shell=&lt;filename&gt;

Default:     None (Setup initializes this value as PROGMAN.EXE.)
Purpose:     Specifies the application that runs when you start
Windows for Workgroups. Unless you change this setting, Program
Manager runs when you start Windows for Workgroups. For example, if
you want to run File Manager instead of Program Manager, you could
change this setting as follows:

shell=winfile.exe
____________________________________________________________

[Network] Section Settings

The [Network] section contains settings that affect how your computer
interacts with the network. You can change most of these settings by
using either the Network icon in Control Panel or the Network Setup
in the Network group. However, to change some settings, you must edit
the SYSTEM.INI file. It is recommended that you use Control Panel or
Windows Setup whenever possible to change the settings. For more
information about customizing how your computer interacts with the
network, see Chapter 8, "Customizing Network Settings and Improving
Performance," in the Microsoft Workgroup Add-on User's Guide and Help
for Windows Setup.

The [Network] section can contain the following settings:
____________________________________________________________
AuditEvents=&lt;hexadecimal number&gt;

Default:     0
Purpose:     Specifies which networking events are recorded, or
audited, in an event log.
____________________________________________________________
AuditEnabled=&lt;0-or-1&gt;

Default:     0
Purpose:     Turns event logging on or off. If this setting is
enabled, Windows for Workgroups records network events in an event
log. If this setting is disabled, Windows for Workgroups does not log
network events.
____________________________________________________________
AuditLog=&lt;number&gt;

Default:     4
Purpose:     Specifies the size (in kilobytes) of the event log file.
____________________________________________________________
AutoLogon=&lt;boolean&gt;

Default:     Yes
Purpose:     Specifies whether you will automatically be logged on
when you start Windows for Workgroups. If this setting is disabled,
you will not be logged on. If this setting is enabled, you will be
logged on. If you are using a logon password, the logon dialog box
will appear, asking you to supply your password. To log on, you must
supply your password.
____________________________________________________________
AutoStart=&lt;full-or-basic&gt;

Default:     Basic
Purpose:     Specifies the type of redirector support that Windows
for Workgroups provides. If the value for this setting is Full,
Windows for Workgroups provides the same support as the virtual
redirector (VREDIR). If the value for this setting is Basic, Windows
for Workgroups provides limited redirector support. To change this
setting, you must use Notepad to edit the SYSTEM.INI file.
____________________________________________________________
CacheThisPassword=&lt;boolean&gt;

Default:     None
Purpose:     Determines whether the Save This Password In Your
Password List check box in the Enter Password or LAN Manager dialog
box is selected the next time the dialog box is displayed. If this
setting is enabled, the check box is selected. If this setting is
disabled, the check box is not selected. When you select or clear the
check box, the value for this setting changes in the SYSTEM.INI file
to reflect the current state of the check box.
____________________________________________________________
Comment=&lt;string-of-characters&gt;

Default:     None
Purpose:     Provides a description of your computer. This
description appears next to your computer name in the Connect Network
Drive and Connect Network Printer dialog boxes. The comment value
cannot contain commas.
____________________________________________________________
ComputerName=&lt;name&gt;

Default:     The name you provided for your computer during Setup.
Purpose:     Specifies the name of your computer. Your computer
name must be unique, can be up to 15 characters long, and can contain
letters, numbers, and any of the following characters:

! # $ % &amp; (  ) - . @ ^ _ ' { } ~

Your computer name appears in the Connect Network Drive, Connect
Network Printers, and Select Computer dialog boxes.
____________________________________________________________
EnableSharing=&lt;0-or-1&gt;

Default:     1
Purpose: Turns sharing on or off by controlling whether Windows for
Workgroups loads the VSERVER.386 device driver at startup. This
setting is controlled by the FileSharing= and PrintSharing= settings.
If either of these settings is set to 1, then EnableSharing is set to
1. If both of these settings are set to 0, then EnableSharing is set
to 0.

____________________________________________________________
Exclude=&lt;lana number, lana number&gt;

Default:     None
Purpose:     Specifies that Windows for Workgroups should not use
the protocols represented by the LANA numbers assigned to this
setting. This setting overrides the LANAs= setting. If you are using
Novell NetWare NetBIOS, you will need to exclude it by using this
setting. For more information, see the NETWORKS.WRI online document.
____________________________________________________________
FileSharing=&lt;boolean&gt;

Default:     1
Purpose:     Turns file sharing on or off. If this setting is
enabled, you can use the File Manager to share files and directories.
If this setting is disabled, you cannot share files and directories.

Note:  If your Network Administrator has disabled file sharing, this
switch will have no effect.
____________________________________________________________
KeepConn=&lt;seconds&gt;

Default:     600
Purpose:     Specifies the number of seconds Windows for
Workgroups should wait before disconnecting an implicit connection
that is no longer being used. This is useful if you are performing
several directory searches or lists using an implicit connection, or
if you are performing several tasks that involve pipes. If the
applications that you are using to perform these tasks run slowly,
then increase this value. Otherwise, you should never need to change
this setting.
____________________________________________________________
LANAs=&lt;lana number, lana number&gt;

Default:     None
Purpose:     Overrides the automatic detection of protocols, if
you start the network before starting Windows for Workgroups, and
specifies that Windows for Workgroups should use only those protocols
represented by the LANA numbers assigned to this setting.
____________________________________________________________
LMAnnounce=&lt;yes-or-no&gt;

Default:     No
Purpose:     Enables or disables Windows NT or LAN Manager
compatibility in the browser on your computer. If your workgroup
includes computers or servers that are running Windows NT or LAN
Manager, set this value to Yes.
____________________________________________________________
LMLogon=&lt;0-or-1&gt;

Default:     0
Purpose:     Specifies whether you log on to a Windows NT or LAN
Manager domain when you start Windows for Workgroups. If this value
is set to 1 and you have stored the domain password in your password
list, Windows for Workgroups logs you on to a Windows NT or LAN
Manager domain and runs your logon script, if you have one. If the
domain password is not in your password list, the LAN Manager Logon
dialog box appears so that you can pick the domain you want to log on
to and specify the password for that domain. If this value is set to
0, you will not log on to a Windows NT or LAN Manager domain.
____________________________________________________________
LogonDomain=&lt;domain name&gt;

Default:     The workgroup your computer belongs to.
Purpose:     Specifies the name of the default Windows NT or LAN
Manager domain (workgroup) that validates your password, if you
choose to log on to a Windows NT or LAN Manager domain when you start
Windows for Workgroups.
____________________________________________________________
LogonValidated=&lt;boolean&gt;

Default:     No
Purpose:     Specifies the value of the LMLogon setting when you
last logged on. If you decide to change the LMLogon value by
selecting or clearing the Log On To Windows NT or LAN Manager Domain
check box in Control Panel while you are still logged on, the
LogonValidated setting ensures that you are logged off properly when
you end your Windows for Workgroups session, or if you choose to log
off by using Control Panel. You should never need to change this
setting.
