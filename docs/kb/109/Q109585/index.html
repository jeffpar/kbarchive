Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.


After you download ATTMAIL.EXE to a clean directory, run it (by typing "attmail"
(without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt) to extract the contents of
the file. You should receive the following files:

  ATTMAIL.DLL (215,760 bytes, dated 12-15-93, 1:36 P.M.)
  README.TXT

To update your ATTMAIL.DLL file
-------------------------------

1. Verify that the AT&amp;T Mail driver is the current driver in the Mail System
  Selector (MAILDRV.EXE) by running the Mail System Selector from Program
  Manager, selecting AT&amp;T Mail, and choosing Set As Current Mail Driver.

2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

  " copy &lt;path&gt;:\attmail.dll &lt;destination&gt; " (without the quotation
  marks)

  where &lt;path&gt; is the drive and directory where you ran the self-
  extracting ATTMAIL.EXE file and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and
  directory where your ATTMAIL.DLL file currently resides. For example, if you
  ran the self-extracting file from the TEST directory on drive D, and your
  ATTMAIL.DLL file is located in the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory on drive C,
  type the following command:

  " copy d:\test\attmail.dll c:\windows\system " (without the quotation marks)
