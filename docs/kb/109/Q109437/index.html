The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.1, 3.5, 3.51 
- Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1

This article details moving the workgroup postoffice (WGPO) and changing
the workgroup Postoffice Manager.

Windows NT 4.0:
---------------

Mail system in Windows NT 4.0 now is called Windows Messaging. The registry
entries are completely different and therefore the suggestion in this
article is not applicable anymore.

Moving the Workgroup Postoffice
-------------------------------

To move the workgroup postoffice, do the following:

1. Be sure that the new directory is shared with full access.

2. Use File Manager to move the WGPO to its new location; be sure to move all
  subdirectories.

3. Run REGEDT32.EXE.

  WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system- wide
  problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them.
  Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of
  Registry Editor can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

4. Select the following subkey:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Mail\Microsoft Mail

5. Double-click the ServerPath entry.

6. Change the String to reflect the new WGPO location.

NOTE: For each Windows for Workgroups user, edit the MSMAIL.INI file to
change the ServerPath= line so that it points to the new WGPO location.

Changing the Workgroup Postoffice Manager
-----------------------------------------

To change the name of the existing Postoffice Manager without moving the
Postoffice Manager functionality to another machine, select the Mail
option, then select Postoffice Manager and edit the details of the existing
Postoffice Manager account.

To move the Postoffice Manager functionality to another machine, do the
following:

1. Run REGEDT32 and open the Registry Key
  \HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Mail\Custom Commands.

2. From the Registry menu, select Save Key and using a valid filename, save the
  key to a floppy disk so that you can use it later when establishing the
  Admin2 account.

3. From Admin1's machine, log on to Mail, and from the Mail menu, choose
  Postoffice Manager.

4. Select the Details option, and write down the required information for Admin1
  and Admin2 (obtain the password from the administrators; passwords don't
  appear in the Details dialog box).

5. If Admin1 no longer needs a mail account, delete the user account for Admin2
  and edit the details of the Admin1 account so that it matches the new
  Postoffice Administrators account (Admin2) and go to step 9.

6. On Admin1's machine, open the Registry key
  \HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Mail\Custom Commands.

7. Delete the WGPOMgr1 and WGPOMgr2 entries. Select the entry to delete, choose
  Delete from the Edit menu, and then choose the Yes Button.

8. On Admin1's machine, choose Exit And Sign Out from the File menu of Mail.

9. On Admin2's machine (if you haven't already done so, choose Exit And Sign
  Out), open the Registry key \HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Mail\Custom
  Commands.

  NOTE: Make sure you have Custom Commands highlighted or the following steps
  will be in error.

10. From the Registry menu, select Restore and, selecting the filename used
  above, choose the OK button, and then choose the Yes button in the Warning
  dialog box.

11. Start Mail using the new Admin name and password (these may be the same as
  the original).

  NOTE: A message may appear that states mail was unable to find your .MMF
  file. A dialog box then appears that displays the .MMF file that was
  detected. Select the .MMF file that was detected. Select the .MMF file and
  choose OK to select the MMF file found on the hard disk drive.

12. Select the Mail option to verify the Postoffice Administrator option is now
  available on Admin2's machine.

To change the default user name in the Mail logon dialog box, do the
following:

1. Run REGEDT32 and open the Registry Key
  \HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Mail\Microsoft Mail.

2. Double-click the Login entry.

3. Change the string to reflect the desired user name.
