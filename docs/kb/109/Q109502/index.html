1.0  Running Windows for Workgroups with an Operating System Other
Than the Microsoft MS-DOS Operating System

Microsoft Windows for Workgroups and MS-DOS work together as an
integrated system. They were designed together and extensively tested
together on a wide variety of computers and hardware configurations.
Running Windows for Workgroups with an operating system other than
MS-DOS could cause unexpected results or poor performance, and is not
supported by Microsoft.

2.0  Preventing Stack Overflow

Stacks are temporary data structures that MS-DOS and applications use
for processing hardware events. If, while setting up Windows for
Workgroups, the Setup program detects hardware or software that
requires a certain stack size, Setup places the following command
line in your CONFIG.SYS file:

stacks=9,256

This should be sufficient most of the time. However, if you receive
the "Internal Stack Overflow" message, first try increasing the
second number on the stacks= command line. If that doesn't work, try
increasing the first number. For more information about the stacks
setting and modifying the CONFIG.SYS file, see your MS-DOS
documentation.

3.0  Using 32-Bit Disk Access and File Access

This section includes information about using 32-bit disk access and
file access with portable computers, DoubleSpace,
and networks.

3.1  Using 32-Bit Disk Access with Portable Computers

By default, 32-bit disk access is turned off to prevent disk errors
on some battery-powered portable computers. However, 32-bit disk
access may run correctly with some battery-powered portable
computers, such as the Zenith MasterSport SL. If you want to try
using 32-bit disk access, select the Use 32-bit Disk Access check box
in the expanded Virtual Memory dialog box (choose the Enhanced option
in Control Panel). For more information, see Chapter 8, "Customizing
Network Settings and Improving Performance," in the Microsoft
Workgroup Add-On "User's Guide."

Caution: Before you use 32-bit disk access on a battery-powered
portable computer, it is highly recommended that you back up your
hard disk. Because 32-bit disk access has not been fully tested on
all battery-powered systems, you may receive disk errors while using
it.

3.2  Using 32-Bit File Access with DoubleSpace

You cannot use 32-bit file access with MS-DOS version 6.0 if you have
DoubleSpace enabled. To use 32-bit file access with DoubleSpace, use
MS-DOS version 6.2.

3.3  Networks You Cannot Use 32-Bit File Access With

A driver that is necessary for 32-bit file access is incompatible
with some networks, including Artisoft LANtastic and Microsoft LAN
Manager.

If you are running one of these networks with Windows for Workgroups
instead of the Microsoft Windows Network, remove the
device=c:\windows\ifshlp.sys line from your CONFIG.SYS file. Then
turn off 32-bit file access by using the Enhanced icon in Control
Panel.

If you remove the IFSHLP.SYS device driver line from CONFIG.SYS, you
will not be able to share files or printers. You may also not be able
to use 32-bit disk access.

4.0  Using Memory Managers and Vshare

This section describes problems you may encounter while using memory
managers and the VSHARE.386 file-sharing/file-locking program with
Windows for Workgroups.

4.1  Using 386MAX

If you are running 386MAX with Windows for Workgroups, note the following:

- Do not use options that limit the EMS swap region in the upper
  memory area. If you include exclude= options on the 386max or bluemax
  command line or in the .PRO file (usually called 386MAX.PRO), make
  sure that the address range specified does not extend beyond A000. If
  the address range extends beyond A000, Windows for Workgroups may not
  run properly.

  For example, the command exclude=1800-A000 is acceptable, but the
  command exclude=1800-B800 is not. If you must exclude an address
  range above A000, use the RAM= option instead. For more information
  about this and other options, see your 386MAX documentation.

- Do not load SMARTDrive when QCache is running.

  Note: The 386MAX setup program does not detect SMARTDrive version 5.0
  and may recommend that you install QCache.

- If you update an earlier version of 386MAX to version 6.0, the
  386MAX version 6.0 setup program may not remove the load=windows.lod
  line from your .PRO file. You can remove this line manually. It is
  not needed, and removing it will free a small amount of memory.

- If you remove the net start command line from your AUTOEXEC.BAT
  file, Windows may lock up during startup.

4.2  Turning On Sharing Popup with Vshare

VSHARE.386 is a file-sharing and file-locking program that is used
when running Windows for Workgroups with file or print sharing
enabled. With VSHARE, when a file-sharing violation occurs, you see
an "Access denied" message, instead of the "Sharing violation on
drive..." message used when file and print sharing are not enabled.

Some MS-DOS-based applications may need the sharing-violation
message. If you need to turn on this message, add the following line
to the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI file:

EnableSharingPopups=TRUE

For more information about modifying the SYSTEM.INI file, see the
SYSINI.WRI online document.

4.3  If EMM386 Detects an Error in an Application

If EMM386 displays a message such as "EMM386 has detected error #12
in an application," this indicates that the processor has reported an
exception error to EMM386. An exception error typically occurs when
an application gives the processor an instruction under invalid or
unexpected conditions. In most cases, these errors are related to a
specific program. If you are receiving an error that does not occur
with any particular application, the error might be caused by a
device driver or a memory-resident (terminate-and-stay-resident)
program.

To avoid these errors:

- Try to identify the program involved. One way to do this is to see
  if the error occurs when the program is not running.  If you suspect
  a memory-resident program or device driver, try bypassing it when
  your computer starts.

- Try disabling EMM386. If a particular application is to blame,
  disabling EMM386 might allow that application to generate an error
  message. Disabling EMM386 might also change your memory configuration
  so that the error no longer occurs.

  Since most of Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 and most Windows
  applications use protected-mode memory, and EMM386 manages
  conventional memory, EMM386 may not save any memory.

- Try changing the order in which you load device drivers and
  memory-resident programs. This might help because some errors occur
  only under specific memory conditions.

- If error 12 is occurring, this indicates that a stack is being used
  incorrectly. Try adding the following command to your CONFIG.SYS
  file:

     STACKS=18,512

- If error 13 is occurring, the program may be trying to use
  protected mode without cooperating with EMM386. You may need to
  obtain a VCPI-compliant version of the program, or not load EMM386
  when using this application.

5.0  Using Advanced Power Management (APM)

Windows for Workgroups includes support for Advanced Power Management
(APM). This enables Windows to extend battery life, display
power-status information, and work with the suspend features of
battery-powered personal computers. To find out if your computer
supports APM, contact your computer manufacturer.

To install APM on your system:

1. Quit Windows for Workgroups.

2. Run Windows for Workgroups Setup and select one of the following
  system types:

  - MS-DOS System with APM
  - Intel 386SL Based System with APM (if your computer has an Intel
    386SL processor and supports the SL Enhanced Options for APM)

3. Restart Windows for Workgroups.

  A Power icon appears in the Control Panel window.

4. Choose the Power icon to configure power-management settings.

For more information about the settings, choose the Help button or
press F1 while using the Power Management dialog box.
