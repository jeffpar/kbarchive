The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following information was taken from the Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
version 3.11 SYSINI.WRI, and begins with the continuation of [network] section
settings.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MaintainServerList=&lt;yes-no-auto&gt;

Default:     Auto
Purpose:     Specifies whether the browser on your computer acts
as the browse master or a back-up browse master. If the value for
this setting is Auto, the browser on your computer will act as
either, as needed. If the value for this setting is No, the browser
will never act as a browse master or a back-up browse master. If the
value for this setting is Yes, the browser will always act as both.
If you are setting up a computer as a dedicated server for a small
workgroup of three to four computers, you may want to set this value
to Yes on the server and to No on the other computers. Otherwise, you
should never need to change this value.
____________________________________________________________
MultiNet=&lt;name&gt;

Default:     None
Purpose:     Specifies the other networks you have added support for.
____________________________________________________________
NoProtocolErrMsg=&lt;0-or-1&gt;

Default:     0
Purpose:     If your computer is a portable which usually connects
to your network by using its docking station, then whenever the
computer is not connected to its docking station, you will receive
error messages when you start Windows for Workgroups 3.11. Since this
situation does not really indicate a networking problem, you can use
this setting to prevent one of the error messages from appearing.

    If value for this setting is 0, the error message controlled
by this setting will appear. If the value for this setting is 1, the
error message will never appear.
____________________________________________________________
PreferredRedir=&lt;full-or-basic&gt;

Default:     Basic
Purpose:     Specifies whether the net start command loads the
full real-mode network drivers, which provide full network
functionality including browsing, or the basic real-mode network
drivers, which provide only limited functionality.
____________________________________________________________
PrintBufTime=&lt;seconds&gt;

Default:     45
Purpose:     Specifies the number of seconds of idle printing time
that Windows for Workgroups should wait before indicating that the
end of a print job has been reached when printing from an
MS-DOS?based application. When printing to a network printer from an
MS-DOS?based application, your documents do not start printing until
the application finishes processing the print job. If you are using
an MS-DOS?based application that processes print jobs quickly and you
want your documents to print sooner, decrease this value. If you are
using an MS-DOS?based application that takes longer to process print
jobs or if your documents are not printing continuously, increase
this value. The time during which an MS-DOS?based application is
suspended is not counted.
____________________________________________________________
PrintSharing=&lt;boolean&gt;

Default:     1
Purpose:     Turns print sharing on or off. If this setting is
enabled, you can use the Print Manager to share printers over the
network. If this setting is disabled, you cannot share printers.

Note:  If your Network Administrator has disabled print sharing, this
switch will have no effect.
____________________________________________________________
Priority=&lt;number&gt;

Default:     80
Purpose:     Specifies the priority given to running your
applications and sharing your resources. The lower the number, the
faster your applications run. The higher the number, the faster your
resources are shared. The value for this setting must be between 40
and 9000.
____________________________________________________________
Reconnect=&lt;boolean&gt;

Default:     Yes
Purpose:     Determines whether the Reconnect At Startup check box
in the Connect Network Drive or Connect Network Printer dialog box is
selected the next time the dialog box is displayed. If this setting
is enabled, the check box is selected. If this setting is disabled,
the check box is not selected. When you select or clear the check
box, the value for this setting changes in the SYSTEM.INI file to
reflect its current state.
____________________________________________________________
Reshare=&lt;boolean&gt;

Default:     Yes
Purpose:     Determines whether the Reshare At Startup check box
in the Share Directory or Share Printer dialog box is selected the
next time the dialog box is displayed. If this setting is enabled,
the check box is selected. If this setting is disabled, the check box
is not selected. When you select or clear the check box, the value
for this setting changes in the SYSTEM.INI file to reflect its
current state.
____________________________________________________________
Username=&lt;name&gt;

Default:     Your computer name until you log on for the first
time. Then the default value becomes the logon name you specify in
the Welcome To Windows For Workgroups dialog box.
Purpose:     Specifies the default logon name used to log on to
Windows for Workgroups. The value for this setting changes to the
logon name you specify when you log on to Windows for Workgroups.
____________________________________________________________
WinShare=&lt;path&gt;

Default:     None
Purpose:     Specifies a remoteWindows directory. This is useful
if you are running a shared copy of Windows from a network server.
The network path specified here is the path that contains the shared
copy of Windows. The WinShare parameter prevents the specified
network connection from disconnecting while Windows is running.
____________________________________________________________
WorkGroup=&lt;name&gt;

Default:     The workgroup you specified during Setup.
Purpose:     Specifies the workgroup your computer belongs to. If
this setting is missing from your SYSTEM.INI file, the Windows for
Workgroups redirector will not load and you will not have full
networking capabilities.
____________________________________________________________

[Network Drivers] Section Settings

The [Network Drivers] section contains information used for running
the real-mode network drivers to connect to the network.

The [Network Drivers] section can contain the following settings:
____________________________________________________________
DevDir=&lt;path&gt;

Default:     c:\windows
Purpose:     Specifies the location of the PROTOCOL.INI file and
the real-mode drivers necessary to connect to the network. The
necessary drivers are determined by the netcard= and transport=
entries in this section.
____________________________________________________________
LoadRMDrivers=&lt;yes-or-no&gt;

Default:     None
Purpose:     Specifies whether the net start command loads real
mode drivers.
____________________________________________________________
NetCard=&lt;list-of-filenames&gt;

Default:     None (Setup sets this value to match your configuration.)
Purpose:     Specifies the real-mode driver(s) for your network
adapter. This is loaded by the net initialize command, by the net
start command (if LoadRMDrivers=yes), or by the net start workstation
command.
____________________________________________________________
Transport=&lt;list-of-filenames&gt;

Default:     None (Setup sets this value to match your configuration.)
Purpose:     Specifies the network-protocol real-mode-driver
file(s) that Windows for Workgroups uses. This is loaded by the net
start command (if LoadRMDrivers=yes), or by the net start workstation
command.
____________________________________________________________

[Password List] Section Settings

The [Password List] section contains settings that specify the
location of the password-list files for each user who logs on to your
computer. The password-list file contains a list of the passwords you
use to connect to password-protected resources.

The [Password List] section can contain one or more occurrences of
the following setting:
____________________________________________________________
&lt;username&gt;=&lt;drive&gt;&lt;directory&gt;&lt;password-list-filename&gt;

Purpose:     Username specifies the logon name of the user; drive
specifies the drive the password-list file is located on; directory
specifies the name of the directory in which the password-list file
is located; and password-list-filename specifies the name of the
password-list file.
____________________________________________________________

[NonWindowsApp] Section Settings

The [NonWindowsApp] section contains settings that affect the
performance of MS-DOS?based applications.

The [NonWindowsApp] section can contain the following settings:
____________________________________________________________
CommandEnvSize=&lt;bytes&gt;

Default:     0 for MS-DOS versions earlier than 3.2. Otherwise,
the default is the value for the /e: option in the shell= command
line in the CONFIG.SYS file.
Purpose:     Specifies the size of the COMMAND.COM environment.
Note that running batch files with the extension .BAT starts
COMMAND.COM, so this setting also applies to batch files. The value
for this setting must be either 0 or between 160 and 32768. A value
of 0 disables this setting. If the value is too small or too large,
it will be rounded up to 160 or down to 32768. If the value is less
than the current size of the actual environment, this setting will be
disabled, as if it were set to 0. If you have specified the
environment size in a PIF file for COMMAND.COM, the PIF-file setting
overrides this setting.
____________________________________________________________
DisablePositionSave=&lt;0-or-1&gt;

Default:     0
Purpose:     When this setting is disabled, the position and fonts
used by an MS-DOS?based application are saved in the DOSAPP.INI file
when you quit the application. If this setting is enabled, the
position and fonts used by an MS-DOS?based application whose settings
have not been previously saved in the DOSAPP.INI file will not be
saved. If enabled, the setting can be overridden for each
MS-DOS?based application by selecting the Save Settings On Exit check
box in the Font Selection dialog box in the application.
____________________________________________________________
FontChangeEnable=&lt;0-or-1&gt;

Default:     1 on systems that use Windows version 3.1 or Windows
for Workgroups grabbers. 0 on systems that use Windows version 3.0
grabbers.
Purpose:     Enables you to change fonts when you are running an
MS-DOS?based application in a window on a system that uses version
3.0 grabbers (usually used in 3.0 display drivers). Windows version
3.1 video grabbers (used in 3.1 display drivers) include built-in
support for changing fonts when you are running an MS-DOS?based
application in a window. If you are using a 3.0 grabber that has not
been updated to include the ability to change fonts and you want to
use this feature, enable this setting. However, with this setting
enabled, your screen may lose characters and the cursor may change
size and position slightly.
____________________________________________________________
LocalTSRs=&lt;list-of-TSR-applications&gt;

Default:     DOSEDIT, CED
Purpose:     Specifies which terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR)
programs work properly if they are copied to each instance of a
virtual machine. When you start Windows for Workgroups, it detects
any TSR programs that are currently running. If the TSR is on the
LocalTSRs list, Windows for Workgroups copies the TSR to each virtual
machine you run. Many TSRs will not run properly if they are added to
this list. Make sure your TSR is fully compatible with Windows for
Workgroups and can be copied to a virtual machine before you add it
to the list.
____________________________________________________________
MouseInDosBox=&lt;0-or-1&gt;

Default:     1 if an MS-DOS mouse driver is loaded that has the
extension .COM or .SYS and supports the use of a mouse with an
MS-DOS?based application. Otherwise, the default is 0.
Purpose:     Specifies whether the mouse is supported when running
an MS-DOS?based application in a window. Mouse support for an
MS-DOS?based application running in a window is automatically
available if you are using a Windows version 3.1 grabber. If you are
using a Windows version 3.0 grabber and you want mouse support,
enable this setting. If you do not want mouse support, disable this
setting.
____________________________________________________________
NetAsynchSwitching=&lt;0-or-1&gt;

Default:     0, unless an application is running that supports the
use of the Task Switcher API by the NetBIOS.
Purpose:     Specifies whether you can switch away from an
application after it has made an asynchronous network BIOS call. If
this setting is disabled, you cannot switch away. Switching away from
some applications that make these calls might cause your system to
fail. After Windows for Workgroups detects an asynchronous NetBIOS
call, you cannot switch away from the application, even if no more of
these calls are made. Enable this setting only if you are sure that
the applications you use will not receive network messages while they
are inactive.
____________________________________________________________
ScreenLines=&lt;number&gt;

Default:     25
Purpose:     Specifies the number of lines that will be displayed
on the screen when you run an MS-DOS?based application. An
application that specifies a different screen mode can override this
setting.
____________________________________________________________
SwapDisk=&lt;drive:directory&gt;

Default:     The directory that the TEMP environment variable
points to; if there is no TEMP variable, the default is the root
directory of your first hard drive (usually drive C). If you do not
have a hard disk, the default is the root directory of your first
floppy disk drive (usually drive A).
Purpose:     Provides the name of the disk drive and directory to
which Windows for Workgroups swaps MS-DOS?based applications.
____________________________________________________________

[standard] Section Settings

Windows for Workgroups 3.11 no longer runs in standard mode. It
therefore does not use any settings in the [standard] section.
