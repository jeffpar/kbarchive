-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are using Sound Manager 3.0, you may find that when you play QuickTime
movies in Asimov's Ultimate Robot, you can't hear the soundtrack. This problem
may occur after you have opened and exited from the Robotoid Assembly Toolkit.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Sound Manager version 3.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

RESOLUTION
==========

To regain sound in your movies, follow these steps:

1. Click on the Dialog or Credits buttons. This should cause the sound system to
  begin working again.

2. When the Dialog or Credits sounds have stopped playing, try running the
  QuickTime movie again.

The QuickTime movie should now play correctly, with sound included.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine whether or not you have Sound Manager 3.0 installed, follow these
steps:

1. Open the System Folder.

2. Open the Extensions Folder.

3. Look for a file named Sound Manager. Click on it and choose Get Info from the
  File menu.

The info screen will list the file's version.

Using this method, you can see if you have Sound Manager installed and determine
whether or not it is version 3.0.
