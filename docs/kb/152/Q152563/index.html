SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to back up and restore files with Microsoft Backup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To back up files, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to
  System Tools, and then click Backup.

  NOTE: For information about how to install Backup, please see the following
  article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152561 How to Install Microsoft Backup

2. Click the Backup tab.

3. Create a backup set. A backup set is an index of the files you plan to back
  up. The first time you run Backup, a Full System Backup Set is created. This
  set includes every file on your hard disk.

  NOTE: If you have the original installation disks for the programs you use, it
  is usually not necessary to back up your programs. Instead, back up only the
  documents you have created.

  To create a smaller set of selected files, use the Select Files To Backup
  window. In this window, each drive, folder, and file has a check box next to
  it. If a check appears in a check box, the file, the contents of the folder,
  or the contents of the drive will be backed up. If a check appears in a check
  box with a dark background, some items, but not everything, in the folder or
  drive will be backed up.

4. Click Next Step.

5. In the "Select a destination for the backup" window, click the destination
  for the backup.

  If you have a supported tape backup drive that is detected by Backup, it
  appears at the bottom of the "Select a destination for the backup" window. If
  you do not have a tape drive, or your tape drive is not supported or
  detected, you can select a floppy disk drive or a location on your hard
  disk.

  NOTE: You can also back up your files to a network drive. The easiest way to
  accomplish this is to map a drive letter to the network destination to which
  you want to back up your files. If you have mapped a drive letter to a
  network drive, Backup displays it in the "Select a destination for the
  backup" window.

6. Click Start Backup. If you have created a new backup set, you are prompted to
  name the new backup set. Backup informs you when the backup operation is
  finished.

To restore files, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to
  System Tools, and then click Backup.

2. Click the Restore tab.

3. In the Restore From window, click the drive or folder where the backup is
  stored.

4. In the Backup Set window, click the backup set you want to restore, and then
  click Next Step.

5. Click the check boxes of the files you want to restore so that a check
  appears in the check box. Clear the check boxes for files you do not want to
  restore.

6. Click Start Restore. Backup informs you when the backup operation is
  finished.

NOTE: If you receive an error message while you are restoring files, Backup
displays a log showing where the error occurred. For information about how to
troubleshoot this problem, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
