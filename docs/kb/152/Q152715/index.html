-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

A new version (1.0b) of Remote Data Objects version 1.0 is now available for
downloading. This version is a maintenance release that fixes a few key bugs
that were reported by customers over the last few months. The new version number
of this file is 1.0.3329.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use the following instructions to install RDO 1.0b:

1. Visual Basic version 4.0a must be installed on your system.

  To obtain Visual Basic 4.0a, please call 1(800)360-7561. Although this release
  is free to all registered users, there is a $5 charge to cover shipping and
  handling. This is only a component release and not a new release of Visual
  Basic 4.0 itself.

2. An existing version of Msrdo32.dll must reside on your system.

3. Obtain the new version of Msrdo32.dll. (See the MORE INFORMATION section
  below for information on how to obtain RDO version 1.0b.)

4. Copy the new version of Msrdo32.dll over the existing copy. For example,
  execute the following command:

  copy a:\msrdo32.dll c:\windows\system32

The new version has no new features and is backwards-binary compatible with the
current RDO 1.0a version. This new version consists of bug fixes only.

The following is a list of the bugs that were fixed in version 1.0b:

- Fixed memory leak in the GetRows method.

- Fixed support for using query parameters of binary data type (SQL_BINARY and
  SQL_VARBINARY).

- Fixed storage problems associated with query parameters of smallint data
  type.

- Fixed a problem with passing byte arrays to AppendChunk where last byte was
  not copied.

- Fixed a stack problem where the error description returned from an ODBC error
  or RAISERROR statement was greater than 255 characters.

- Fixed condition where update failed if the only column changed was a BLOB
  data type.

- Fixed condition where PercentPosition returned a divide by zero error.
