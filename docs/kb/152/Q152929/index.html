-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

WordPad might crash and you might not be able to set up a profile for the
Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client if you have just upgraded a non- English
version of Windows NT from 3.51 to 4.0.

CAUSE
=====

The Richedit control is used in both WordPad and the Microsoft Exchange client.
It reads the font substitution information from the registry. The font
substitution information can be in two forms. Windows NT 3.51 used a simplified
form (since it didn't support multiple code pages), Arial CE=Arial. Windows NT
4.0 (like Windows 95) has the character set numbers included in the font
substitutions, Arial CE,238=Arial,238

In the past (Windows NT 3.51 and Windows 95), we had either form 1 or form 2, but
not both. When Windows NT 3.51 is updated to 4.0, it preserves the old settings
and adds the new ones, thus both forms of substitution strings are now present.
The RichEdit control was not designed to handle both forms at the same time.

WORKAROUND
==========

Since the bugs happens due to the old (Windows NT 3.51) font substitution
strings, removing these strings from the registry eliminates the cause of the
bug. To remove these strings, follow these steps:

1. Start Regedt32.exe.

2. Go to

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT
                    \CurrentVersion\FontSubstitutes

3. Remove all 'type 1' font substitutions that deal with CE, Cyr, and Greek
  fonts and do not have charset numbers.

  For example, remove:

     Arial Greek:Arial

  but leave:

     Arial Greek,161:Arial,161

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange clients,
version 4.0, listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected
in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S. Service Pack 4. For information on
obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
