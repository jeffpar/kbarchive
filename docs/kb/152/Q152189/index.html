SUMMARY
=======

This article provides a description of Magic School Bus Explores the Ocean.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A trip to the beach can be oceans of fun, especially when you're traveling with
the Friz, that daring teacher with the crazy clothes who can make anything
happen. This time she's got a notion to jump in the ocean. So come explore the
Coral Reef, the Open Ocean, and more, as you go on a treasure hunt that will
challenge your head as well as your flippers.

Travel through the seven ocean environments in a bus that's "morphed" into a
submarine. While you're exploring the ocean environments, be sure not to miss
the exciting games and activities in each zone. Whenever you start something
new, the Friz or one of your classmates will be right there to help you.

When you get to a new place, don't forget to go to the back of the bus and check
out the reports. While you're reviewing the reports, keep in mind that your
information hunt is also a treasure hunt.

To win the Treasure Hunt Game, you've got to uncover the hidden treasure. To
locate the treasure, you need to look for clues. The Friz will give you the
first of three clues at the Sandy Beach. Each clue tells you what you need to do
to find the next one.

When you arrive at the place where the treasure is hidden, you'll find a treasure
scanner you can use to uncover your prize. So use your mind, and the treasure
you will find.

When you've found the treasure, you've won.

The Magic School Bus Explores the Ocean is designed for kids of all ages,
especially those ages 6-10. The program is based on a series of books from
Scholastic publishing, one of the leading publishers of kids books.

NOTE: The Magic School Bus Explores the Ocean does not ship with a passport
showing where the users has traveled.
