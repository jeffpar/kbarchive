  Q187549 Microsoft Fax Does Not Appear in Add/Remove Programs

Installing Microsoft Fax
------------------------

To use Microsoft Fax, you must add the Microsoft Fax information service to a
Microsoft Exchange profile. Before you can add the Microsoft Fax information
service to a Microsoft Exchange profile, the Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft
Fax components and a fax modem must already be installed in Windows 95.

If the Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Fax components are not already installed
in Windows 95, follow these steps to install them:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs.

2. Click the Windows Setup tab, click the Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Fax
  check boxes to select them, and then click OK.

3. Proceed through the Inbox Setup Wizard, click Finish, and then click Yes to
  restart your computer if you are prompted to do so.

NOTE: If you have not already installed a modem in Windows 95, the Inbox Setup
Wizard automatically starts the Install New Modem Wizard. To install a modem,
verify that the "Don't detect my modem; I will select it from a list" check box
is not selected, click Next, proceed through the Install New Modem Wizard, and
then click Finish.

Adding Microsoft Fax to a Microsoft Exchange Profile
----------------------------------------------------

If the Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Fax components and a fax modem have
already been installed in Windows 95, you can add the Microsoft Fax information
service to the Microsoft Exchange profile you want to use to send faxes by
following the steps in the appropriate section below:

Adding Microsoft Fax to an Existing Microsoft Exchange Profile:

1. Quit Microsoft Exchange if it is running.

2. In Control Panel, double-click Mail And Fax.

3. If the profile you want to use to send faxes is not the default profile,
  click Show Profiles, click the profile you want to use to send faxes, and
  then click Properties. If the profile you want to use to send faxes is the
  default profile, skip to step 4.

4. On the Services tab, click Add, click Microsoft Fax in the list of available
  information services, click OK, and then click Yes in the dialog box that
  appears.

5. Click the User tab, type your name in the Your Full Name box, and then type
  your area code and fax number in the Fax Number boxes.

Adding Microsoft Fax to a New Microsoft Exchange Profile:

1. Quit Microsoft Exchange if it is running.

2. In Control Panel, double-click Mail And Fax.

3. Click Show Profiles, and then click Add to start the Inbox Setup Wizard.

4. Follow the instructions on the screen to add Microsoft Fax.

Wizard from Microsoft Exchange, or another program. To send a fax using the
Compose New Fax Wizard, follow these steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to
  Fax, and then click Compose New Fax.

2. Proceed through the Compose New Fax Wizard, and then click Finish.

To send a fax from Microsoft Exchange, follow these steps:

2. Proceed through the Compose New Fax Wizard, and then click Finish.

To send a fax from a program whose File menu contains a Send command, follow
these steps:

1. Create or open the document you want to send in the program that you want to
  use to send the fax.

2. On the File menu, click Send.

3. On the Tools menu, click Fax Addressing Wizard.

4. Proceed through the Fax Addressing Wizard, and then click Finish.

5. Type a subject for the fax, and then type any message text that you want to
  include.

6. On the File menu, click Send.

follow these steps:

1. Create or open the document you want to send in the program that you want to
  use to send the fax.

2. On the File menu, click Print.

3. Choose Microsoft Fax from the list of printers, and then click OK.

  box, type your calling card number in the Calling Card Number box, and then
  click OK.

Troubleshooting Microsoft Fax
-----------------------------

Troubleshooting Sending Faxes:

If you are unable to send faxes using Microsoft Fax, use the following steps to
troubleshoot the problem. After performing each step, check to see if the issue
has been resolved.

1. If you normally use the Compose New Fax wizard to send a fax, try sending the
  fax using one-off addressing instead. To do so, create a new message in
  Microsoft Exchange and use the following address syntax on the To line:

     [fax:username@9999999]

  To create a new message in Microsoft Exchange, double-click the Inbox icon on
  the desktop to start Microsoft Exchange, and then click New Message on the
  Compose menu.

2. Verify that the Outbox is empty. If the Outbox is not empty, empty it by
  deleting any messages it contains, or by moving the messages to a different
  folder.

  If you are unable to delete or move messages in the Outbox, delete the
  messages manually by deleting all files in the Windows\Spool\Fax folder.

3. Create a new Microsoft Exchange profile that contains only the Microsoft Fax
  information service. To do so, follow these steps:

  NOTE: These steps should be performed even if the Microsoft Exchange profile
  that you currently use to send faxes contains only the Microsoft Fax
  information service.

  a. In Control Panel, double-click Mail And Fax.

  b. Click Show Profiles, and then click Add. Verify that the Microsoft Fax
     check box is selected, click any other information service check boxes
     that are listed to clear them, and then click Next.

  c. Proceed through the remainder of the Inbox Setup Wizard, and then click
     Finish.

  If you have more than one Microsoft Exchange profile, you can configure
  Microsoft Exchange to prompt you for the profile to use each time you start
  it. To do so, follow these steps:

  a. In Microsoft Exchange, click Options on the Tools menu, and then click the
     General tab.

  b. In the When Starting Microsoft Exchange area, click "Prompt for a profile
     to be used," and then click OK.

  c. On the File menu, click Exit And Log Off.

  d. Restart Microsoft Exchange.

4. Remove and reinstall Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Fax. To do so, follow
  these steps:

  a. Quit Microsoft Exchange if it is running.

  b. In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs.

  c. Click the Windows Setup tab, and then click the Microsoft Exchange check
     box to clear it. When you are prompted to remove Microsoft Fax or any
     other components that require Microsoft Exchange, do so.

  d. Click OK.

  e. When you are prompted to restart your computer, click Yes.

  f. In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs.

  g. Click the Windows Setup tab, and then click the Microsoft Exchange and
     Microsoft Fax check boxes to select them. If you also removed other
     components, click the check boxes for those components to select them
     also.

  h. Click OK and then proceed through the Inbox Setup Wizard to create a
     Microsoft Exchange profile that contains only the Microsoft Fax
     information service.

Troubleshooting Receiving Faxes:

If you are unable to receive faxes using Microsoft Fax, use the following steps
to troubleshoot the problem. After performing each step, check to see if the
issue has been resolved.

1. Disable high-speed transmission and error correction mode. To do so, follow
  these steps:

  a. In Control Panel, double-click Mail And Fax.

  b. Click Microsoft Fax in the list of information services, and then click
     Properties.

  c. Click the Modem tab, click the fax modem that you use to receive faxes,
     and then click Properties.

  d. Click Advanced, click the Disable High Speed Transmission and Disable
     Error Correction Mode check boxes to select them, and then click OK.

2. Reduce the size of the transmit and receive buffers. To do so, follow these
  steps:

  a. In Control Panel, double-click Modems.

  b. Click the fax modem that you use to receive faxes, and then click
     Properties.

  c. Click the Connection tab, and then click Port Settings.

  d. Move the Receive Buffer and Transmit Buffer sliders one setting to the
     left (toward the Low setting), and then click OK.

  If the problem persists, repeat steps A-D and move the Receive Buffer and
  Transmit Buffer sliders one more setting to the left. Repeat this process
  until the Receive Buffer and Transmit Buffer sliders are all the way to the
  left or the problem no longer occurs.

3. Disable the Reject Pages Received With Errors option in Microsoft Fax. To do
  so, follow these steps:

  a. In Control Panel, double-click Mail And Fax.

  b. Click Microsoft Fax in the list of information services, and then click
     Properties.

  c. Click the Modem tab, click the fax modem that you use to receive faxes,
     and then click Properties.

  d. Click Advanced, click the Reject Pages Received With Errors check box to
     clear it, and then click OK.

If these steps do not correct the problem, contact the manufacturer of the modem
to inquire whether an updated modem setup information (.inf) file is available.

telephone company and request that they check your telephone line for line
noise.
