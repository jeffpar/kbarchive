SUMMARY
=======

The steps below outline the method for moving a user's mailbox and Inbox
Assistant Rules from Site 1 to Site 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Log on to the mailbox that needs to be moved.

2. Download all messages to a PST.

3. Create the mailbox in Site 2.

4. Log on to the new mailbox in Site 2 and define the moved .PST name in the
  information services for this mailbox.

  Notes:

   - Be sure you also move the Schedule+ information to a .SCD file and import
     it into the new mailbox, if necessary.

   - Also, if necessary, remove the old mailbox from Distribution Lists and add
     the new mailbox to the Distributions Lists.

5. If the new mailbox name is the same as the old mailbox name, delete the old
  mailbox. If mailbox names will be different, then leave the old mailbox in
  place with an auto forward rule to the new mailbox, and a reply to sender
  telling them to update his or her Personal Address Book. After the user has
  successfully moved and everything is working fine in the new location, you
  can safely delete the old mailbox.

Moving Inbox Assistant Rules
----------------------------

You can save the rules by copying them to a folder on a local .PST

- Select a folder where you want to copy the Inbox Assistant rules.

- Click Application Design on the Tools menu. Then select Copy Folder Design.

- Select the Inbox from your Microsoft Exchange Server mailbox.

You can reverse these steps to copy the rules back to the Inbox on the new
mailbox.

1. Select Inbox (the location where you want to copy TO).

2. Click Application Design on the Tools menu. Then select Copy Folder Design.

3. Select the new folder from your local .PST.
