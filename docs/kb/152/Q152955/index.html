-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A message is returned to sender with a Non-Delivery Report (NDR) after only one
attempt at sending from one MTA to another MTA using an X.400 connector. When
the MTA on the other side is down, the message is expected to sit in the queue
and to be retried based on the settings under Connection Retry Values on the
Override tab on the X.400 connector property pages.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs for messages sent to address spaces that have only one
possible route, but for which the connector used can be involved in multiple
routes for other address spaces. A quick test, (that is, "Does the connector
have any alternate routes?") is initially used to decide whether or not to
reroute a message. The full reroute processing for a message then uses the
actual address space of the message to determine if an alternate route is
available. (A connector may be the only route for address space X, but may be
one of many possible routes for address space Y).

During reroute processing of a message with just one possible route, the route
history is kept incorrectly. The second time the message goes through through
reroute processing it behaves as though :

- this message has just been transferred in.

- the message has already traversed the destination MTA.

The "Routing loop prevention" function then prevents the message from being
routed to the destination MTA; no other routes are available and so the message
is returned with an NDR.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Exchange Service
Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the following word
