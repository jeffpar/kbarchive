SUMMARY
=======

This article provides a description of Magic School Bus Explores the Solar
System.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Imagine going on a nice trip to the planetarium and having the bus you're riding
in "morph" into a rocket ship that's headed straight for outer space, and then
losing your teacher without a clue as to where she might be.

No lie, with the Friz, this stuff happens. So get ready for the ride of your
life.

Yes, you are lost in the Solar System; your only hope of escape lies in your
ability to win games, where you win tokens for the Friz Finder.

Some of your classmates have written reports about the Solar System and there are
some very cool fact sheets and science experiments, too.

When you get to each planet surface, click on the WhatsIt to play the games. Win
the game and you get a token for the Friz Finder. Use the Friz Finder to get up
to three hints about which planet she is located on. When you think you've
figured out which planet she's on, go to that planet and use the Friz Finder to
see if you're right.

When you've found the Friz, you've won.

The Magic School Bus Explores the Solar System is designed for kids of all ages,
especially those 6-10. The program is based on a series of books from Scholastic
publishing, one of the leading publishers of kids books. In addition to the
books, MSB Solar is also being marketed in conjunction with a Magic School Bus
animated series on PBS and McDonald's Happy Meals.
