SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the 4 millimeter DAT device driver, if you are using a Digital
Equipment TLZ06 4MM DAT tape drive, you may receive the following error in the
event log:

  Event ID: 7026
  Source: Service Control Manager
  Description: The following boot-start or system-start driver(s) failed
  to load:

            4mmdat.sys

Some models of the Digital Equipment TLZ06 4MM DAT tape drives contain a new
firmware version which is not recognized by the Windows NT 4mmdat.sys device
driver.

CAUSE
=====

The identifier string embedded in the tape drive's firmware was changed to read
DEC TLZ6, but the 4mmdat.sys device driver is looking for a string of DEC
TLZ06--this difference in identifier strings prevents the driver from
recognizing the tape drive.

To verify that this is the problem, use Registry Editor to look at the firmware's
identifier string as follows:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE)

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE window, go to the following key:

  \Hardware\Devicemap\SCSI\SCSIport(x)\ScsiBus(Y)\Target(z)

  where x= the scsiport number that the tape drive is attached
  where y= the scsibus number that the tape drive is attached
  where z= the scsi I.D. number that the tape drive is configured for.

3. Look at the identifier value found under the tape drive's target(z) number.
  If the identifier string does not read:

  DEC TLZ06

  but instead reads DEC TLZ6, this is the cause of the device driver failure.


STATUS
======
