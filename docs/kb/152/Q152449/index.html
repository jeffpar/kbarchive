SYMPTOMS
========

If the import file for Directory Import includes some double-byte characters,
the Directory Import command in the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program may
fail to create the mailbox correctly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

  S E R V P A C K

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the

MORE INFORMATION
================

Directory Import divides the import file into several pages to read it. The page
size is 4 KB on an x86 processor. When the import file includes double -byte
characters and its boundary is at the point of a multiple of 4 KB, Directory
Import may not work correctly.

In other words, when the lead byte of the double-byte character is at the
4,096-byte point and the trail byte is at the 4,097-byte point, this problem may
occur.

Three kinds of phenomena have been confirmed:

- All mailboxes after 4 KB are not imported.

- Only the mailbox that includes 4-KB point is not imported.

- All attributes after 4 KB are out of order.
