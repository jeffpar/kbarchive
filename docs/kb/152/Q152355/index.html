<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Article: Q152355
Product(s): Microsoft FoxPro
Version(s): WINDOWS:3.0,3.0b

Last Modified: 15-DEC-1999

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Setup Wizard in Visual FoxPro allows the user to insert a "\" in the icon
file description that will cause an error during installation of the executable.
The error "Setup Error 279 object 243" is received shortly after the
installation process begins followed by a message that indicates the
installation did not succeed.

CAUSE
=====

Setup Error 279 Object 243 is received in Win95 during setup. The user is then
notified that setup was not successful and installation is exited.

Other characters like "*", "&lt;", "&gt;", "?", and "|" will produce the same
error. These are characters that are not allowed in file names under 8.3 DOS
naming conventions.

WORKAROUND
==========

The workaround is to run the Setup Wizard again and remove the "\" from the name
of the icon file.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a project and put an icon file in the distribution directory.

2. From the Tools menu, select Wizards, and then choose Setup.

3. In Step 6 of the Setup Wizard, select the PM Item for the icon file and, in
  the description, enter a "/" character. For the Command line, type:

  " %s\name.exe " (without the quotation marks)

  where "name" is the name of the executable.

4. Select Finish, and run the Setup.exe file that is created.
