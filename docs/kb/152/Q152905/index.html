-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 Service Packs 1, 2 
- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade from the Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 3.x to the
Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 95, if the Microsoft Exchange client for
Windows 3.x was included in the Startup group, you might receive the following
error when you manually start the client from the Startup group or when the
client starts automatically at system start up:

  Upload of offline changes could not be completed. The client operation
  failed.

On computers with low amounts of available memory, you might receive an "Out of
memory" error instead of the error listed above.

MORE INFORMATION
================

These errors occur when the Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 95 has been
installed in the Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 3.x subdirectory. By
default, both will attempt to install in the C:\Exchange directory. The
Microsoft Exchange client for Windows 95 Setup program detects the existing
subdirectory and will prompt you to install the Microsoft Exchange client for
Windows 95 in the same subdirectory. However, it will not replace all of the
existing files. In addition, it will not detect the presence of the Microsoft
Exchange client icon in the Startup group so this icon will still point to
Exchng.exe instead of Exchng32.exe.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange clients,
version 4.0, listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected
in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S. Service Pack 4. For information on
obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
