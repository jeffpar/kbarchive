-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start the Microsoft Exchange client, the client may
temporarily hang or may be prompted multiple times for domain credentials. These
credentials are for the domain where the Microsoft Exchange Site that owns the
Organization Forms folder is located (for example, let's call it Site B). The
pop-up dialog box also appears when you attempt to open a read receipt, delivery
receipt, or non-delivery report.


CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. When the client logs on to Site A, there is an
attempt to locate a forms library and to bind to it if it exists within the
Microsoft Exchange Organization. If the only instance of the Forms Library
exists in Site B and affinity is set, then the Microsoft Exchange client will
attempt to connect to a Microsoft Exchange Server (containing the Forms Library)
in Site B. This may cause the following symptoms:

- Clients in Site A are slow when attempting to open a read receipt, delivery
  receipt, or non-delivery report but clients in Site B open them at normal
  speed.

  Affinity is set to Site B, but the client in Site A has no physical LAN
  connection to Servers in Site B.

- Clients in Site A and Site B are slow when attempting to open a read receipt,
  delivery receipt, or non-delivery report.

  The Server conatining the only instance of the Organization Forms folder is
  not available.

- Clients in Site A are prompted for Domain credentials but clients in Site B
  are not prompted.

  A trust does not exist between Site A NT Domain and Site B NT Domain.
  Therefore, when a Site A client attempts to access Organization Forms folder
  on a Server in Site B, it will be prompted for Domain credentials for a valid
  NT account in Site B.

IMPORTANT - If no Organization Forms folder instances are available in the Site,
but there is at least one Site available with instances, the Affinity to the
Sites is used to rank the order in which connections to the Sites will be
attempted. The affinity is set on the site Public Folder Affinity page. Clients
must have RPC connectivity to the servers in the Affinity Sites. Otherwise, the
clients will not be able to access the public folders in the other Sites, even
though the Affinity has been correctly set. Thus causing possible client slow
down.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do one of the following:

- Remove the affinity to the Site that owns the Organization Forms folder (Site
  B).

  -or-

- Create a local Site instance of the Organization Forms folder by replicating
  the folder from Site B to Site A.

If an Organizations Forms folder is created within the Organization, it is
recommended this folder is replicated to Sites that may not have a physical
connection (ie dial up connection) or are connected via slow link to the
Organization Forms folders Home Site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You will be prompted for domain credentials when all of the following conditions
are met:

- An Organization Forms Folder has been created.

- A Public Folder Affinity has been established between the sites.

- No local instance of the Organization Forms folder exists.
