This article discusses two methods to put a disk directory listing
into a string array under OS/2 protected mode. (Note: This article was
written because the FILES statement in BASIC only outputs to the
screen, not to a file or to string variables.)

Example 1 shows a simple method to SHELL to the DIR command, redirect
the output to a file, and input from the file into string variables.
(Example 1 also works correctly in MS-DOS.)

Example 2 shows how to invoke OS/2 API functions (DosFindFirst and
DosFindNext) to retrieve a disk directory into string variables.

This article applies to Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00 and
6.00b for MS-DOS and MS OS/2 and to Microsoft BASIC Professional
Development System (PDS) Version 7.00 for MS-DOS and MS OS/2.

Note: In Microsoft BASIC PDS 7.00, the DIR$ function can be used to
accomplish the same thing as these two routines show. The use of DIR$
is documented on Page 107 of the "Microsoft BASIC 7.0: Language
Reference" manual.

For an article about how to invoke MS-DOS (or OS/2 real mode)
functions to accomplish the same thing, query in this Knowledge Base
on the following keywords:

   INTERRUPT and FINDFIRST and FINDNEXT

In MS OS/2 protected mode, you can use the API CALLs DosFindFirst and
DosFindNext to retrieve a disk directory listing and load it into a
string array, as shown in Example 2 below. Example 2 does NOT apply to
QuickBASIC Versions 4.50 and earlier because they cannot compile
programs for OS/2 protected mode.

Example 1 (the simplest technique) is as follows:

' Works in QuickBASIC 2.00, 2.01, 3.00, 4.00, 4.00b, 4.50, and
' BASIC compiler 6.00 and 6.00b.
nf = 200   ' Handles directory listing up to 200 lines.
DIM buffer$(nf)
INPUT "Enter Search Path: ", path$   ' Enter path such as c:
SHELLSTRING$ = "dir " + path$ + " &gt;dirfile.dat"
SHELL SHELLSTRING$   ' SHELL to the MS-DOS DIRectory command.
OPEN "dirfile.dat" FOR INPUT AS #1
pntr% = 0
WHILE NOT EOF(1) AND pntr% &lt; nf
  pntr% = pntr% + 1
  INPUT #1, buffer$(pntr%)  ' Inputs one directory line at a time.
  PRINT buffer$(pntr%)
WEND
CLOSE #1
KILL "dirfile.dat"
END

Example 2 is as follows:

The following sample program is for MS OS/2 protected mode (to be
compiled only in BASIC compiler Version 6.00 or 6.00b in MS OS/2
protected mode or BASIC PDS Version 7.00 in MS OS/2 protected mode):
