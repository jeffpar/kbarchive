When CHAINed inside the QuickBASIC Version 4.00b or Version 4.50
editor, the following programs fail to pass the COMMON SHARED variable
m$. There are no error messages at compile time or run time. The
CHAINed program uses a period in an array name that appears to
conflict with a separate user-defined type. Neither the array nor the
user-defined type variable is passed in COMMON. The programs run
correctly in QuickBASIC Version 4.00 or when run from an .EXE program
compiled in Version 4.00b or Version 4.50.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in QuickBASIC Versions
4.00b and 4.50. This problem was corrected in the QBX.EXE environment
of the Microsoft BASIC PDS Version 7.00 (fixlist7.00).

The following is a code example:

   'The CHAINing program, PROG1.BAS:
   COMMON SHARED m$
   m$ = "Nice to see you.  Sometimes I don't print, but I should!"
   CHAIN "prog2"

   'The CHAINed-to program, PROG2.BAS:
   COMMON SHARED m$
   TYPE t
     a AS INTEGER
   END TYPE
   DIM c.n(5)    'If the period is taken out, it works correctly.
   DIM d AS t    'If this line is taken out, or if d is DIMmed to
                 'something else, it works correctly.
   PRINT m$
