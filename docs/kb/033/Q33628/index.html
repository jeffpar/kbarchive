If a program has more than 30 named COMMON blocks, it will give the
following error at LINK time:

   fatal error L1050:  too many groups in one module

The program runs correctly inside the QuickBASIC editor.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in QuickBASIC versions
3.00, 4.00, and 4.00b; in Microsoft BASIC Compiler versions 6.00 and
6.00b for MS OS/2 and MS-DOS (buglist6.00, buglist6.00b); and in
Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) versions 7.00
and 7.10 for MS OS/2 and MS-DOS (buglist7.00, buglist7.10). We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it
becomes available.

In QuickBASIC version 3.00, the error message is as follows:

   Too many GRPDEFS in one module

LINK.EXE is limited to support only 21 GRPDEF records per .OBJ module;
BASIC needs to be better optimized to produce a minimum number of
GRPDEF records per .OBJ module when using named COMMON blocks. This
feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion in a
future release.

The following code example duplicates the problem:

   COMMON SHARED /Ann/ a1
   COMMON SHARED /Brent/ a2
   COMMON SHARED /Bill/ a3
   COMMON SHARED /Darren/ a4
   COMMON SHARED /Jeff/ a5
   COMMON SHARED /Jim/ a6
   COMMON SHARED /John/ a7
   COMMON SHARED /Kyle/ a8
   COMMON SHARED /LiKai/ a9
   COMMON SHARED /Michelle/ a10
   COMMON SHARED /Mike1/ a11
   COMMON SHARED /Mike2/ a12
   COMMON SHARED /Nancy1/ a13
   COMMON SHARED /Nancy2/ a14
   COMMON SHARED /Rich/ a15
   COMMON SHARED /Sholeh/ a16
   COMMON SHARED /Teri/ a17

   PRINT "OK!"
