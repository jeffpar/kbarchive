-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Microsoft Windows NT user logs on with a Double Byte Character Set (DBCS)
user account name that contains an ending byte value that is equal to a
lowercase letter in the US English alphabet (a through z), Systems Management
Server (SMS) Advertised Programs Manager forces the creation of a folder name
with all uppercase values.

In doing so, this changes the value of the DBCS characters, which causes SMS
Advertised Programs Manager to create an incorrectly-named directory for the
user account in the windir\ms\sms\clicomp\swdist32\CAP\DOMAIN folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q288239 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Example
-------

A DBCS character with a hex value of "8F 72(r)" changes to a value of "8F 52(R)"
thereby changing the account name.

You see this behavior most often in the User&lt;site_code&gt;.lkp file between
the Client Access Point (CAP) and the client. The user's account name never
matches, and any advertisements or packages that are targeted to this user
account are not distributed to the clients.
