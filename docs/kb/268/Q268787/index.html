IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

When you configure the user and group mappings for Microsoft Windows NT Services
for UNIX, you can configure a group mapping for a group that the Microsoft
Windows NT user is not a member. This group mapping is not considered when the
system checks the access rights in the network file system (NFS) server for this
user.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Windows NT, an access token contains the security identifiers (SIDs) for the
user in addition to the SIDs of the groups to which the user belongs. In
Services for UNIX, you can configure the user and group mappings. When a group
mapping is configured and the user is not part of that group in Windows NT, this
group mapping is not considered when the system checks for file access in the
NFS server.

When a mapping of the user's UNIX group to a Windows NT group exists and there is
no user mapping, the user is, by default, mapped to the anonymous account. The
access token for this user can only contain the anonymous user's SID and the
SIDs for the groups to which the anonymous user belongs; it cannot contain the
SID for the mapped group if the user is not a member of this group.

Configuring Default User Mappings
---------------------------------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

The default user mapping can be configured using the following steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NfsSvr\Parameters

3. Select the registry key added in step 2. On the Edit menu, click Add Value,
  and then add the following value:

  Value Name: UnmappedUnixUserUsername
  Data Type: REG_SZ
  Value: NtDomain\NtUsername

NOTE: The preceding key must contain the name in the following format:
NtDomain\NtUsername or \\&lt;Machinename&gt;\&lt;NtUsername&gt;. If the
separating backslash is missing, the value is rejected.
