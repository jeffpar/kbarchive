-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2) on a
primary site, the Software Inventory Processor component may experience poor
performance when it processes software inventory data. This poor performance is
usually noticeable by observing a backlog of .sic and .sid files in the
\SMS\Inboxes\Sinv.box folder.

Also, custom queries that you create in the SMS Administrator console that use
software inventory data may take a long time to be processed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by a combination of events. If you installed the hotfix
described in Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q238762 while the site server was
running SMS 2.0 Service Pack 1 (SP1), this could result in a large number of
records in the SoftwareFile and SoftwareProduct tables in the SMS site server's
database.

For additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q238762 Software Inventory Creation Date Is Incorrect in SMS Database


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q288239 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

The SMS 2.0 SP2 Release Notes specifically state that the software inventory
tables should be truncated before you apply the service pack. Because installing
the service pack forces all clients to generate a complete software inventory
record, this action does not have an adverse effect on the processing that is
performed on the site server.

You can truncate the necessary tables by using the following SQL query:

  TRUNCATE TABLE SoftwareInventoryStatus
  TRUNCATE TABLE SoftwareInventory
  TRUNCATE TABLE SoftwareFile
  TRUNCATE TABLE SoftwareProduct

If you perform this action a long time after you install SP2, it will result in
Software Inventory resynchronization commands being generated at the site server
for each SMS client. The site will recover in time, but it may take some time
before the clients receive the resynchronization commands and then generate
complete inventory records.

If you use this method to correct the problem, it may not be necessary to install
the hotfix because the hotfix will provide only marginal performance increases
if the software inventory tables remain small. However, the more file types (for
example, .dll, .exe, .vxd, files, etc.) that are returned by software inventory,
the larger the tables will become. Installing the hotfix should also speed
performance of custom queries that query the software inventory data.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine if your primary site server is affected by this problem, run the
following SQL queries to examine the nature of the records in the SoftwareFile
table.

The following query shows the total number of records in the SoftwareFile table:

  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM SoftwareFile

Compare the total number of records to the number of records returned by this
query:

  SELECT DISTINCT FileName, FileDescription, FileVersion, FileSize FROM
  SoftwareFile

The second number of records should match the first. If they do not, there are
records in the table that are not needed. For example, if the total number of
records is ten or twenty times the number of records returned by the second
query, the performance of the Software Inventory Processor component is probably
being affected by this this difference.

The additional indexes provided with the hotfix increase the performance of SQL
queries on the SoftwareFile and SoftwareProduct tables. However, they may not
resolve all performance problems in which the numbers of records in the tables
are too large. In this situation, it might be necessary to use the method in the
"Workaround" section to resolve any long-term performance problems that are
caused by an excessive number of records in the SoftwareFile table.

In cases in which the total number of records is not that much larger than the
results returned in the second query, the database maintenance performed by the
SMS SQL Monitor service can eliminate the extra data.

To take advantage of this, enable both the Delete Aged Discovery Data and Delete
Aged Collected Files tasks in the SMS Administrator console. The Software
Inventory data is deleted in the following manner:

- Delete Aged Discovery Data task:
  When this task is performed, the SMS SQL Monitor component removes old systems
  and related inventory from the SoftwareInventory and SoftwareInventoryStatus
  tables.

- Delete Aged Collected Files task:
  When this task is performed, the SMS SQL Monitor component removes
  non-referenced data from the SoftwareFile and SoftwareProduct tables.
  Specifically, records that are not referenced by a record in the
  SoftwareInventory table are deleted.

Because installing SP2 forces all clients to submit complete inventory records,
this should result in a complete refresh of the data in the Software Inventory
tables.
