SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 and 2000 include a component called Outlook Web
Access (OWA) that enables clients to (among other tasks) read e-mail through a
Web browser. Another function that the component can facilitate is changing of
domain passwords. For this to work with Microsoft Internet Information Services
(IIS) 5.0, you must create and configure a virtual directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use the following steps to enable the IISADMPWD directory for password
changes under Outlook Web Access.

NOTE: By default, this directory is installed as a physical folder under Windows
2000 but not as a virtual directory under Internet Information Services 5.0.
This means that for all intents and purposes, the directory doesn't exist as far
as IIS is concerned.

1. From Windows Explorer, verify that the physical directory exists at
  C:\WINNT\System32\Inetsrv\Iisadmpwd. It should contain nine *.htr files.

2. From within the IIS Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in, open the
  default Web site.

3. Right-click the default Web site and point to New on the pop-up menu, and
  then click Virtual Directory.

4. On the second screen of the wizard, give the virtual directory an alias of
  "IISADMPWD" (without the quotation marks). On the third screen, give the
  folder a physical directory location of "C:\WINNT\System32\Inetsrv\Iisadmpwd"
  (without the quotation marks). On the fourth screen, select Read, Run Script,
  and Execute Access privileges. Click finish on the fifth screen of the wizard
  to prompt creation of the folder.

5. At this point, you can change user passwords through Outlook Web Access.
  Passwords must be entered in a DOMAIN\Username format to be changed.
  Additionally, all password complexity and history requirements must be met
  when you change a password or an error will be returned.

NOTE: The IISADMPWD requires a secure sockets layer (SSL) connection to work.
This is designed to avoid changing passwords across a network through HTTP,
which is clear text. After you click the submit button, the protocol is changed
from HTTP to HTTPS. If necessary, follow the steps in Help to obtain a server
certificate for the Web server
(http://localhost/iishelp/iis/htm/core/iiocrsc.htm on a server with IIS
installed). You can also use Microsoft Certificate Services 2.0 (which is
included with Windows 2000) to sign a server certificate that can be used by IIS
to enable an SSL session.
