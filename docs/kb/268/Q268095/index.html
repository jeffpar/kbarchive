-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect to the Systems Management Server 2.0 site via the
Systems Management Server Administrator console, you may receive the following
error message:

  Connection Failed!

CAUSE
=====

If the SMSProvider_Location value in the Repository is changed from TRUE to
FALSE, this causes any Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in that was
created after the change to fail to connect. The MMC interprets the FALSE value
as NO, therefore causing the connection to fail.

NOTE: Microsoft recommends that you avoid making manual changes to the values
listed in ProviderForLocalSite. This article discusses a situation that can
occur if this value is changed. Improperly modifying this value can cause a
disruption of normal Systems Management Server operations.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. On the Start menu, click Run.

2. Type "wbemtest" (without the quotation marks), and then click Connect.

3. In the Server\Namespace field, type "\\servername\root\sms" (without the
  quotation marks) (where servername is the Windows NT name of your Systems
  Management Server Site server).

4. Click Login, click Enum classes, click Recursive, and then click OK.

5. Wait for a result (a list of data) and then scroll to the bottom of the
  result and double-click SMS_ProviderLocation.

6. Click the Instances option.

  This brings up SMS_ProviderLocation.SiteCode=XXX (where XXX represents your
  site code).

7. Double-click ProviderForLocalSite, and change the Value from FALSE to TRUE.

8. Click Save Property, and then click Save Object until WBEMTEST closes.

9. Start the Systems Management Server Administrator console and attempt to
  connect
.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Administrator console is hosted by the Microsoft Management Console (MMC), a
framework for hosting management tools. A console file (that has an extension
.msc) is used to define the contents of the MMC, and can be customized for
particular tasks. The .msc file stores the location of the SMS Provider Server.

SMS Providers are Web-based enterprise management (WBEM) providers that act as
intermediaries between CIMOM and one or more managed objects. When CIMOM
receives a request from a management application for data that is not available
from the CIMOM repository, or for notifications of events that CIMOM does not
support, it forwards the request to a provider. Providers supply data and event
notifications for managed objects that are specific to their particular domain.
