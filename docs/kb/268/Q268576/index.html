SUMMARY
=======

When you export the settings of a Mailbox, you may see the "Hide from AB" field.
This field is used to determine whether or not a Mailbox is visible in the
global address list. By default, when Mailboxes are first created on an Exchange
server, they are not hidden from the address book. The "Hide from AB" field is
empty when you export it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You might expect that, by default, this field would be set to 0 for FALSE.
However, if you have never modified the setting on the Advanced tab of the
Mailbox properties, this field setting is empty.

There are three possible settings for this field:

  1 = TRUE (Mailbox is hidden)
  0 = FALSE (Mailbox is visible)
  NULL = FALSE (Mailbox is visible)

You will only see a value of 0 if the Mailbox has been hidden from the Address
Book in the past, and then unhidden. This has no effect on the performance of
Exchange, but this may be a factor to consider when you create scripts to run
against exported .csv files that contain user settings.
