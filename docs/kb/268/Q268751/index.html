MORE INFORMATION
================

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry.
Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you
understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information
about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following
article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

In this scenario, multiple users need to log on to the same computer and
connection to Terminal Server. Using the Terminal Server Client Connection
Manager, the administrator can create a desktop icon that automatically connects
to a Terminal Server computer.

However, the icon uses the user profile information that is stored in the
registry for the user who creates the icon. To change the configuration in the
registry to use the user profile of a user who logs on to the computer, follow
these steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedit) and locate the following key:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client

2. Export this key to the desktop.

3. Open this key in Notepad, and then edit the key by replacing
  HKEY_CURRENT_USER with HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Import.

4. Save the edited key file, and then quit Registry Editor.

5. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32) and click HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE to highlight
  it.

6. Load the Ntuser.dat file from the \Winnt\Profiles\Default User folder as a
  hive. When prompted, name the new hive Import.

7. Double-click the exported registry file that you had previously edited, to
  load it.

8. Highlight the Import hive under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, and then unload it.

  Note: You have now modified the Default User Ntuser.dat file to include the
  information needed for all new users to gain access to the icon.

9. Copy the icon for the Terminal Server session to the desktop while you are
  logged on as the user who created the session.

10. Copy the icon from the desktop to the Winnt\Profiles\Allusers\Desktop
  folder.

  Note: All new users who log on can now connect to this session. For current
  users to connect to this session, export the key
  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client from the initial
  user who created the session. Current users must double-click the key to
  load it, and then they can gain access to the common Terminal Server
  session.
