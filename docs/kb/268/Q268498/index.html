  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

A "Stop 0x0000001E - KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED" error message may occur when
the SNA Server service starts after you install the Digi Datafire 570 SDLC link
service. The Stop screen information indicates that the Digi570mp.sys driver is
the cause of the problem.

CAUSE
=====

This stop error can occur if the Digi Datafire 570 SDLC Link Service has been
installed by using the External Link Service (Linkset.exe) on the Tools menu in
the SNA Server Manager instead of using the Insert Link Service option.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, you must completely remove the link service and driver
files, and then reinstall them. To do this, perform the following steps:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Remove the Digi Network adapter by double-clicking the Network icon in
  Control Panel, and then selecting Adapters. Restart the computer when you are
  prompted.

2. Remove the External Link Service drivers by selecting the Digi/Sync Link
  Service. To do this, on the SNA Server Tools menu, click External Link
  Services, select Links, and then click Remove.

3. Remove the files associated with the Digi Link Service from the from the
  SNAROOT\System\Hwsetup directory. The files all begin with DIGI.

4. In Registry Editor, remove all of the references to the Digi drivers. These
  drivers are located under the following registry keys and all begin with
  Digi, Dgi, or DGP:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/Microsoft
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/System/CurrentControlSet/Services

5. Reinstall the Digi Surefire adapter through the Control Panel Network icon by
  selecting Adapters, and then clicking Add.

6. Configure SNA Server to be the layer 2 protocol for that adapter. To do this,
  open the properties for the adapter, select the line to configure, and then
  select SNA as the protocol.

7. To install the link service, open the SNA Server Manager, choose Insert,
  select Link Service, select Digi SDLC, and then answer the remaining
  configuration questions as appropriate.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A Stop error message can also occur if the incorrect Digi Link Service for the
adapter has been installed or is misconfigured.
