SUMMARY
=======

This article lists frequently asked questions about using Integrated Services
Digital Network (ISDN) with MSN, the Microsoft Network.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Q. What is ISDN?

  A. Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is a high-speed, fully digital
  telephone service that provides Internet access with data throughput up to
  128 kilobits per second (Kbps). ISDN provides the following benefits:
   - Speed: ISDN transmits information over four times faster than analog
     modems. That means graphics, audio, and video files on the Internet can be
     received much faster, and download time is substantially decreased. If you
     are dialing into a corporate local area network (LAN), ISDN allows
     programs to run at speeds much closer to the speed of the LAN in the
     office.

   - Clear connections: ISDN transmits data digitally and, as a result, is less
     susceptible to noise than analog transmissions. Data connections are
     virtually error-free. Analog modem connections must dedicate some
     bandwidth to error correction and retransmission. This overhead reduces
     the actual throughput, while an ISDN line can dedicate all its bandwidth
     to data transmission.

   - Rapid call setup: In addition to raw speed, ISDN calls can be set up much
     faster than analog phone calls. While an analog modem can take up to a
     minute to set up a connection, you can be transmitting data in about two
     seconds with ISDN. Because ISDN is fully digital, the lengthy handshaking
     process of analog modems is not required.

2. Q. Does ISDN require a special cable?

  A. No. ISDN uses the same cable as your existing telephone system. Most lines
  do not require any special conditioning to provide ISDN service because the
  existing telephone system is digital. Typically, the only analog connection
  is from the telephone company to your home or office.

3. Q. What do I need to use ISDN with MSN?

  A. Unlike analog telephone service, ISDN service is not yet available
  everywhere. Your telephone company must have the necessary equipment
  installed in the central office that serves you. You must also have an ISDN
  adapter.

4. Q. How do you know if your telephone company has the necessary equipment?

  A. Contact your local telephone company to find out if they have ISDN
  equipment, or you may find the information at the following Microsoft Web
  site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/windows/getisdn/default.htm

5. Q. How are ISDN networks configured?

  A. The most common Basic Rate Interface (BRI) ISDN divides the telephone line
  into three digital channels: One delta (D) channel for signaling, and two
  bearer (B) channels for data, each of which can be used simultaneously.

  ISDN may also use a Primary Rate Interface (PRI). These networks use either 24
  (23 B plus one D) or 31 (30 B plus one D) channel interfaces. These types of
  configurations are usually found in corporate PBX, telephone company, or long
  distance carrier offices.

  ISDN uses a terminal adapter, which replaces the modem, to adapt the channels
  to existing equipment. Traditional telecommunications equipment, such as
  telephones and fax machines, can also be attached to the BRI if they have the
  proper hardware and software interfaces.

6. Q. What is the difference between single-channel and dual-channel ISDN?

  A. The following descriptions of single-channel and dual-channel ISDN are
  based on BRI:
   - Single-channel ISDN uses one B channel, which means you can connect at 64
     Kbps or 56 Kbps, depending on your carrier.

   - Dual-channel ISDN combines both B channels of your ISDN line using
     Multilink PPP (MP) to connect to the Internet up to 128 Kbps. If you make
     a dual-channel call, you cannot use your second channel for other
     applications, such as fax or voice calls.

     Currently, all of the MSN ISDN telephone numbers in the United States and
     Canada can receive dual-channel calls. Dual-channel ISDN is not supported
     outside of these two countries. MSN is investigating offering dual-channel
     ISDN services in other international markets.

7. Q. How is BRI set up?

  A. ISDN service connects your home or office to the telephone company through
  a U interface. The U interface, which can be no more than 18,000 feet in
  length, is a two-wire connection that connects the wall jack in your home or
  office to the telephone company central office. At the central office, the U
  interface connects to a Network Termination (NT-1) device. The NT-1 device is
  often built into ISDN hardware. The NT-1 device terminates the U interface
  and converts it to a T interface for use by terminal adapters.

8. Q. What is a SPID?

  A. A Service Profile ID (SPID) is used to identify which services and features
  are supplied to the ISDN connection. SPIDs usually consist of the ten-digit
  phone number, plus a prefix and a suffix to identify additional services. If
  a device is configured without a SPID or with an incorrect SPID, it is unable
  to establish and maintain a network connection, even though the basic
  transport mechanism has been established.

9. Q. How do I obtain ISDN service?

  A. To learn about ISDN, download free ISDN software, and electronically order
  an ISDN line from participating telephone companies in the United States,
  Canada, or other countries, visit the following Microsoft Web page:

  http://www.microsoft.com/windows/getisdn/default.htm

10. Q. How can I sign up for MSN using ISDN?

  A. If you are not an MSN member, you need to use an analog modem to set up
  MSN and to open an MSN account. For information about how to install MSN,
  please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q174200 How to Install The Microsoft Network Version 2.5

  If you are an MSN member, use your MSN account. To connect using ISDN, use
  the following steps:
  1. Click Start, and then click The Microsoft Network.

  2. On the MSN Sign-In screen, click Settings.

  3. Next to the Phone Number box, click Phone Book.

  4. In the Service Type box, click ISDN.

  5. Click the appropriate entries in the Country, State Or Region, and Access
     Numbers boxes, and then click OK.

  6. Repeat steps 3-5, but click Phone Book next to the Backup Number box in
     step 3.

11. Q. What is the MSN plan for ISDN?

  A. MSN is dedicated to providing the highest-quality package for Internet
  users and delivering the best content available on the Internet. Currently,
  MSN offers one of the largest ISDN Internet networks, with 724 local access
  locations worldwide. More than 325 U.S. locations support the point-to-point
  protocol (PPP) and multilink PPP (MP). PPP and MP allow throughput rates up
  to 128 Kbps.

12. Q. How much does ISDN phone service typically cost?

  A. ISDN phone service rates vary with each telephone company. The rate
  usually includes a basic ISDN service, and additional per-minute charges.
  There may also be an initial setup or installation fee. Contact your local
  telephone company to find out what ISDN costs in your area.

13. Q. Which ISDN adapters are supported by MSN?

  A. For information about the ISDN adapters supported by MSN, please see the
  following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q174019 Integrated Service Digital Network Adapters Supported by MSN
