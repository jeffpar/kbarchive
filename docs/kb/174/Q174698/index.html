SYMPTOMS
========

The LinkAge Notes Directory Exchange Agent (DXA) will not process any requests.
It appears to initialize properly and does not do anything. Requests from
LinkAge Administrator's Process Manager to stop the process do not take effect.
The LinkAge Notes DXA is stuck in the current activity "Processing Inbound MIF
Message," regardless of size of the update. After you terminate the process
through Windows NT 4.0 Task Manager (Lsdxants.exe), within the next minute the
log reveals the following (logs are located in LINKAGE\LOGS directory):

  1997/09/22 17:57:34- LDE(01a8) 4 10153:Subtask DXANOTES(lsdxants.exe)
  has ended with return code 1
  &gt;&gt; subtask(441)
  1997/09/22 17:57:34- LDE(01a8) 2 10157:Subtask DXANOTES generated the
  following messages:
  &gt;&gt; subtask(1031)
  1997/09/22 17:57:34- LDE(01a8) 2 10158: DXANOTES&gt; The ID file being used
  is: C:\notes_server\data\user.id
  &gt;&gt; subtask(1049)
  1997/09/22 17:57:34- LDE(01a8) 2 10158: DXANOTES&gt; Enter password (press
  the Esc key to abort):
  &gt;&gt; subtask(1049)

CAUSE
=====

The incorrect Lotus Notes ID file is being used in reference to the LinkAge
Notes Directory Exchange Agent (DXA). The LinkAge Notes DXA, similar to the
LinkAge Notes Connector, requires a Notes ID file with no password.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do the following:

1. Check the [DXANOTES] section in the Linkage.ini file, located in the \LINKAGE
  directory. The parameter NOTESINI points to the location of the Notes.ini
  file that the LinkAge Notes DXA will use.

2. Start a Notes client pointing to the Notes.ini file (notes.exe
  =c:\notes\notes.ini).

3. Select the File menu, and then click Tools, and select User ID to verify
  which ID file is being used by the LinkAge Notes DXA.

4. Change the User ID to the proper Notes ID (should not have a password) by
  going to the File menu, clicking Tools, and selecting Switch ID.

5. If you receive one of the following pop-up messages:

  The ID file is locked by another process. Try again later.

  -or-

  Unable to open desktop file. Notes may have terminated abnormally in an
  earlier session. Please log off or shut down the operating system before
  running Notes again.

  you should stop the LinkAge controller service from Control Panel and ensure
  that no Lsdxants.exe, Lsntsmex.exe, Lsmexnts.exe, Notes.exe, or Nlnotes.exe
  processes are resident in memory. If so, terminate them using task manager
  and attempt another dirsync cycle.

6. If this fails, restart the computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, LinkAge Message Exchange (LME) and the LinkAge Directory Exchange
(LDE) components connect to the same Notes server. Therefore, the Notes.ini
parameter in the LME-NOTES and DXANOTES section points to the same Notes.ini
file on the LinkAge computer. If the LDE component is connecting to a different
Notes server than the LME component, the Notes.ini parameter in the DXANOTES
section of the Linkage.ini file must reflect this difference; otherwise, dirsync
will not work. Check this parameter first, and confirm that it is correct.
