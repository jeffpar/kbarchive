This article contains tips for interpreting security auditing events related to
user authentication.

These events will all appear in the Security event log and will be logged with a
source of Security.

          Account Manager
  528     Successful Logon
  529     Logon Failure: Unknown user name or bad password

  Q174074 Security Event Descriptions

Security Identifiers (SIDs)
---------------------------

Some security events report SIDs instead of user names. In this case, it is often
difficult to determine which user account is being referred to in the event.

It is possible to build a list of mappings of user names to SIDs by performing
the following steps:

1. Dump the user list to a text file with the NET USERS command or with
  Addusers.exe.

2. Modify this text file to remove unwanted information (headers, and so forth).

3. Modify the resulting list of user names into a batch file, using the GETSID
  resource kit utility to translate each user name into a SID. Redirect the
  output to a text file.

4. When you encounter a SID, search the text file (created previously) for that
  SID. This will place you on the line with the user's name.

Logon Type
----------

"Logon Type" will be one of the following:

  2  Interactive
  3  Network
  4  Batch
  5  Service
  6  Proxy
  7  Unlock Workstation
  (0 &amp; 1 are invalid)

Logon Process
-------------

"Logon Process" will be one of the following:

 "msv1_0" or "MICROSOFT_AUTHENTICATION_PACKAGE_V1_0":
    msv1_0.dll, the default authentication package

 "KSecDD":
    ksecdd.sys, the security device driver

 "User32" or "WinLogon\MSGina":
    winlogon.exe &amp; msgina.dll, the authentication user interface

 "SCMgr":
    The Service Control Manager

 "LAN Manager Workstation Service"

 "advapi"
  API call to LogonUser

 "MS.RADIU":
   The RADIUS authentication package; a part of the Microsoft Internet
   Authentication Services (IAS).
