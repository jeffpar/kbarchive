SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer includes a feature that allows you
to back up files that are replaced during an installation. This process is not
automatic by default.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To enable support for backing up replaced files, the Installer variable
BACKUPDIR must be set to a value that is a valid directory path. Typically a
backup directory would be created below a program's main installation
directory.

Use either of the two following methods to ensure that the BACKUPDIR variable is
set.

METHOD 1

If you wish to display the Backup Replaced Files dialog box or are performing a
silent installation (using the /s command line switch), do the following:

1. Under Installation Interface, click the Dialogs tab.

2. Click to select the Backup Replaced Files check-box.

  This will display the dialog asking whether you want to back up replaced
  files, and what directory to store them in, and then sets the BACKUPDIR
  appropriately. If the option to display the dialog is selected, the default
  is set to %MAINDIR%\BACKUP.

NOTE: When a Systems Management Server Installer executable is run with the /s
switch (for silent installation), none of the dialogs selected are displayed,
but if the Backup Replaced Files dialog box is selected, BACKUPDIR will still be
set to %MAINDIR%\BACKUP, and files will be backed up accordingly.

METHOD 2

If you wish to have an interactive installation, but prefer not to include the
Backup Replaced Files dialog box, in Script Editor view, insert a Set Variable
script item before the first instance of any Install File script items:

  Variable: BACKUPDIR
  New Value: %MAINDIR%\BACKUP
  Operation: Nothing

Either of these methods will cause a backup directory to be created (user
specified location for Method 1 and BACKUP under the application's main
directory for the Method 2). As each file is installed, Installer will check to
see if the file being installed is replacing a current file. If it is, it will
backup the current file to the specified backup directory, then install the new
file. If the application is later uninstalled, the backed-up files will be
restored.

For more information on creating backup copies of replaced files, refer to the
online help provided with Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer. Search
the index for the word "BACKUPDIR" (without the quotation marks).
