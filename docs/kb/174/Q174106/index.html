-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- The Microsoft Network version 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The first time you connect to MSN, The Microsoft Network, version 2.5, you are
prompted to use Microsoft Internet Mail. If you click the Use Internet Mail
link, your MSN e-mail address is changed from &lt;Member_ID&gt;@msn.com to
&lt;Member_ID&gt;@email.msn.com.

NOTE: Your MSN e-mail address is also changed when you install the version of MSN
provided with Windows 98.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MSN 2.5 enables you to use an Internet-based e-mail client (for example,
Microsoft Outlook Express) that uses Post Office Protocol (POP3) and Simple Mail
Transport Protocol (SMTP) e-mail servers. POP3 and SMTP e-mail servers are both
faster and more reliable, and support Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
(MIME) encoded file attachments, so it is easier for you to send and receive
documents over the Internet.

This does not affect the use of your MSN account. Your MSN e-mail address remains
&lt;Member_ID&gt;@msn.com. However, if you use &lt;Member_ID&gt;@email.msn.com
as your MSN e-mail address, your e-mail messages travel more quickly over the
Internet and are often received in less time.

Effects on Internet Services
----------------------------

If you subscribe to Internet services such as mailing lists or majordomo, you can
still receive e-mail from these services, but you may be unable to send e-mail
to the service.

If you are no longer able to send e-mail to an Internet service, cancel your
subscription to the service and then resubscribe using your new MSN e-mail
address. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you.

NOTE: If you only receive e-mail from Internet services, this change does not
affect you.
