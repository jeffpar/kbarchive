-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP3 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Computers running Windows NT version 4.0 with Service Pack 3 installed may
display the following pop-up dialog box from certain applications after the
applications have been running for some time:

  DLL Initialization Failed
  Initialization of the dynamic link library crypt32.dll failed.
  The process is terminating abnormally.

CAUSE
=====

This problem will occur if an application stays resident, such as a service, and
repeatedly loads and unloads Crypt32.dll, Security.dll, or Schannel.dll.

RESOLUTION
==========

Apply the updated version of Crypt32.dll to correct the problem. If the problem
occurs as soon as an application is started or after the update has been
applied, verify that all DLLs required by the application are in the system
path.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0, Service
Pack 3. A supported fix is now available, but is not fully regression tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
