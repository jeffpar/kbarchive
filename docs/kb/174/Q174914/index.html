The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Encarta 98 Encyclopedia for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Encarta 98 Encyclopedia, you may experience one or more of the
following symptoms:

- When you start Encarta 98, it may open directly to the Articles screen
  instead of the Home screen.
- When you start Encarta 98, it may stop responding (hang).
- If you click the Home button on the Articles screen, Encarta 98 may stop
  responding (hang).
- When you attempt to play an InterActivity or Collage in Encarta 98, nothing
  may happen.
- When you play an animation, Encarta 98 may stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if Macromedia Director or Macromedia ShockWave Flash is
not installed correctly. Encarta 98 uses Macromedia Director and Macromedia
ShockWave Flash to display animations and InterActivities.

==========
