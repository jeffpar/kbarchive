SUMMARY
=======

The following are typical user profile scenarios that you may encounter. Each of
these scenarios includes a brief description of the situation, the current
status of the profiles on the server, actions that you need to take to
administer the profile properly, any required user action, references to
sections of this guide that have more detailed information, and any applicable
usage notes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Existing Windows NT 3.5x Roaming Profile
----------------------------------------

A domain user has an existing Windows NT 3.5x roaming profile and will continue
to log on to computers running Windows NT 3.5x only.

What currently exists: A Myuser.usr file exists in the folder
\\MyServer\MyShare.

Administrator action: None.

User action: None.

Existing Windows NT 3.5x Roaming Profile
----------------------------------------

A domain user has an existing Windows NT 3.5x mandatory profile and will continue
to log on to computers running Windows NT 3.5x only.

What currently exists: A Myuser.man file exists in the folder
\\MyServer\MyShare.

Administrator action: None.

User action: None.

Migrating a Windows NT 3.5x Roaming Profile
to a Windows NT 4.0 Roaming Profile
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A domain user has an existing Windows NT 3.5x roaming profile and moves to a
computer running Windows NT 4.0.

What currently exists: A Myuser.usr file exists in the folder
\\MyServer\MyShare.

Administrator action: None.

User action: To automatically upgrade the profile, log on to the computer running
Windows NT 4.0 and then log off. The automatic upgrade creates a new folder with
the name Myuser.pds in the existing directory \\MyServer\MyShare. Inside the new
folder is the upgraded user profile for the domain user.

For more information, see the section "Upgrading 3.5x Server-Based Profiles to
4.0 Roaming Profiles" in the documentation mentioned in the REFERENCE section of
this article.

Migrating a Windows NT 3.5x Mandatory Profile
to a Windows NT 4.0 Mandatory Profile
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A domain user has an existing Windows NT 3.5x mandatory profile and moves to a
computer running Windows NT 4.0 where the user will have a mandatory profile.

What currently exists: A Myuser.man file exists in the folder
\\MyServer\MyShare.

Administrator action: Create a folder with the name Myuser.pdm in the existing
folder \\MyServer\MyShare, and then place the desired mandatory profile into the
new folder.

User action: None.

NOTE: After this procedure is performed, the Windows NT 3.5x profile is still
available to the user should he or she ever log on to a computer running Windows
NT 3.5x again. The Windows NT 4.0 user profile is maintained separately. The
administrator can remove the Windows NT 3.5x profile if the user will only be
using computers running Windows NT 4.0.

For more information, see the section "Upgrading 3.5x Mandatory Profiles to 4.0
Mandatory Profiles" in the documentation mentioned in the REFERENCE section of
this article.

Migrating a Windows NT 3.5x Mandatory Profile
to a Windows NT 4.0 Roaming Profile
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A domain user has an existing Windows NT 3.5x mandatory profile and moves to a
computer running Windows NT 4.0 where they will have a roaming profile.

What currently exists: A Myuser.man file exists in the folder
\\MyServer\MyShare.

Administrator action: Change the user's profile path to
\\MyServer\MyShare\Myuser, and then allow the user to log on and log off the
computer.

User action: When instructed to do so, log on to the computer running Windows NT
4.0 and then log off. This creates the folder \\MyServer\MyShare\Myuser on the
server containing the user's new roaming profile.

For more information, see the section "Creating a New Roaming User Profile for
Windows NT 4.0" in the documentation mentioned in the REFERNCE section of this
article.

Creating a New Windows NT 4.0 Roaming Profile
---------------------------------------------

A new user will be logging on to a computer running Windows NT 4.0 only, and will
be using a roaming profile.

What currently exists: Nothing currently exists for the user in
\\MyServer\MyShare.

Administrator action: In User Manager, specify the user profile path without an
extension. For example, use \\MyServer\MyShare\Myuser.

User action: Log on and then log off the computer. This creates the folder on the
server \\MyServer\MyShare\Myuser that contains the user's new roaming profile.

For more information, see the section "Creating a New Roaming User Profile for
Windows NT 4.0" in the documentation mentioned in the REFERENCE section of this
article.

Creating a New Windows NT 4.0 Mandatory Profile
-----------------------------------------------

A new user will be logging on to a computer running Windows NT 4.0 only, and will
be using a mandatory profile.

What currently exists: Nothing currently exists for the user in
\\MyServer\MyShare.

Administrator action: In User Manager, specify the user profile path with the
extension .man. For example, use \\MyServer\MyShare\Myuser.man. Then, manually
create the Myuser.man folder manually in the \\MyServer\MyShare directory. Place
the mandatory profile for the user in this new folder.

User action: None.

For more information, see the section "Creating a New Mandatory User Profile for
Windows NT 4.0" in the documentation mentioned in the REFERENCE section of this
article.

Updating and Changing a Roaming Profile to a Mandatory Profile
--------------------------------------------------------------

A domain user has an existing Windows NT 4.0 roaming user profile that was not
upgraded from Windows NT 3.5x, and the administrator is going to mandate that
the profile be read or the log on attempt will be denied.

What currently exists: A Myuser folder containing the user's roaming profile
exists in \\MyServer\MyShare.

Administrator action: Use User Manager to add the .man extension to the user
profile path, thus changing the path to \\MyServer\MyShare\Myuser.man. Then,
rename the existing folder that contains the user's roaming profile from Myuser
to Myuser.man. Finally, rename the NTuser.dat file, which is located in the root
of the user's profile folder, to NTuser.man.

User action: None.

For more information, see the section "Making a Roaming Profile Mandatory in
Windows NT 4.0" in the documentation mentioned in the REFERENCE section of this
article.

Changing a Roaming Profile to a Mandatory Profile
-------------------------------------------------

A domain user has an existing Windows NT 4.0 roaming User Profile that was
upgraded from Windows NT 3.5x, and the administrator is going to mandate that
the profile be read or the log on attempt will be denied.

What currently exists: A Myuser.pds folder containing the user's roaming profile
exists in \\MyServer\MyShare.

Administrator action: Use User Manager to change the extension of the user
profile path to .man, changing the path to \\MyServer\MyShare\myuser.man. Then,
rename the existing folder that contains the user's roaming profile from
Myuser.pds to Myuser.pdm. Finally, rename the NTuser.dat file, which is located
in the root of the user's profile folder, to NTuser.man.

User action: None.

For more information, see the section "Making a Roaming Profile Mandatory in
Windows NT 4.0" in the documentation mentioned in the REFERENCE section of this
article.
