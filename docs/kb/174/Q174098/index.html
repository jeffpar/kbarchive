SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to stop receiving promotions sponsored by MSN, The
Microsoft Network, through e-mail.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you join MSN, you can indicate whether you want to receive e-mail about new
products, services, and discounts available only to MSN members from Microsoft
and other featured companies. If you indicated that you would like to receive
this type of e-mail when you joined MSN, you can remove your name from the
mailing list by following these steps:

1. Connect to MSN, and then access the following Web site:

  http://memberservices.msn.com/feedback/optout.asp.

2. On the Communication Preferences Web page, click the "I do not wish to
  receive any unsolicited mail" check box to select it.

3. Click Submit.

These instructions apply only to e-mail sent by MSN. Just as the Postal Service
cannot control every message sent through surface mail, MSN does not have
control over e-mail sent through the Internet from outside of MSN. MSN does not
provide your e-mail address to people who send "junk" e-mail. Instead, e-mail
addresses can be collected from a variety of sources, including chat rooms,
bulletin boards, and newsgroups. If you receive unsolicited e-mail, reply to the
senders and ask them to remove your name from their mailing list. In addition,
there are a number of Web pages that focus on the reduction of "junk" e-mail on
the Internet. Use one of the Internet search engines to locate these Web pages.

Sending unsolicited, commercially-oriented e-mail messages to MSN members is a
violation of the MSN Membership Agreement. If you receive this kind of e-mail
from an MSN member, please notify MSN Member Services.

To report unsolicited or commercially-oriented e-mail messages to MSN Member
Services, use the appropriate steps for your version of MSN:

MSN 2.0
-------

1. Click the question mark in the upper-right corner of MSN Program Viewer, and
  then click Member Services Home Page.

2. Click Help &amp; Support.

3. Click E-mail Member Support.

4. Click "Report a Problem with Another Member," click Next, and then follow the
  instructions on your screen to report a problem.

MSN 2.5
-------

1. Click the MSN Quick View icon on the taskbar, point to Member Services, and
  then click Member Services Home Page.

  -or-

  Click Member Services on the MSN On Stage page.

2. Click Help &amp; Support.

3. Click E-mail Member Support.

4. Click "Report a Problem with Another Member," click Next, and then follow the
  instructions on the screen to report the problem.
