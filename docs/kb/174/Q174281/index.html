- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows 95

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key" Help
topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

Your computer running Windows NT displays a blank desktop or user interface.

CAUSE
=====

A blank desktop or user interface on a computer running Windows NT is caused by
one of two "Zero Administration Kit for Windows 95" executable files. These
executable files are Runshell.exe and Rsreset.exe. These executable files are
found in the setup files and are installed under the ZAK95\Setup\Win95 directory
as a part of the server-base installation point.

Both of the above executable files will rewrite the registry on a computer
running Windows NT Server or Workstation. The registry change occurs on the
computer from which the executable is run (or double-clicked). It changes the
default shell to Runshell.exe that executes a blank desktop (user interface).

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To resolve this problem, edit the registry by performing the following steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), and go to the following subkey:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT
  \CurrentVersion\Winlogon

  NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

2. Edit the Shell string. Replace the string value of Runshell.exe with the
  correct shell executable file listed below:

  Windows NT 4.0 shell executable: EXPLORER.EXE
  Windows NT 3.51 shell executable: PROGMAN.EXE

3. Quit Registry Editor and restart your computer.
