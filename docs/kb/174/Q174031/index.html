The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry. Before
you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if a problem
occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring the Registry"
Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key" Help topic in
Regedt32.exe.

When you attempt to uninstall the Active Server Components from Microsoft
Exchange Server Setup, the check box is dimmed or unavailable. Or you may
receive the following error message:

  Could not remove the file named: c:\exchsrvr\bin\AMHTML.DLL. It is in use by
  another application.

CAUSE
=====

The errors occur because the Active Server components have been improperly
uninstalled, or the Webdata directory or some of its components have been
deleted.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows NT. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To resolve this issue, use the following steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) and locate the following subkey:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Exchange\Setup

2. Select Web Connector, click Delete on the Edit menu, and then click Yes in
  the Confirm Value Delete dialog box.

3. Exit Registry Editor.

4. Start Exchange setup and remove the Active Server Components from the
  Add/Remove dialog.
