The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Client for Windows 95, version 5.0

- Microsoft Outlook 98 
- Microsoft Outlook 97, versions 8.0, 8.01, 8.02, 8.03

SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses how to obtain, install and use the CleanSweep tool. This
tool enables you to delete permissions, forms, views, rules, or reply rule
templates from a Microsoft Exchange Server mailbox. When you delete the rules
and permissions associated with a folder, all rules and permissions for the
folder are deleted. This utility is useful for cases where it has been
determined that Out of Office (OOF) messages or other rules are not functioning
properly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The CleanSweep tool may be obtained from the Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit,
Part Two compact disk.

NOTE: The CleanSweep tool does not work with the Microsoft Exchange Windows 95
client, version 4.0. It is recommended that you use this extension with the
following clients:

  Microsoft Exchange Windows 95 client, version 5.0
  Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0 and 5.0
  Microsoft Outlook Windows 95 client, versions 8.00, 8.01, 8.02, and 8.03
  Microsoft Outlook Windows NT client, versions 8.00, 8.01, 8.02, and 8.03

IMPORTANT: In Outlook 98 and 2000, CleanSweep is unable to properly remove the
following folder attributes:

- Permissions

- Rule Reply Templates (The OOF rule is deleted, but the OOF rule is still set
  to show the user OOF)

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post more information in this
article when the information becomes available.

How to Install the CleanSweep Tool
----------------------------------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To install the extension, complete the following steps:

1. From the following subdirectory of the Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit,
  Part Two CD-ROM

  Exchange\operating system\platform\Admin\Cleanswp

  Copy the Clnswp32.dll file to your system directory, which is \System32 on
  Windows NT.

2. Using Registry Editor (RegEdit.exe for Windows 95, or RegEdt32.exe for
  Windows NT), add the CLNSWP value to the following Registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Exchange\Client\Extensions

3. Enter the following text as a String (REG_SZ) value:

  4.0;drive:\path\CLNSWP32.DLL;2

  where drive and path indicate the location in which you copied the file.

  For example, if the file were located in the C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32 directory, you
  would enter the following text:

  4.0;C:\WINNT\SYSTEM32\CLNSWP32.DLL;2

4. Quit Registry Editor.

5. Restart the Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft Outlook client.

NOTE: You must verify that the Ctl3d32.dll file exists in the System, or System32
directory. The Ctl3d32.dll file depends upon this file, and it may not be
installed by default.

If Ctl3d32.dll does not exist, extract it from the original media from which you
installed the Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft Outlook client.

For Microsoft Exchange 4.0, follow these steps to extract the file:

1. From a Command prompt, navigate to the appropriate directory on the original
  installation media. If you are using Windows 95, go to the \ENG\WIN95
  directory. If you are using Window NT or Windows 2000, go to the
  \ENG\WINNT\I386 directory.

2. Type the following extract command to extract the file:

  extract /a exchng4.cab ctl3d32.dll /L C:\Windows\System

  -or-

  extract /a exchng4.cab ctl3d32.dll /L C:\Winnt\System32

For Microsoft Outlook 97, you can find the Ctl3d32.dll file in the \platform\OS
directory on the CD-ROM.

How to Use the CleanSweep Tool
------------------------------

When the CleanSweep tool is installed, the Clean Sweep option is added to the
Tools menu of the Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft Outlook client. To use the
CleanSweep extension, follow these steps:

1. You may want to save any existing rules prior to running the Clean Sweep tool
  (although this is not necessary).

For additional information about how to save existing rules, click the article
number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152852 XADM: Steps to Move User and Inbox Assistant Rules

2. Click to select the folder (such as Inbox) that contains the items you want
  to delete.

  NOTE: If you do not select a folder, the Clean Sweep menu item will be
  disabled (grayed out).

3. From the Tools menu, click Clean Sweep.

4. Select the items to delete. Click OK.

Sample Scenarios
----------------

The following are two scenarios in which you might need to run the CleanSweep
tool.

NOTE: These steps will remove the multiple OOF replies, but will not delete the
Inbox Assistant rules, so you may want to back up your Out Of Office message
text before you run CleanSweep.

Scenario A:

The Out of Office Assistant responds with two OOF messages instead of one
message. To correct this behavior, follow these steps:

1. Click the Inbox folder.

2. Click Clean Sweep from the Tools menu.

3. Click Rule Reply Templates.

4. Click Details and select all boxes that contain the following text:

  no subject

5. Click OK, and then click OK again..

6. In the OOF Assistant, delete and recreate the OOF rule.

Scenario B:

The Out of Office Assistant responds to incoming mail even when it has been
disabled. To correct this behavior:

1. Start the CleanSweep tool.

2. Click Rules and then click Rule Reply Templates.

3. Click Details and then click to select only the boxes titled.

4. Click OK twice.

5. In the OOF Assistant, delete and recreate the OOF rule.

  NOTE: This will correct the OOF if it is corrupt and not firing, or if it is
  firing even when disabled. However, as a side effect you will lose all Inbox
  Assistant rules as well.
