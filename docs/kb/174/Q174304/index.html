The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a Document Management System (DMS) with Microsoft Word 97, after
you click Save As on the File menu and save a Word document with a different
file name, one of the following symptoms may occur:

Case 1: When You Open a Document
--------------------------------

When you attempt to open a document, you may receive the following error
message:

  File name.doc is being used by another user.

  Do you want to make a copy?

NOTE: File name.doc is the name of the file you are trying to open. This error
message will be displayed if, before you attempt to open the file, another user
opened File name.doc and used the Save As command to save a copy of it. The
error message is displayed even if the other user no longer has File name.doc
open.

You may experience data loss in the original document.


Case 2: If You Are Using GroupWise
----------------------------------

When you click Exit on the File menu with a GroupWise document open, you may
receive the following error message in Word:

  GroupWise error 8201 - cannot return document to library


CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Microsoft Word may not correctly close the original
document when you use the Save As command to save the document with another file
name.

During the "Save As" process, Word looks for a drawing object in the document. If
the document lacks a drawing object, the document is not closed correctly.


NOTE: After you quit Microsoft Word or close the newly created document (the
document you created using the Save As command with File name.doc), the original
document is closed correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, obtain Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, Service Release 2
(SR-2). For additional information about Service Release 2, click the article
number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q151261 OFF97: How to Obtain and Install MS Office 97 SR-2

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.&lt;A0&gt;This problem was corrected in Microsoft
Office 97 for Windows, Service Release 2 (SR-2).

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you previously installed a macro to work around the problem, or if you
installed the Saveas.dot template provided by Microsoft Technical Support, you
may want to remove the macros.

NOTE: If your version of Word was installed with the "Run From Network Server"
option, contact your network administrator to complete these steps.

To remove the macros, follow these steps:

1. Open the Normal.dot file. By default, the Normal.dot file is located in the
  following folder:

Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft Windows 98:

  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Templates

Microsoft Windows 95 and Microsoft Windows 98 with Profiles Enabled, or Microsoft
Windows NT 4.0:

  C:\WindowsFolder\Profiles\UserName\Application Data\Microsoft\Templates

Microsoft Windows 2000:

  C:\Documents and Settings\UserName\Application Data\Microsoft\Templates

2. On the Tools menu, point to Macro, and then click Macros.

3. Select the Document_open macro, and then click Delete.

4. Close Word. If prompted, save the changes to Normal.dot. If you are unable to
  save the changes to Normal.dot, contact your network administrator.
