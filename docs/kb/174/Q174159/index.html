SUMMARY
=======

The Visual Basic 5.0 Setup Wizard Help contains some incorrect information
regarding code signing with Authenticode. This article contains the correct
information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Visual Basic 5.0 Setup Wizard Help, under "Setup Wizard -- Internet
Package," states:

  "Although Visual Basic, version 5.0, does not include any tools to digitally
  sign components, the Setup Wizard-generated .cab files reserve space for you
  to add a digital signature at a later time. To get your files digitally
  signed you can:

- Send them to a service provider such as VeriSign, who keeps the private key.
  The service provider signs the files and returns them to you.

- Purchase special hardware and/or software which stores your private key
  locally. When you are ready to sign your files, run a utility such as
  CodeSign to sign your files. The ActiveX SDK includes tools to create text
  signatures.

- Use the ActiveX SDK to create test digital signatures."

The above statements should be replaced with the following corrected and updated
information:

  Although Visual Basic, version 5.0, does not include any tools to digitally
  sign components, the Setup Wizard-generated .cab files reserve space for you
  to add a digital signature at a later time.

  You can sign your files by creating a "test certificate" with signing tools
  provided in the ActiveX SDK (for Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.02) or
  Internet Client SDK (for Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 and above). In
  addition to the code signing tools you will need either:

- A digital code signing certificate obtained from a Certificate Authority such
  as VeriSign,

  -or-

- A test code signing certificate created using the code signing tools
  mentioned above.

Note that the test code signing certificate is for test purposes only and not for
final code distribution.
