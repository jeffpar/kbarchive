SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to find a contact or group by clicking Start, pointing to Find,
and then clicking People, you may receive the following error message when you
click a directory service in the Search box:

  WAB caused a general protection fault in module USER.EXE

CAUSE
=====

This error message can occur if the entry for the directory service is damaged.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, remove and re-create the directory service entry. To do
this, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click People.

2. Right-click Windows Address Book, and then click Directory Services.

3. Click the appropriate directory service, and then click Remove.

4. Click Add to re-create the entry, and then click the General tab.

5. In the Friendly Name box, type the name you want to appear for the directory
  service in the list of directory services. For example, for The Microsoft
  Network, you may want to type "MSN" (without quotation marks).

6. In the Directory Service box, type the name of the Internet directory server.
  For example, for MSN, The Microsoft Network, type the following:

  "ldap.msn.com" (without the quotation marks)

7. Under Authentication Type, click the appropriate option for your directory
  service. The following authentication types are available:
   - Anonymous: This setting specifies to use anonymous authentication with
     this directory service, which requires no user name or password.

   - Secure Password (Requires Server Support): This setting specifies that
     this server requires you to use challenge/response password authentication
     to log on, such as Microsoft Distributed Password Authentication (DPA).
     For additional information about this setting, right-click the Secure
     Password (Requires Server Support) option, and then click What's This? on
     the menu that appears.

   - Password: This setting specifies to use user name and password
     authentication for this directory service.

     If you are creating an entry for MSN, click Secure Password (Requires
     Server Support).

8. Click the "Check names against this server when sending mail" check box to
  select it or clear it as appropriate for your directory service. This setting
  specifies that when you send mail, recipient names are checked against this
  directory service to verify that the e-mail addresses are correct. For MSN,
  this check box should be clear.

9. Click OK, and then click OK again to close the Directory Services dialog box.
