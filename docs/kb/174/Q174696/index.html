SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to send files to Microsoft Product Support Services if
a Microsoft Support Professional requests that you do so.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To send files to Microsoft Product Support Services::

NOTE: This method of sending files to Product Support Services is standard across
products. However, the directory location for files is different for each
product.

1. At a command prompt, FTP to ftppss.microsoft.com.

2. Log on as ANONYMOUS, and use your e-mail address as the password. For
  example, if your e-mail address is JoeSmith@microsoft.com, use that as your
  password.

3. You are now logged on to the Microsoft FTP server.

4. To change the directory, type the following command:

  cd /incoming/mail

NOTE: Depending on which group you are working with, the above "mail" directory
can be replaced by any of the following:

  /com+
  /developer
  /gls
  /hiserver
  /iis
  /mail
  /misc
  /mom
  /msmq
  /premier
  /sms
  /sql
  /webresponse
  /windows
  /windowsce
  /xbox

Also note that this list is subject to change.
5. You are now in the correct directory to upload the file.

6. The command to upload a file may vary based on the utility that you use.
  Typically the command is similar to the following:

  put &lt;file name&gt;

  Before you perform the command, make sure that you are in binary mode. For
  more information on how to set the FTP transfer mode to binary, see the
  following example of a customer FTP session:

  

  C:\&gt;ftp ftppss.microsoft.com.

  Connected to ftppss.microsoft.com.

  220 tkmsftftpf01 Microsoft FTP Service (Version 5.0).

  User (ftppss.microsoft.com:(none)): anonymous

  331 Anonymous access allowed, send identity (e-mail name) as password.

  Password:

  230-This is FTPPSS.MICROSOFT.COM.

  230 Anonymous user logged in.

  ftp&gt; cd /incoming/mail 

  250 CWD command successful.

  ftp&gt; binary

  200 Type set to I. 

  ftp&gt; put mailfile.zip 

  200 PORT command successful. 

  150 Opening ASCII mode data connection for mailfile.zip. 

  226 Transfer complete. 

  3800 bytes sent in 1.01 seconds (3.80 Kbytes/sec) 

  ftp&gt; bye 

  221  Thank-you for using Microsoft products!

NOTE: Unless a Microsoft Support Professional advises you to follow a different
procedure, place the files in a zipped format, and use the case number as the
file name (for example, SRX970228699123.zip).

The following are the various directories available under /incoming/:

  /com+
  /developer
  /gls
  /hiserver
  /iis
  /mail
  /misc
  /mom
  /msmq
  /premier
  /sms
  /sql
  /webresponse
  /windows
  /windowsce
  /xbox

For example, if files need to be sent to support professionals on a Windows NT
issue, the directory for Step 4 would be:

  /incoming/windows
