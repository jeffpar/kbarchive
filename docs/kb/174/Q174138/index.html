  organized by topic. MSN bulletin boards are newsgroups that hold MSN content.
  These bulletin boards are stored on the MSNNews server.

  Communicate Home Page has links to bulletin boards.

3. Q. Who can exclude me from a forum chat or bulletin board?

  A. Exclusion from forum chats and bulletin boards is at the discretion of the
  individual forum manager.

Forums
------

1. Q. What are forums?

  A. Forums are public meeting areas where MSN members can discuss ideas, gather
  information, or find out what other people have to say. Each MSN forum is
  centered around a specific subject, theme, or hobby. There are about 80
  special-interest forums on MSN.

2. Q. How do I find a forum on MSN?

  A. To find a forum, click MSN Forums on the Communicate home page, and then
  click the forum you want to view.

  manager of the forum that you want to assist or host. If you would like to
  become a forum manager, e-mail your resume and proposal to: Content_Provider.
  Include a list of your interests and hobbies.

Newsgroups
----------

1. Q. What is a newsgroup?

  A. A newsgroup is a public bulletin board where Internet users can post, read,
  and reply to messages that anyone can see. An Internet newsgroup can contain
  hundreds or thousands of articles posted each day from all over the world.
  These newsgroups originate outside of MSN, and we have no control over the
  names of the newsgroups or the content of any newsgroup messages. MSN carries
  newsgroups as part of the service to members, but we do not monitor or claim
  any responsibility for what is contained in these groups.

2. Q. How do I subscribe to a newsgroup?

  A. To subscribe to a newsgroup, follow these steps:
  1. In the Newsgroups box, click the Newsgroups icon.

  2. If a News Servers list is displayed, click one of the servers to select
     it.

  3. Scroll down the newsgroup list. Click one of the newsgroups to select it.

  4. Click Subscribe.

3. Q. How do I cancel my subscription to a newsgroup?

  A. To cancel a subscription, on the News menu, click Unsubscribe from this
  Newsgroup.

4. Q. How do I view Internet newsgroups?

  A. Throughout MSN, there are links to bulletin boards and newsgroups. Click
  the Communicate page for access to many of them.

  To access newsgroups, follow these steps:
  1. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click Internet News.

  2. Click Newsgroups.

5. Q. Why are newsgroup messages no longer posted when I return to a newsgroup?

  A. Actually, those messages are usually still there. The default in Internet
  News is set to eliminate messages that you have already read. To change this
  or to check for messages that you have read before, click All Messages on the
  View menu. In a minute or two the messages reappear.

6. Q. Is there an extra charge for subscribing to a newsgroup?

  A. There is no extra charge for subscribing to a newsgroup. The term
  "subscribe" means that your newsgroup reader will keep track of the messages
  you have read and downloaded from visit to visit. You can subscribe and
  unsubscribe at any time with no additional charge.

7. Q. Why am I unable to find an Internet newsgroup that I believe should be
  there?

  A. MSN tries to keep its feed as current as possible, but occasionally we do
  miss a new group or fall behind. If you send an e-mail message to
  newsmaster@msn.com, we may be able to get the group up more quickly.

8. Q. How do I read newsgroup messages offline?

  A. Once you download the newsgroup message you want to read, you can
  disconnect from your Internet service provider (ISP) and read the message
  offline. To download messages in a newsgroup, follow these steps:
  1. In the message list, click the message you want to download. To select
     more than one message for downloading, hold down the CTRL key while
     clicking each message.

  2. On the Off-line menu, click Mark Message For Download.

  3. On the Off-line menu, click Post And Download.

  4. Click File, and then click Disconnect.

9. Q. Why am I unable to access a newsgroup that appears in the newsgroup list?

  A. You may not be able to access the newsgroup because it has been removed
  from the server. You can determine this by resetting the newsgroup list. If
  the title of the newsgroup no longer appears in the list, it has been
  removed.

  To reset the newsgroup list, use the following steps:
  1. Click Internet Community (Culture/Newsgroups) located on the Communicate
     page in MSN.

  2. Click Internet News Groups.

  3. Double-click Try Newsgroups Now!

  4. Click Newsgroups.

  5. In the News Servers box, click the Newsgroup icon of the newsgroup you
     usually access.

  6. Click Reset List.

  7. Look in the list of Newsgroups to see if your newsgroup is still listed.
     If not, the newsgroup has been removed from the server. If it is still
     listed, try to access it again.

Internet News
-------------

1. Q. What is Internet News?

  A. Internet News is a program you can use to view both MSN bulletin boards and
  Internet newsgroups. Within this program, both Internet newsgroups and MSN
  bulletin boards are referred to as newsgroups.

2. Q. How do I uninstall Internet Mail and News?

  A. To uninstall Internet News and Mail, follow these steps:
  1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

  2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

  3. Click the Install/Uninstall tab.

  4. In the list of installed programs, click Internet Mail And News.

  5. Click Add/Remove.

3. Q. What are the paper clips in the newsgroup messages, and how do I open
  attachments?

  A. Paper clips are symbols for file attachments. To view an attachment, click
  the paper clip icon. It displays the file type as well as the size. To open
  the attachment, click the file, move the mouse pointer onto the file, and
  open it when you are prompted.

4. Q. How do I clean up the news files stored on my computer?

  A. Internet News stores information about newsgroups and messages in files
  kept locally on your computer. This reduces the amount of traffic (and
  connection time) necessary to browse through newsgroups and messages. To
  clear out these files, use the following steps:
  1. On the File menu of the Newsgroups box, click Clean Up Files, and then
     click Delete.

  2. When you are prompted if you are sure you want to delete all your
     newsgroup files, click Yes.

  3. Click Close.

5. Q. What is a thread?

  A. A thread is an original message and any posted replies. Threads are sorted
  and grouped according to the original title. For example, a thread that
  starts with a message titled "Please do not post binaries in this newsgroup"
  includes all of the replies titled "RE: Please do not post binaries in this
  newsgroup."

  If you reply to a message and change the title, you start a new thread. For
  example, posting a reply titled "Let's end this thread: Please do not post
  binaries in this newsgroup" starts a new thread.

6. Q. How do I view messages by thread?

  A. To view messages by thread, follow these steps:
  1. On the View menu, point to Sort By.

  2. Click Group Messages By Thread.

     You can also expand or collapse individual threads by clicking the plus (+)
     or minus (-) sign next to the original message, or by clicking the message
     and then clicking Expand or Collapse on the View menu.

7. Q. What is SPAM? How do I avoid becoming a SPAMMER?

  A. By definition, SPAM is posting the same or a very similar article to 20 or
  more newsgroups. This is based entirely on quantity, not content. You might
  post the cure for cancer to 20 newsgroups, and it would still be SPAM.

  In addition, some e-mail items are determined by Internet consensus to be
  SPAM, even if someone posts the message only once. This is simply because
  similar articles already have been posted thousands of times. Items in this
  category include pyramid scams, MLM schemes, 1-900 advertisements, and chain
  letters. Sending unsolicited e-mail, especially commercially related e-mail,
  normally is classified as SPAM.

  MSN does not tolerate SPAM sent by its members. If you send SPAM, you may
  receive a warning letter from the MSN Postmaster or MSN Management in a minor
  case. In a more serious case, MSN may terminate your account.

  To avoid becoming a SPAMMER, do not send SPAM.
