The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

While logging on, you may receive the following error:

  SMSRUN16\32 cannot find the file smsrun16.exe or smsrun32.exe or one of its
  components. Make sure the path and filename are correct and that all required
  libraries are available.

CAUSE
=====

This error message appears in situations where you have multiple installations
of an operating system on a computer, or when a computer is upgraded from one
operating system to another and the new operating system is in a different
directory than the old one.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, run the Upgrade.bat file to update the Systems
Management Server client setup.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Systems
Management Server 1.2 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the
service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base
(without the spaces):

  S E R V P A C K

MORE INFORMATION
================

When Systems Management Server verifies client installation, it verifies that
Smsrun16.exe or Smsrun32.exe is on the load= line of the Win.ini file. If
Systems Management Server does not find one of these executable files on the
load= line, it adds the appropriate entry. However, Systems Management Server
does not check to see that one of these executable files is actually located in
the current operating system directory specified by the LocalWindowsPath entry
of the Sms.ini file.

Additional query words: prodsms file name OS
