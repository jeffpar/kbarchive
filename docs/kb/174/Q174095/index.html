-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
- Microsoft Windows 95 OEM Service Release, version 2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a Windows 95-based computer with the Winsock2 Update for Windows 95
installed, IGMP queries may time out prematurely. This may result in computers
that are members of a multicast group being dropped from group membership.

CAUSE
=====

The TCP/IP driver in the Winsock2 Update for Windows 95 does not properly
implement the Max Response Time field as documented in the IGMP version 2 draft.
This behavior may cause clients participating in a multicast group to not
respond to IGMP requests from a router within the timeout period. When this
occurs, the router no longer forwards multicast packets to the expired group
member.

STATUS
======

This issue is resolved by the following updated file for Windows 95 and Windows
95 OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2):

  Vip.386 version 4.10.1512 (dated 7/29/97) and later

To install this update, use the following steps.

NOTE: This update should be applied only to Windows 95-based computers on which
the Winsock2 Update has been installed.

1. Download the Vipup20.exe file from the Microsoft Download Center to an empty
  folder.

2. In My Computer or Windows Explorer, double-click the Vipup20.exe file you
  downloaded in step 1.

3. Follow the instructions on the screen.
