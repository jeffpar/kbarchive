The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In an effort to reduce the amount of network traffic and time required to run
the Systems Management Server logon scripts, Smsls.bat and Runsms.bat, the
initial Systems Management Server client installation now installs many of the
files that were previously located on the Systems Management Server logon server
to the Systems Management Server client's local hard drive.

After the Systems Management Server client is installed, subsequently running the
Systems Management Server script results in much lower network traffic between
the client and the Systems Management Server logon server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following are examples of the approximate drive space consumed by a Systems
Management Server 1.2 client without Service Pack 3 installed:

- Windows 95: 2.7 MB

- Windows NT: 2.9 MB

The following are the drive space requirements after Systems Management Server
1.2 Service Pack 3 is installed:

- Windows 95: 3.8 MB

- Windows NT: 3.2 MB

By moving many files to the client, the number of bytes transferred between a
Windows 95 client and a Systems Management Server logon server has been reduced
by approximately 75 percent. Additionally, client computers running Windows NT
will see almost a 50 percent reduction in network traffic between client and
server.
