RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

2. In the Named box, type "Outbox.*" (without quotation marks), and then click
  Find Now.

3. Rename the Outbox.mbx file and the Outbox.idx file. By default, these files
  are located in the following folder

  C:\Program Files\Internet Mail and News\&lt;username&gt;\Mail

  where &lt;username&gt; is the name you used to log on to Windows.

  For information about how to rename a file, click Start, click Help, click the
  Index tab, type "renaming" (without quotation marks), and then double-click
  the "Renaming files" topic.

4. Double-click the MSN E-Mail icon on the desktop. The Outbox.mbx and
  Outbox.idx files are automatically re-created and Internet Mail should
  function normally.

5. Re-create and re-send any messages that were not delivered before you renamed
  the Outbox.mbx and Outbox.idx files.
