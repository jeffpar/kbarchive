SUMMARY
=======

The purpose of this article is to explain the steps you perform when you run a
knowledge consistency check (KCC) on a Microsoft Exchange Server computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you run a KCC either automatically or from the directory service general
page of a Microsoft Exchange Server computer, perform the following checks and
steps:

1. Bind to the local server.

2. Determine the names of other Exchange Server computers in the local server's
  site.

3. Bind to another server in the site.

4. Check whether this second server has the same server name as any that were
  obtained in Step 2. If not, synchronize the Configuration naming contexts in
  both directions, and repeat with another server until they are all done or
  one of the server names matches.

5. Search the local server for all the writable naming contexts (NC).

6. For each NC, check that there are Reps-to and Reps-from values for each
  server in the site. Fix any missing links.

7. Search the local directory under the local site's directory-replication
  container for connectors.

8. For each connector found, determine whether there is a corresponding remote
  connector locally. In other words, see whether there is a replica of the
  connector in the other site that points back to your local site.

9. If there is a local copy of the remote connector, update the inbound sites on
  the local connector to match the remote connector's outbound sites.

10. Go through the local connectors and construct a list of all sites replicated
  in from all the connectors.

11. Go through the connectors and ensure that they all replicate out all of the
  inbound sites, plus your local site, minus the sites coming in on that
  connector.

12. Search the local directory service for non-writable replicas.

13. Check that you have all the replicas described by the local connectors, add
  any that are missing, and remove any that you should not have.

14. Search the local directory service for authorizations.

15. Verify that you have all the authorizations as described by the connectors,
  and remove any that you should not have.

16. Check that for each intersite replica that you replicate to this directory
  service, you replicate on to all other servers in the site. Remove any
  replicas to non-existent servers.

17. Take replication responsibility for objects last modified by servers that
  have been removed from the site. This is done on a random basis to avoid all
  the servers in the site adopting the same server's objects at the same time.
