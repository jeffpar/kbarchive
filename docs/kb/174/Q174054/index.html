The information in this article applies to:

- The Microsoft Network versions 1.2, 1.3, 2.0, 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect to MSN, The Microsoft Network, you may receive the
following error message:

  Task cannot be completed at this time.

CAUSE
=====

You may not have enough available memory to connect to MSN.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use one of the following methods:

Method 1
--------

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. On the Performance tab, click File System.

4. On the Hard Disk tab, move the Read-Ahead Optimization slider to the 8
  kilobyte position.

5. Click OK, and then click Close. When you are prompted to restart the
  computer, click Yes.

6. Attempt to connect to MSN again.

Method 2
--------

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. On the Performance tab, click Virtual Memory.

4. Click "Let me specify my own virtual memory settings," and then verify that
  the Hard Disk box shows at least 30 megabytes (MB) free.

5. If the Hard Disk box shows less than 30 MB free, you need to increase the
  amount of free hard disk space. Use the following steps:
  a. In the Hard Disk box, click a hard disk that shows at least 30 MB free. If
     you have only one hard disk, or you do not have a hard disk with at least
     30 MB free, increase the amount of free space on your hard disk (or any
     hard disk in your computer), and then click that hard disk in the Hard
     Disk box.

  b. Click OK, and then click Close. When you are prompted to restart the
     computer, click Yes.

6. Attempt to connect to MSN again.

Method 3
--------

1. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click MS-DOS Prompt.

2. Type "mem" (without quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

3. Note the largest executable program size, type "exit" (without quotation
  marks), and then press ENTER.

4. If the largest executable program size is less than 570K (583,680 bytes), you
  need to increase the amount of available conventional memory. For information
  about how to increase conventional memory, please see the following article
  in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
