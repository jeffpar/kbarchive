-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
- the operating system: Microsoft Windows 2000 
- the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word 97, when you save a document as Hypertext Markup Language
(HTML) or when you save a new Web page, you may receive the following warning
message:

  This document contains characters that are not in the current language
  encoding. To preserve them, choose cancel and select the appropriate language
  encoding. For multilingual documents, use UTF-8.

CAUSE
=====

This message appears when your document contains multiple languages. The Word
HTML converter cannot set the correct character set (language encoding) for the
document.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, follow these steps:

1. When you get the warning message described in the "Symptoms" section of this
  article, click OK.

2. On the File menu, click Properties.

3. In the Document Properties dialog box, under "For Saving This Page", click to
  select the correct language set that your document contains, and then click
  OK.

  For example:

   - When your document contains English and Polish, select Central European.

     -or-

   - When your document contains English and Russian, select Cyrillic.

4. On the File menu, click Save.

This sets the language encoding of the document.

If You Have a Problem Completing the Resolution
-----------------------------------------------

To set the correct language encoding, your Word document must be saved in the
HTML file format before you click Properties on the File menu.

To save as HTML, do one of the following:

- On the File menu, click "Save as HTML".

  -or-

- On the File menu, click Save As. In the Save As dialog box, change the "Save
  as type" box to HTML Document, and then click OK.

If the Document Properties dialog box containing the option "For saving this
page" is not displayed when you click Properties on the File menu, or if you are
unable to save as HTML, Word may be experiencing any of the following problems:

- "Save as HTML" missing on the File menu

- HTML Document missing in the "Save as type" box (on the File menu, click Save
  As)

- Damaged or missing Windows Registry settings

- Damaged or missing program files or components

To resolve these problems, use one or more of the following methods:

Method 1: Reinstall Microsoft Word:

To reinstall Microsoft Word, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs. In the list of installed programs, click
  Microsoft Office 97 (Microsoft Word 97), and then click Add/Remove (on
  Microsoft Windows 2000, click Change/Remove). If you installed Microsoft
  Office from a CD, you are prompted to insert the first CD.

3. If a dialog box displays a message that states that programs are running,
  quit the programs, and then click OK.

4. In the Microsoft Office 97 Setup dialog box, click Reinstall.

Method 2: Run Setup with the /y Switch to Correct the Registry:

Setup /y is a switch used by Office Setup and Office program Setup files. It
allows a reinstallation of Office without performing file checks or actually
reinstalling the files. Setup /y re-registers all Office components and returns
the settings to their default values in the registry.

To resolve this problem, try running Setup /y for Word or Office to repair
registry corruption.

To run Setup with the /y switch, follow these steps:

1. Insert the Microsoft Word or Microsoft Office CD-ROM. If you installed Word
  or Office from floppy disks, insert the Setup Disk 1 in your computer's
  floppy disk drive.

2. Click Start, and then click Run.

3. In the Open box, type the following, and then click OK:

  "&lt;drive&gt;:\setup.exe /Y" (without the quotation marks)

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the letter of the drive that contains the CD or Setup
  Disk 1.

4. Click Reinstall.

Method 3: Completely Remove Word and Reinstall:

To completely remove Microsoft Word and reinstall, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs. In the list of installed programs, click
  Microsoft Office 97 (Microsoft Word 97), and then click Add/Remove (on
  Microsoft Windows 2000, click Change/Remove). If you installed Microsoft
  Office from a CD, you are prompted to insert the first CD.

3. If a dialog box displays a message that states that programs are running,
  quit the programs, and then click OK.

4. In the Microsoft Office 97 Setup dialog box, click Remove All.

5. Run the Eraser 97 utility to remove all remaining Office/Word files and to
  delete corresponding registry entries.

Base:

6. When you are prompted to remove shared components, click Remove All.

7. If you are prompted to restart the computer after Setup is completed, restart
  the computer.

8. Re-install either Microsoft Word 97 or Microsoft Office 97 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you save your Web page in Word, the HTML converter writes the language
encoding of the document similar to the following:

  &lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html;
  charset=windows-1252"&gt;

When your document contains text typed in a different language in addition to
English, the document may show incorrect characters when viewed in a Web
browser.

To correctly show text typed in a different language, the document language
encoding must be set to the language typed. If your document contains text typed
in a different language in addition to English, you must specify the specific
language encoding of the additional language.
