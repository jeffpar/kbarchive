SUMMARY
=======

In the Microsoft Windows environment, custom controls are often designed to
store data about their state, color, or position. This data can be stored
directly in window extra bytes associated with the custom control window or in a
local or a global memory object.

If a control uses window extra bytes directly, Windows allocates memory from the
user heap, which is a scarce system resource shared by all applications. In
contrast, the LocalAlloc function allocates memory from the heap of the
application or the dynamic-link library (DLL) in which the control is
implemented.

If six or fewer bytes of data are required for each instance of a custom control,
the demand placed on the system user heap is not large. In contrast, each window
in Windows version 3.0 requires at least 62 bytes of user heap; therefore, using
a small number of window extra bytes is easily justified.

If the control requires more than six bytes of data, the control class should set
the number of window extra bytes to the size of one HANDLE data type. When the
control is created, call the LocalAlloc function to allocate enough memory to
hold the data associated with the control. Store the handle that LocalAlloc
returns in the window extra bytes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Depending on the amount of storage required, storing a handle to a local memory
block in the window extra bytes is usually advantageous. This method requires
calling the LocalAlloc function once at initialization time and calling the
LocalLock and LocalUnlock functions each time the control processes a message
that refers to or modifies any status information. Calling LocalLock and
LocalUnlock is much faster than calling GetWindowWord to access each item of
data.

Storing a memory handle in the window extra bytes also provides the control the
option of using a global memory block if a very large amount of data must be
stored.

Using an allocated memory also allows the application to vary the amount of data
stored for each custom control by storing the size of the structure or an index
that describes the structure at the beginning of the block of memory.
