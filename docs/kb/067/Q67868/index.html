SUMMARY
=======

The NETLOGON.CMD sample logon script for OS/2 LAN Manager version 1.01 contains
system variables %1 - %4. Useful in the creation of global logon scripts, the
variables return these values when included in a script:

  Value      Description
  -----      -----------

  %1         the username of the user logging on
  %2         the computer name of the Netlogon server validating
             logons
  %3         the sharename of the server directory that contains the
             home directories
  %4         the path of the user's home directory relative to %3

These system variables are no longer supplied or supported in logon scripts in
OS/2 LAN Manager version 2.00. This article explains other methods for getting
the functionality they provided.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can obtain all of the %1 through %4 system variable information elements
that were in OS/2 LAN Manager version 1.01 plus many additional information
elements, in OS/2 LAN Manager version 2.00 by means of several API calls,
including NetWkstaGetInfo() and NetUserGetInfo().The APIs are used in a sample
program, SVAR.C.

A Microsoft Software/Data Library article contains these files:

 Filename       Description
  --------       -----------

  SVAR.C         SVAR source code
  SVAROS2.CMD    OS/2 command file used to build SVAR-OS2.EXE
  SVARDOS.BAT    MS-DOS batch file used to build SVAR-DOS.EXE
  SVAR-OS2.EXE   OS/2 version of SVAR (~10K)
  SVAR-DOS.EXE   MS-DOS version of SVAR (~29K)
  SAMPLE.CMD     sample command logon script file that demonstrates
                 how SVAR might be used in an OS/2 LAN Manager logon
                 script

To find SVAR in the Software/Data Library, search on the keyword SVAR, the Q
number of this article, or S12868. SVAR was archived using the PKware
file-compression utility.

SVAR.C uses OS/2 LAN Manager APIs to obtain network information elements:

- workstation's computer name (obtained from local LANMAN.INI file)

- user's logon name (as specified at logon time)

- workstation's default domain (obtained from local LANMAN.INI file)

- user's preferred logon server (from user's account -- if specified)

- user's home directory (from user's account -- if specified)

It creates a temporary .BAT (MS-DOS) or .CMD (OS/2) file in the local
environment's %TEMP% directory, appends each information element to a "SET
&lt;varname&gt; =" string and writes them to a temporary file that can be run
whenever the elements are needed as local system variables. For example, the
temporary batch file can be called from your logon script to set the requested
system variables for use further down in the logon script (see SAMPLE.CMD).

Usage
-----

   {os2}

svar-dos [-c [Computer varname]] [-u [User varname]]
           [-d [Default domain varname]] [-s [Preferred server varname]]
           [-h [Home directory varname]] [-f Temporary file name]

You can provide any combination of the -c, -u, -d, -s, and -h flags (at least one
is required), or you can follow any of the indicated flags with a local system
variable name that you want used in the "set &lt;varname&gt; =" string instead
of these standard information element names:

  -c  COMPUTER
  -u  USER
  -d  DOMAIN
  -s  SERVER
  -h  HOME

By default, the filename for the temporary file is "$x$x$x$x". You can designate
a different filename by using the -f parameter (see the usage listed above).

Example
-------

  svar-dos -c -u USERNAME -d -h HOMEDIR -f tmpfile

If the local workstation's computer name is TW301, the domain is SALES, the
user's logon name is JOE, and JOE's home directory is \\SERVER1\HOME1, this
command creates the following TMPFILE.BAT file in the %TEMP% directory:

  SET COMPUTER=TW301
  SET USERNAME=JOE
  SET DOMAIN=SALES
  SET HOMEDIR=\\SERVER1\HOME1

You can modify SVAR easily to provide additional system variables that may be
needed within the logon script.

For example, if you are configured in a large network installation you may want
to be automatically connected to a departmental (or divisional) word processing
data directory, either at system boot or when you run a word processing
application. One way to do this is to make the department code (and division
code, if needed) available through system variables.

There are a few fields in the user account record, such as "comment" or "parms,"
that can contain additional information elements--such as department and
division code--obtained by parsing the appropriate field (comment, parameters,
etc.) returned by NetUserGetInfo(), and adding them in "set &lt;varname&gt; ="
strings in the temporary .BAT or .CMD file.

You can add a network command such as the following to the logon script (or word
processing application execution batch file) to attach your drive W to the
appropriate departmental word processing share and set the default directory to
the appropriate divisional subdirectory:

  NET USE W: \\WORDPROC1\%department%
  CD W:\%division%

Or, if the servers are departmentalized:

  NET USE W: \\%department%\WORDPROC
  CD W:\%division%

Note: the system variables established by CALLing the temporary .BAT or .CMD file
remain in effect only for the duration of the logon script, so you may want to
keep the file in the %temp% directory for later use by another process (such as
the above mentioned word processing application execution batch file).
