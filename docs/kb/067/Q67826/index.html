SUMMARY
=======

When placing a runway, press 1 or 3 on the numeric keypad to change the heading.
The runway will pivot on a center axis, and can be stopped by pressing 5 on the
numeric keypad.

When rotating the runway, note that the Runway Number field will change to match
the heading. The Runway Number field is only accurate to +/- 5 degrees because
the heading number is rounded to the nearest ten. For example, if the runway is
at a heading of 136, the number appearing in the Runway Number field will be
14/32 (where 14 is the rounded number).

To place a runway, do the following:

1. From the Mode menu, choose option J, Scenery Design.

2. From the Scenery Designer menu, choose option 1, Static Scenery Designer.

3. Choose option G, Add Runways.

4. From the Runways Editor, select the options that you want.

5. Press ENTER.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The reciprocal heading number appears at the opposite end of the runway. For
example, the reciprocal of 14 (140 degrees) is 32 (320 degrees), so the runway
numbers will be 14 on one end and 32 on the other.

Although the Runway Number field will change with the rotation of the runway, the
reverse is not true; changing the Runway Number field will not change the
bearing of the runway. The Runway Number field is included to allow you to place
any number at the end of the runway, regardless of its accuracy.
