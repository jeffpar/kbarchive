SUMMARY
=======

When you select the Save Changes option while exiting the Program Manager, the
layout of the open group windows is saved, but the layout of the closed group
icons is not. These icons are automatically reorganized at the bottom of the
Program Manager the next time Windows is run. You cannot save their screen
positions, but you can save the order in which they appear on the screen.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using an example, the procedure below outlines the steps to order Program
Manager's group icons. Make sure you follow the instructions closely.

Groups in example:

  Main
  Accessories
  Games
  WEP
  SDK Tools
  MS-DOS Apps

Group icons we want to order:

  Games
  Windows Entertainment Pack (WEP)
  SDK Tools
   MS-DOS Apps

Desired order from left to right:

  WEP
  Games
  MS-DOS Apps
  SDK Tools

Procedure
---------

1. Switch to Program Manager.

2. Restore ALL group icons to a window (do not maximize them).

3. Select the group window (from the Window menu is probably easiest at this
  point) that you want to appear on the far right; for example, SDK Tools.

4. Minimize this window to a group icon.

5. Repeat steps 3-4 for the next adjacent group icon; in this case, MS-DOS Apps.

6. Repeat steps 3-4 for the rest of the groups you want to order (first Games,
  then WEP).

  NOTE: At this point, the group icons should be the REVERSE of what you want.

7. Exit Windows and select Save Changes.

8. Run Windows.

  The group icons are now in the proper order. If you want to avoid any further
  screen changes in Program Manager, deselect Save Changes the next time you
  exit Windows .

In a general description, Windows 3.00 Program Manager keeps track of which group
icons you have minimized. The last icon you minimize is put at the BOTTOM LEFT
of the window IF you select Save Changes.

Technically, when you minimize an icon, its "order" is saved in a
"Last-In-First-Out" (LIFO) stack. When you select Save Changes and run Windows
again, Program Manager reads the LIFO stack and places the group icons in the
window from LEFT to RIGHT, BOTTOM to TOP.

This LIFO technique is the reason the group icons were in reverse order after
step 6.
