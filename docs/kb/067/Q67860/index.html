You can use the Microsoft Mouse with Lotus 1-2-3 version 3.1. The
mouse will work correctly with both the COM and SYS versions of the
drivers. Correct mouse use in 1.2.3 release 3.1 depends on whether or
not the memory resident formatting and printing utility WYSIWYG is
properly installed and loaded into memory. Without installation and
loading of WYSIWYG, no mouse cursor will appear on the normal Lotus
1-2-3 screen. If you try use a previous Lotus 1-2-3 Microsoft Mouse
menu or the generic MSMENU, Lotus will not work correctly (for
example, you will get erratic highlights and no cursor).

It appears that in some instances there is a problem with earlier
versions of the mouse driver even when WYSIWYG is correctly installed
and loaded. A possible solution is to update the mouse driver to
MOUSE.COM version 7.04. Another possible solution is to load MOUSE.SYS
version 7.04 with the CONFIG.SYS file.

Correct use of the mouse in Lotus 1-2-3 version 3.1 depends on proper
installation of WYSIWYG, correct hardware configuration, and the right
operating environment.

Installation
------------

The following steps are necessary to ensure that the Microsoft Mouse
will work with Lotus 1-2-3 version 3.1:

 1. Complete installation of the mouse hardware and software. Be sure
    the mouse driver is loaded into memory.

 2. Complete the first-time installation of Lotus 1-2-3 3.1. If you did
    not choose to have the WYSIWYG files transferred to the hard disk
    the first time, you must rerun the installation program from the
    hard disk and choose the option to transfer the WYSIWYG files to
    the hard disk.

 3. After completing the first installation of Lotus 3.1, put the
    Add-In Support Disk into drive A and type "install" (without the
    quotation marks) at the A:&gt; prompt. The installation program will
    place the WYSIWYG files into the default directory C:\123R3\ADDINS.

 4. When this second "install" is complete, go to the C:\123R3
    subdirectory and type "123". This takes you into the normal Lotus
    screen.

 5. Press the ALT+F10 key combination. You will see the Addin menu in
    the Lotus menu bar area.

 6. From the Addin menu, choose Load.

 7. Specify WYSIWYG.PLC as the add-in to read into memory.

 8. Select No-Key.

 9. WYSIWYG is now in memory, and you have a mouse cursor.

10. You can get the regular Lotus menus by selecting Quit or using the
    key combination CTRL+BREAK. You also may toggle between the Addin
    menu and the main Lotus menu by clicking the right mouse button.

Hardware
--------

You must have a mouse and mouse driver as well as a graphics
display monitor and a graphics display card. Lotus 1-2-3 3.1
also requires at least a 286 microprocessor.

Operating Environment
---------------------

Lotus 1-2-3 3.1 requires MS-DOS version 3.00 or later. It will not run
in the DOS compatibility box of OS/2; however, it will run after you
choose the DOS dual-boot option from OS/2. Lotus 1-2-3 3.1 will run
under the DOS option of Windows 3.00 or it can be installed as a
Windows 3.00 application.

Additional Tips
---------------

Microsoft Mouse Driver versions 7.03 and 7.05 will return a white
arrow graphics cursor in Lotus 1-2-3 3.11 while all other mouse driver
versions will return a blue graphics cursor.

To select an item from a menu you must point to the menu item desired
and hold the left mouse button down. Then move the highlight to the
sub-menu choice. When you release the mouse button, the item will be
selected.

In addition to normal mouse cursor movement, you may also move the
mouse cursor by selecting the arrow icons on the right hand side of
the 1-2-3 screen.
