SUMMARY
=======

All Windows version 3.0 and 3.1 display drivers are required to contain certain
bitmaps. These bitmaps are used to paint various windows, controls, and menus.
Handles to these bitmaps can be retrieved with the LoadBitmap() function. Below
is an explanation of the OBM values listed in the Windows include file
WINDOWS.H.

These values are parsed by the C Compiler only if OEMRESOURCE is defined prior to
including WINDOWS.H.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  Sysbit.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/platformsdk/file71/3.1/W31/EN-US/SYSBIT.EXE)

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

Because Windows buttons have two states, normal and depressed (the mouse pointer
is over the icon and the mouse button is down), the first seven shapes (bitmaps)
have two forms, the normal image and the depressed image. Both images are used
to create the illusion of three dimensions on the screen when a button is
pressed. The names of depressed images end with the letter "D"; the other images
do not.

The last eleven bitmaps are no longer used by Windows, but must be supplied for
compatibility with applications that expect them to be available.

Windows 3.1 Bitmaps
-------------------

The following four bitmaps are new for Windows 3.1:

  NOTE: The SYSBIT sample does not display these bitmaps, but they are
  illustrated in the documentation (as are the rest of the bitmaps listed
  below) for the LoadBitmap() function in the Windows SDK.
