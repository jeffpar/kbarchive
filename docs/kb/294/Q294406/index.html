-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

When an Outlook user sends a meeting request to a user who uses a Post Office
Protocol version 3 (POP3) or Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) client,
that user may not be able to open the meeting request in the POP3 or IMAP
client. The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) for the meeting request may not
work.

This behavior occurs if Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) is configured to use
only Secure Sockets Layer (SSL); the meeting request URL that is generated for
the POP3 or IMAP clients is stamped with "http:" rather than "https:".

MORE INFORMATION
================

A supported feature that modifies the product's default behavior is now
available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to modify the behavior
described in this article and should be applied only to systems having a
specific need for it. This feature may receive additional testing at a later
time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you are not severely
affected by the lack of this feature, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the
next Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 service pack that contains this
feature.

To obtain this feature immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services.
For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information on support costs, please go to the following address on the World
Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

The English version of this feature should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Information Store

+-------------------------+
| File name | Version     | 
+-------------------------+
| Store.exe | 5.5.2654.81 | 
+-------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, this feature requires Microsoft Exchange
Server version 5.5 Service Pack 4.



After you apply this Store.exe feature fix, if OWA is configured to use SSL only,
you need to edit the registry on the Exchange Server computer.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
If OWA is configured to use SSL only, perform the following steps on the Exchange
Server computer:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate and click the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersPrivate

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

  Value name: OWA Url Protocol
  Data type: Reg_SZ
  Value data: https:

4. Quit Registry Editor.

NOTE: Data must end with a colon (:).
