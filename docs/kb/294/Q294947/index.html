SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail, the service
may stop immediately. The following event ID messages may be logged in the
Application event log:

  Event ID: 43
  Source: MSExchangeCCMC
  Type: Error
  Description: The Lotus cc:Mail IMPORT/EXPORT.EXE programs could not be
  executed. Check to see that they exist on the server and are in the system
  path. The system error code is 2. The system cannot find the file specified.

  -and-

  Event ID: 86
  Source: MSExchangeCCMC
  Type: Information
  Description: Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail restarted thread
  after taking exception. The number of threads started so far is XX. The
  thread function is dwCCExport. (XX= number of times up to 25, then we get an
  85)

  -and-

  Event ID: 85
  Source: MSExchangeCCMC
  Type: Error
  Description: The maximum number the thread restarts has been reached and the
  Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail will be shutdown. Try

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the Lotus cc:Mail Import and Export programs, Import.exe
and Export.exe, are not present in a folder in the system path.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, copy the following items from the cc:Mail Administrator
folder to a folder in the system path:

- Import.exe

- Export.exe

- Ie.ri (the Import and Export resource information file)

MORE INFORMATION
================

To troubleshoot the Connector for cc:Mail, open a command prompt, go to the
%Systemroot%\Exchsrvr\Connect\Ccmail\Bin folder, press Enter, and then run the
following command:

  ccmc &gt;output.txt

When you run this command when the event IDs that are listed in the "Symptoms"
section of this article occur, an Output.txt file is created in the
%Systemroot%\Exchsrvr\Connect\Ccmail\Bin folder that contains data that looks
similar to the following text:
