SYMPTOMS
========

End users may be unable to log on to their IBM AS/400 after changing their
Windows NT or Windows 2000 password if SNA Server or Host Integration Server
2000 is configured to replicate password changes to the AS/400. The following
events will be logged in the Application Event log when this occurs:

  Event ID: 1506
  Source: SNA Host Security
  Description: Security DLL could not establish network connection to host side
  components.

  Event ID: 6005
  Source: AS400 MDSI
  Description: The SNA APPC service returned the following error when attempting
  an operation for &lt;userid&gt; in the &lt;Host Security Domain name&gt;
  domain:

  The userid or password is not valid. Try again or contact System
  Administrator.

Similar events would be logged if SNA Server or Host Integration Server 2000 is
configured to replicate password changes to an IBM mainframe instead of an
AS/400.

CAUSE
=====

The password synchronization fails if the user changing his or her Windows NT or
Windows 2000 password has an uninitialized password in the Host Account Cache
(HAC) database.

messages, click the article numbers below to view the articles in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q232035 AS/400 Password Change Using Host Security May Not Complete

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem can be avoided if users are added to the Host Account Cache
database through the use of the Host Account Manager (Udconfig.exe) tool, which
is included with SNA Server and Host Integration Server 2000. The user's Windows
password is specified when the user is added to the Host Account Cache database,
which prevents an uninitialized password from being sent to the host system.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Host security domains (HSD) are configured in SNA Manager. A Host Security
Domain Wizard is provided to simplify the process of creating an HSD. Each HSD
represents a "host" user database. When configured initially, an HSD is assigned
to a particular host connection. Within the Host Account Cache (HAC) database,
each user's record contains an entry for every host security domain of which
they are a member.

When a host security domain is created, a Windows 2000 (or Windows NT) user group
must be created with the same name. Users who are members of this group can
cache information in the Host Account Cache database for this HSD. A second
group is also created that appends "_Proxy" to the HSD name for its group name.
Members of the "&lt;HSD name&gt;_Proxy" group can use the APPC Privileged Proxy
feature.

For example, if a host security domain called "AS400" is created, the Host
Security Domain Wizard will create the following Windows 2000 (or Windows NT)
groups:

- AS400

- AS400_Proxy

The Host Security Domain Wizard adds the &lt;domain&gt;\Domain Users group to the
HSD group (in this case, AS400) when an HSD is created. Users in this group are
authorized to populate host user IDs and passwords to the HAC database. The HSD
Wizard adds the &lt;domain&gt;\Domain Admins group to the "_Proxy" HSD group
when an HSD is created.

Users that are not explicitly added to the Host Account Cache database will be
added dynamically when they change their Windows 2000 (or Windows NT) password
if they are members of the HSD group. Because the Domain Users group is added to
the HSD group, by default every user in the Windows 2000 (or Windows NT) domain
is a valid host security domain member.

If the HSD is configured to replicate passwords to a host system (IBM AS/400s or
IBM mainframes), the host security components will replicate a user's new
Windows password to the host system when the password is changed. If the user
has not been explicitly added to the HAC database, the user will be dynamically
added to the HAC database when the user changes his or her password.

When a user is added dynamically, the HAC database does not have any way to get
the user's previous Windows password, and the user's new Windows password won't
be sent to the HAC database until later. In this case, the HAC database has an
"uninitialized" Windows password for the user.

As the password synchronization process continues, the user's previous password
must be obtained from the HAC database because it is needed to log on to the
host system in order to have the password change to the new password. Because
the HAC database does not have the user's previous password, it returns a
default "uninitialized" value for the user's previous Windows password.

The logon to the host system fails because the previous password (the
"uninitialized" value) is not valid. This causes an error to be returned to the
SNA Server or Host Integration Server 2000, resulting in the events listed in
the "Symptoms" section of this article when an attempt is made to connect to the
host system.
