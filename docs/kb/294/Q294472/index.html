-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Index Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Index Server 2.0 has an unchecked buffer in a function that processes search
requests. If an overly long value is provided for a particular search parameter,
it overruns the buffer. If the buffer is overrun with random data, it causes
Index Service to fail. If it is overrun with carefully selected data, code of
the attacker's choice can be made to run on the server in the Local System
security context.

Mitigating Factors:

- To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker must be able to authenticate to
  the server and to create a named pipe connection to it (which requires access
  to NetBIOS, which should be blocked at the firewall). As a result, it is
  likely that this vulnerability can, in a properly configured network, only be
  exploited by an intranet user.

- Index Server 2.0 installs by default as part of the Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
  Option Pack, but it does not run by default.

- Indexing Services in Microsoft Windows 2000 is not affected by this
  vulnerability.
