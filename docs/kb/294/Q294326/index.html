Last Modified: 08-MAY-2002

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP6, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows NT-based server that is running Terminal Server may log the following
error in the System event log:

  Event ID: 1003
  Source: TermService
  Type: Information
  The terminal service client has provided an invalid license.

CAUSE
=====

A corrupted or invalid license is being supplied by the client when it connects
to the Terminal Server-based server.


The event log does not specify the client computer that provided the invalid
license. One way to determine which client supplied the invalid license is to
audit Logon and Logoff events, and then compare the System event log and the
Security event log.

This problem may not occur in later versions of Windows NT.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, service pack that contains
this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or

Service Pack 6 (SP6).
