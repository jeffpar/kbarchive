-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you set up WordPerfect version 5.1 or 5.2 for Windows, WordPerfect does not
correctly add a file association under Microsoft Windows. As a result, versions
3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows does not receive or send
attachments correctly.

By default, WordPerfect for Windows does not establish extensions for its files.
The result of this is that you are not able to attach files, nor can you see the
WordPerfect icon. Instead, you will see a document icon with a folded
upper-right corner and the document name below it.

When you try to open the file, the following error message is displayed in a
dialog box labeled Microsoft Mail:

  Stop. The application for the attached file &lt;filename&gt; (or one of its
  components) could not be found.

CAUSE
=====

The error is not from Mail for Windows, but is the result of the WordPerfect for
Windows file not having any association within Windows.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following are two methods to establish an association for WordPerfect for
Windows files:

Method 1
--------

1. Using any ASCII editor, open the WIN.INI file.

2. Find the [Extensions] section.

3. Using one of the default entries as a template, add the new WordPerfect
  extension.

4. Close Windows and restart to force a reread of the WIN.INI.

Method 2
--------

1. From File Manager, select the file with the desired extension.

2. From the File menu, choose Associate.

3. Either choose the program from the list box or use the Browse feature to find
  WPWIN.EXE.

NOTE: Method 2 automatically makes the WIN.INI entry and the registration
database modifications without the need to close and restart Windows.

You need to complete one of the above methods at every workstation where you want
this feature. When you have finished establishing an association for WordPerfect
for Windows files, users attaching or receiving WordPerfect documents with the
appropriate extensions will see the WordPerfect for Windows icon.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To successfully use the Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) feature of Mail for
Windows, Windows must have a file association to work with. It is important to
understand that Windows cannot associate a file whose filename does not have a
three-letter extension.

Administrators can choose any number of file associations, within the limits of
the WIN.INI file size, according to your needs. Once these associations are
chosen, you need to add them to the Windows WIN.INI file.
