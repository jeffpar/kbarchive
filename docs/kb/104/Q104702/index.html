-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft
DriveSpace. For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for
commands and file names.

SUMMARY
=======

In the [SpecialFiles] section of the DBLSPACE.INF file, you can exclude files
and/or directories from being compressed during the DoubleSpace installation.
However, if you use the IGNORE= statement to exclude an entire directory,
DoubleSpace does not automatically exclude subdirectories of that named
directory from compression. Also, files that do not have an extension and are
located in a directory specified by an IGNORE statement are moved to the
compressed drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The [SpecialFiles] section of the DBLSPACE.INF file was designed to designate
individual files that should not be compressed (with wildcard functionality
[such as the * character] built-in). Thus, files only (not directories) are
recognized in the [SpecialFiles] section.

In the DBLSPACE.INF file, if you want to exclude an entire directory and all of
its subdirectories from being compressed, you must first specify the top-level
directory and then specify each subdirectory separately. For example, if the
following directory tree structure exists before compression

  C:
  +---DOS
  +---TEST
      +---T1
      +---T2
          +---T3

the following lines must be added to the [SpecialFiles] section of DBLSPACE.INF
to exclude the TEST directory and its subdirectories:

  IGNORE=C:\TEST\*.*
  IGNORE=C:\TEST\T1\*.*
  IGNORE=C:\TEST\T2\*.*
  IGNORE=C:\TEST\T2\T3\*.*

Files Without Extensions Are Still Moved
----------------------------------------

Files that do not have an extension and are located in a directory specified by
an IGNORE statement are still moved to the compressed drive. For example, if you
have a directory of all Windows for Workgroups 3.11 files and you specify in the
DRVSPACE.INF to IGNORE this directory, the following files are still moved:

  DISK1, DISK2, DISK3, DISK4, DISK5, DISK6, WINVER, DISK7, DISK8

This problem occurs only with files that do not have an extension. Files that
include an extension of one or more characters are not moved.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in MS-DOS versions 6.0, 6.2, and
6.22. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

DBLSPACE.INF Does Not Recognize More Than 18 Ignore Statements
--------------------------------------------------------------

DoubleSpace does not recognize more than 18 IGNORE statements in your
DBLSPACE.INF file. Subsequent IGNORE statements are not processed.
