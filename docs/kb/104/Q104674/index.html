SUMMARY
=======

Interrupt handlers in assembler may either stand alone or use the old interrupt
handler for functions not covered by the new handler. Using the old handler is
called chaining, and is needed for many MS-DOS and BIOS interrupts. A handler
that does not chain uses an IRET (interrupt return) statement rather than a
normal return statement (RET, RETN, RETF).

There are two ways to chain to an old interrupt handler:

- Jumps are used when the chain is the last thing in your new handler, and in
  this case your handler's IRET statement is never executed.

-or-

- Calling the old handler is done when you need to return to your handler for
  further processing after the original handler has finished. In this case,
  your return statement is very important.

The difference between IRET and RET is that IRET pops an extra 2 bytes off the
stack (the flags register is popped). An interrupt call always pushes the flags
onto the stack before pushing on the far return address. In general, hardware
interrupt handlers use an IRET statement while software interrupt handlers use a
RETF 2 (far return) statement.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Interrupt handlers that chain to Interrupt 21h are special cases because they
always chain to the old interrupt. If they didn't chain, they would need to
provide replacements for all of the MS-DOS functions, which would essentially
involve rewriting the operating system. If the chaining is done at the end of
the new handler using a JMP instruction, no special return is needed. In fact,
the return statement in the new handler is never executed.

Most software interrupts, including interrupt 21h functions, set the flags to
particular values, and those values are used as part of the returned information
from the handler. The original values are not restored from the stack when the
interrupt returns. IRET is not used. Instead, a RETF 2 statement is used to do a
far return and pop 2 bytes off the stack.

If an Interrupt 21h handler chains to the original handler using a CALL
statement, it must not use IRET. The system will probably hang if you have an
IRET in the handler because some functions may be called repeatedly by MS-DOS
until a certain flag is returned. Executing IRET restores the prior values of
the flags and destroys any values set by the Interrupt 21h call. Thus, it
appears as if the flags never get set, so an infinite loop results.

If the code after the CALL in your Interrupt 21h handler modifies the flags, you
may need to put a PUSHF ... POPF around that code. The sample code below creates
a "do-nothing" replacement for Interrupt 21h and illustrates these points. If
the "RETF 2" is replaced with an IRET, a system hang will result.

Sample Code
-----------

  ; assembly options needed: none
     .MODEL tiny, pascal, os_dos
     .STACK
     .CODE
     .STARTUP

  FPFUNC  TYPEDEF FAR PTR
  Old_INT_21   FPFUNC  ?     ; Data in code segment
                             ; holds old interrupt address.

     jmp SetNewInterrupt     ; Skip the new handler.
  New_INT_21 PROC    FAR
     ; May do some work here.
     ; If nothing needs to be done after the old
     ; handler is called, a jump can be used as follows:
     ;    jmp cs:Old_INT_21
     ; If the jump is used, the remaining code is not executed.
     cli                          ; Interrupts off.
     pushf
     call    cs:Old_INT_21        ; Call original handler.
     pushf
     ; Chance to do other things.
     popf
     retf 2
  New_INT_21 ENDP

  SetNewInterrupt PROC

     mov     dx, OFFSET New_INT_21   ; Offset of new handler into dx.
     mov     ax, 2521h
     int     21h                     ; Install new 21h handler.
     pop     ds                      ; Restore ds.
