-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
- Microsoft FoxPro for Windows, versions 2.5, 2.5a, 2.6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

FoxPro for Windows will only send data with a precision of two decimal places to
Microsoft Graph. In other words, numeric fields that contain more than two
decimal places will be rounded to just two places. The settings for the SET
DECIMALS TO and SET FIXED commands have no effect on this behavior.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by a limitation in the way that the GraphWizard sends
data to MS Graph.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected in Visual FoxPro for
Windows version 3.0b.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The results of a query in the RQBE window can be sent to a graph by selecting
Graph from the Output list box. The GraphWizard then takes over and provides
direction on the creation of the graph/chart.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new database that has one character field and two numeric fields.
  The fields can have the default width of ten. However, make sure the numeric
  fields have three decimal places.

2. Add three records to the database. In the character field, enter the letters
  A, B, and C. Enter any number for the numeric fields, as long as it has three
  decimal places. (NOTE: The third decimal place should not be zero.)

3. In the Command window, issue the following command:

  USE &lt;database&gt;

4. From the Run menu, choose New Query. In the Output list box, select Graph.

5. Choose Do Query. The GraphWizard will take over and provide guidance on the
  creation of the chart. For purposes of reproducing this problem, choose Next
  three times. You should now be at the screen that says "Here's your graph!"

6. Choose the Zoom button to open the graph in a window by itself. Double-click
  the graph to start up MS Graph.

  When MS Graph is open, there will be two windows. The graph will be in a
  window in front and will say "FoxPro(####)-Chart" in the title bar. The
  window in the background will contain the datasheet and will say
  "FoxPro(####)-Datasheet" in the title bar.

7. Activate the Datasheet window. Select (highlight) the cells that contain
  numbers either by using the mouse or by using the arrow keys while holding
  down the SHIFT key.

8. From the Format menu, choose Number. In the Format box at the bottom of the
  dialog box, type "0.000" (without the quotation marks). This is a custom
  number format that will display three decimal places. Choose OK.

The datasheet for the graph will now display the numbers with three decimal
places. Note that the third decimal place is always zero. The numbers have been
rounded. You can manually enter additional decimal places in Graph, but they
will not automatically transfer over from FoxPro due to the limitation in the
GraphWizard.
