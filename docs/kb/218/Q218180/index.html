The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use static HTML pages (for example, Default.htm), a Content-Location
header is added to the response. By default, in Internet Information Server
(IIS) 4.0, the Content-Location references the IP address of the server rather
than the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) or Hostname.

This header may expose internal IP addresses that are usually hidden or masked
behind a Network Address Translation (NAT) Firewall or proxy server.

Example:

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Server: Microsoft-IIS/4.0
  Content-Location: http://10.1.1.1/Default.htm
  Date: Thu, 18 Feb 1999 14:03:52 GMT
  Content-Type: text/html
  Accept-Ranges: bytes
  Last-Modified: Wed, 06 Jan 1999 18:56:06 GMT
  ETag: "067d136a639be1:15b6"
  Content-Length: 4325

In this example, the Content-Location specifies the private internal address of
the IIS computer within the header. This header is then unchanged when it passes
through a firewall or proxy server. Therefore, the security of the internal
network may be compromised by exposing the network addresses that are being
used.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is a value that can be modified in the IIS metabase to change the default
behavior from exposing IP addresses to send the FQDN instead. This allows the IP
address to be masked by the domain name.

Example:

  HTTP/1.1 200 OK
  Server: Microsoft-IIS/4.0 or Microsoft-IIS/5.0
  Content-Location: http://www.domain.com/Default.htm
  Date: Thu, 18 Feb 1999 15:08:44 GMT
  Content-Type: text/html
  Accept-Ranges: bytes
  Last-Modified: Mon, 30 Nov 1998 15:40:15 GMT
  ETag: "f07f84b9771cbe1:3068"
  Content-Length: 4739

WARNING: Using the Adsutil.vbs file incorrectly causes serious problems that
requires you to reinstall Internet Information Server 4.0. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of the Adsutil.vbs file
can be solved. Use the Adsutil.vbs file at your own risk. To set the value on an
IIS 4.0 server, do the following:

1. Open a command window (cmd).

2. Change directory to: winnt\system32\inetsrv\adminsamples.

  NOTE: This may vary depending on your installation of Internet Information
  Server.

3. Type the following syntax:

  adsutil set w3svc/UseHostName True

  By default, this value is set to False, so it returns only the IP address of
  the IIS computer. Setting this value to True returns the Fully Qualified
  Domain Name (FQDN) for the IIS computer.

4. It is recommended that the Inetinfo service is restarted after making this
  modification. To stop the Inetinfo process, type the following at the command
  line:

  net stop iisadmin /y

  NOTE: Make a note of what services are being stopped so that they can be
  restarted.

5. Type the following:

  Net start w3svc

  NOTE: This is the mininum to allow the Web server to operate again. Any other
  services depends on what is installed for IIS/SiteServer that was taken note
  of in step 4.

To set the value on an IIS 5.0 server, do the following:

1. Open a command window (cmd).

2. Change the directory to: inetpub\adminscripts.

  NOTE: This may vary depending on your installation of Internet Information
  Server.

3. Type the following syntax:

  adsutil set w3svc/UseHostName True

  By default, this value is set to False, so it returns only the IP address of
  the IIS computer. Setting this value to True returns the Fully Qualified
  Domain Name (FQDN) for the IIS computer.

4. It is recommended that the Inetinfo service be restarted or reboot after
  making this modification. To stop the Inetinfo process type the following at
  the command line:

  net stop iisadmin /y

  NOTE: Make a note of what services are being stopped so that they may also be
  restarted.

5. Type the following:

  Net start w3svc

  NOTE: This is the mininum to allow the Web server to operate again. Any other
  services will depend on what is installed for IIS/SiteServer that was taken
  note of in step 4.

WORKAROUND
==========

Another way to work around this issue is to use Active Server Pages instead of
static html pages (.htm or .html) and create a custom header that sends back a
specific Content-Location. The Active Server Pages (ASP) engine does not return
a Content-Location when the response is built, so the ability to add a custom
one is there.

To implement this workaround, follow these steps:

1. Rename all static pages (for example, htm or html) to .asp. This will force
  the pages through the ASP engine.

2. Start the Internet Service Manager (ISM) to load the IIS snap-in for the
  Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

3. Click the plus sign (+) next to Internet Information Server to expand it.

4. Click the plus sign (+) next to ServerName.

5. Right-click Default Web Site, and then click Properties.

6. Click the HTTP Headers tab.

7. In the Custom HTTP Headers section, click Add.

8. Type "Content Location" (without the quotation marks) in the Custom Header
  Name.

9. Type "http://www.domain.com/" (example only) (without the quotation marks) in
  Custom Header Value

10. Click OK twice.
