-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You can use Certificate Server to issue certificates for use with the Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL). This is typically done on a local intranet, where you have
the ability to directly inform your clients that they can trust your
certificates.

MORE INFORMATION
================

IIS supports the SSL 3.0 protocol, which uses certificates to identify both the
client and server during communication, and to establish a one-time session key
to encrypt and decrypt data transmitted during that particular communication
session.

You can use Certificate Server 1.0, which is a component of the Windows NT Option
Pack, to issue certificates for your clients to use.

Before SSL can be used, the following tasks must be performed on the server:

1. Create a Root CA Certificate on the server.

2. Install the Root CA Certificate on the server.

3. Create a Key Certificate Request for the server.

4. Process the Key Certificate Request for the server.

5. Install the Key Certificate on the server.

6. Secure the directory on the server.

Next, perform the following tasks on the client:

1. Install the Root CA Certificate on the client.

2. Install a Certificate on the client.

3. Connect to the SSL-Secured directory from the client.

NOTE: Each of the tasks listed above correspond to a section below. Go to that
section for details on how to perform that particular task.

Creating a Root CA Certificate on the Server
--------------------------------------------

To create a root CA certificate on the server, simply perform the default
installation of the Certificate Server component of the Windows NT Option Pack.
The default installation automatically creates a root CA certificate.

NOTE: If you choose to use Advanced Configuration, do NOT select the Non-root CA
option.

Installing the Root CA Certificate on the Server
------------------------------------------------

1. Browse to http://localhost/certsrv/, click the Certificate Enrollment Tools
  link, and then click the Install Certificate Authority Certificates link.

2. Click the Refresh button to verify that the information displayed is current,
  and then click the "Certificate for &lt;ComputerName&gt;\&lt;CA-Name&gt;"
  link.

3. In the File Download dialog box, select the "Open this file from its current
  location" radio button, and then click OK.

  Perform the following steps if Windows NT 4.0, SP4 or SP5 is installed:

  a. In the Certificate dialog box, click the Install Certificate button.

  b. When the Certificate Manager Import Wizard starts, click Next.

  c. When prompted to select a certificate store, select the "Place all
     certificates into the following store" radio button, and then click
     Browse.

  d. Select the Show Physical Stores option, open Trusted Root Certificate
     Authorities, and then click Local Computer. Click OK.

  e. Click Next, and then click Finish. Click OK to close the dialog box.

  f. Restart the server to cause the root CA certificate to take effect.

  For additional information, please see the following article(s) in the
  Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q194788 Windows NT Service Pack 4 and Client Certificates

  Perform the following steps if Windows NT 4.0, SP3 is installed:

  a. In the New Site Certificate dialog box, click OK (you will typically want
     to leave all of the check boxes selected).

  b. When prompted by "Do you want to ADD the following certificate to the Root
     Store?", click Yes.

  c. At a command prompt, use the CD command to change directories to the
     %SystemRoot%\System32\InetSrv directory (for example, type "cd
     \winnt\system32\inetsrv" (without the quotation marks) if your system root
     is \winnt).

  d. Type "iisca" (without the quotation marks), to synchronize the root CA
     certificate stores used by IIS and Internet Explorer.

  e. Force the registry to be re-read, so that the new root CA certificate is
     recognized. This is done by either restarting the server, or stopping the
     IISADMIN service and its dependent services (for example WWW, FTP, NNTP,
     SMTP, and so on) and then restarting the dependent services that you use.
     These services can be stopped and restarted by doing either of the
     following:

      - Open Control Panel, open Services, and then stop and restart the
        services.

     -OR-

      - Run NET STOP and NET START commands at a command prompt. To do this,
        perform the following:

        1. At a command prompt, type "net stop iisadmin /y" (without the
           quotation marks) to stop the IISADMIN service and its dependent
           services.

        2. Restart the dependent services you use. For example, to restart the
           WWW service, type "net start w3svc" (without the quotation marks).
           To restart FTP, type "net start msftpsvc" (without the quotation
           marks).

Creating a Key Certificate Request for the Server
-------------------------------------------------

1. Start the Internet Service Manager (ISM), which loads the Internet
  Information Server snap-in for the Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

2. Right-click the Web site, directory, or file to be secured, and then click
  Properties. Click the Directory Security (or File Security) tab.

3. Under Secure Communications, click the Key Manager button.

  NOTE: This button will labeled "Edit" instead of "Key Manager" if a
  certificate has already been installed.

4. In Key Manager, right-click WWW, and then click "Create New Key".

5. Click the "Put the request in a file that you will send to an authority"
  radio button, and then save the file to your hard disk. Be sure to remember
  the name and location of the file.

  NOTE: C:\NewKeyRq.txt is the default path and name for this file.

6. Step through the rest of the Create New Key dialog boxes.

  NOTE: When prompted for your state, be sure to spell it out completely (do not
  use the abbreviation), with proper capitalization, so that the certificate
  request will be PKCS #10 compatible.

7. Close the Key Manager, being sure to click Yes when prompted to "Commit all
  changes now?"

8. In the MMC, click OK.

Processing the Key Certificate Request for the Server
-----------------------------------------------------

1. Open the text file created for the server request (C:\NewKeyRq.txt by
  default).

2. Select and copy the text for the key, beginning with the line:

  -----BEGIN NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----

  and ending with:

  -----END NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----

  (in other words, include both of these lines).

3. Browse to http://localhost/certsrv/, click the Certificate Enrollment Tools
  link, and then click the Process a Certificate Request link.

4. On the Web Server Enrollment page, paste the text from the key into the text
  box, and then click Submit Request.

  If you receive the following error message:

  Error!!! Certificate Server is unable to process your request. Last status
  error code = 57.

  See the following Knowledge Base article for more information:

  Q255981 Processing the Key Certificate Request for the Server Fails

5. When the certificate has been successfully processed, click the Download
  button.

6. Click the "Save this file to disk" radio button, and then save the file. Be
  sure to remember the name and location of the file.

  NOTE: Newcert.cer is the default name for this file.

Installing the Key Certificate on the Server
--------------------------------------------

1. In the MMC, right-click the Web site, directory, or file to be secured, and
  then click Properties. Click the Directory Security (or File Security) tab.

2. Under Secure Communications, click the Edit button (note that this changed
  from previously being labeled Key Manager). Now click the Key Manager button.

3. In Key Manager, right-click the new key request (the icon with a red slash
  through it), and then click Install Key Certificate.

4. Select the certificate file, and then when prompted, provide the password.
  Click OK.

5. In the Server Bindings dialog box, "Any Unassigned" should be displayed under
  both the IP Address and Port Number columns. Click OK (unless you want to
  assign the key to particular IP address and port number).

6. Close Key Manager and make sure to click Yes when prompted to "Commit all
  changes now?"

7. Click OK twice to return to the MMC.
