-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Internet Service Manager (ISM), which loads the Internet Information Server
snap-in for the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) does not work through a
firewall.

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. If the MMC ISM was configured to operate through a firewall
using TCP port-based security alone, particularly by opening additional TCP
ports, it could potentially expose sensitive configuration information to the
Internet.

The HTMLA uses TCP port 80, which is open on most firewalls for Web traffic and
sites.

HTTP and FTP are well defined by firewalls, which make these protocols more
secure.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, do one of the following:

Use HTMLA over SSL
------------------

Use the HTML version of the Internet Service Manager (also known as the HTML
Administration or HTMLA) over SSL. This uses HTTP-based security, which will
require additional configurations mentioned in the online documentation for the
Windows NT Option Pack.

-OR-

Use the ISM MMC over PPTP
-------------------------

Use Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) to tunnel through the firewall. The
ISM MMC can be used on the secure PPTP connection. This will also require
additional configurations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following error messages may occur when you attempt to specify TCP ports for
the ISM MMC to use through a firewall:

  The World Wide Web Publishing Service service is starting.
  The World Wide Web Publishing Service service could not be started.
  A system error has occurred.
  System error 1721 has occurred.
  Not enough resources are available to complete this operation.
