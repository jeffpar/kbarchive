SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how you can troubleshoot CD-ROM or DVD-ROM optical disc
read issues. The steps in this article generally apply to compact disc
recordable (CD-R) and compact disc re-writable (CD-RW) drives. Often a drive can
read most but not all discs, but this alone does not indicate that a disc is
bad. The drive could be having a marginal problem.

You may encounter various disc read errors when you attempt to setup or start a
program, when you switch discs while using programs with multiple discs, or when
a program attempts to read data from another area on the disc. You may receive a
variety of errors indicating problems reading the disc or copying specific
files. You may receive messages similar to the following:

  &lt;program&gt; is not a valid win32 application.

  -or-

  A device attached to the system is not functioning.

  -or-

  A required file kernl32.dll was not found.

  -or-

  Not enough memory to run this application.

  -or-

  Cannot find the file(s) needed to start this application.

  -or-

  Error Reading From File [Installer Error 1305]

  -or-

  Unable to find Setup.exe

  -or-

  CDR-101

  -or-

  Unable to read drive D:

  -or-

  Insufficient Memory

A Disc read problem may also trigger Illegal Operations, including General
Protection Faults, Invalid Page Faults or "encountered a problem" messages
(Watson errors). You may receive messages similar to the following:

  Disc label does not appear in My Computer or the contents of the disc will
  not display.

  -or-

  Inserting or reading a disc causes the computer to stop responding.

  -or-

  The disc will not eject.

  -or-

  Takes an exceptionally long time to install or initialize the disc.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To troubleshoot disc read errors, use the following methods in the order in
which they are presented.

Inspect the Disc
----------------

Inspect the disc for visible deformation or substantial scratches. If the disc is
damaged, see the section "Obtaining a Replacement Disc" below.

If you experience problems with a DVD disc, make sure that you insert the DVD
into a DVD drive instead of a CD-ROM drive.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Clean the Disc
--------------

Clean the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM. To do this, use a disc cleaning kit, or gently wipe
the silver side of the disc with a soft, lint-free cotton cloth. Do not use
paper cloth which can scratch the plastic and leave streaks. When you clean the
disc, wipe from the center of the disc outward. Do not use a circular motion.

If the issue continues to occur, clean the disc with a damp cloth or a commercial
CD or DVD cleaning solution. Dry the disc thoroughly before you insert it into
the drive.


If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Test the Disk in another Drive
------------------------------

Try the CD-ROM or DVD disk in another drive. For DVDs, ensure the drive has a DVD
logo on the front of the drive. If the disc works in this test, then the problem
may be with the original drive not properly reading the disc. Please seek help
from your computer or disc drive manufacturer. If your computer has multiple
CD-ROM, CD-R, CD/RW or DVD drives, test the disc in the other drive.

If after cleaning the disc, it does not work on another computer then it is
likely bad and needs replacing. See the section "Obtaining a Replacement Disc"
below. If you see the same issues with a replacement disc as with the original
disc, proceed to the next method.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Clean the Drive
---------------

If cleaning the CD-ROM or DVD does not resolve the issue, clean the disc drive
using a CD-ROM or DVD drive cleaning disc if you have one. If you do not have
one, obtain one after all other steps in this article have failed to resolve the
issue. Drive cleaning discs are available in most computer or home electronics
stores.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Quit Unnecessary Software
-------------------------

Other applications may interfere with the reading of the disc, for example,
anti-virus, firewall or anti-crash software.

1. Quit all visible programs.

2. Right-click each icon in the Taskbar area (near the Windows clock), then
  click Exit, Quit, Close, Disable, etc if available.

3. Press CTRL+ALT+DEL to display the Close Program window. If any program other
  than Explorer is listed, click it, then click Remove. Repeat this step until
  all programs except Explorer have been removed. Explorer is the Windows user
  interface.


If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Look for Known Issues with the Drive or Recording Software
----------------------------------------------------------

Search the Microsoft Knowledge Base for your brand and model of CD-ROM or DVD
drive. Known issues with specific drives may be found in the Knowledge Base.

If your computer includes CD-R or CD/RW recording (burning) software or
packet-writing software, search the Microsoft Knowledge Base for known issues
with the software. Occasionally there are conflicts depending on the version of
the software or with specific drives.


The Microsoft Knowledge Base is available at the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com

Check for Drive Firmware Updates
--------------------------------

Check with the manufacturer of your computer or disc drive to see if software
updates for your drive are available. Often these are called "firmware" updates.
Occasionally updates are issued that can resolve problems where the drive can
read most but not all discs.

Make Sure You Are Using Protected Mode Drivers
----------------------------------------------

If you have Windows 95 or Windows 98, ensure that you are using protected mode
(32-bit) drivers for your CD-ROM or DVD drive. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. On the Performance tab, confirm that the File System entry is 32-bit. If the
  File System entry is "Some drives are using MS-DOS compatibility" you are
  using MS-DOS disc drivers (real mode or 16-bit drivers). If this is the case,
  you may not be able to read certain files on the CD-ROM as some programs only
  work correctly with protected-mode drivers. To obtain protected-mode drivers
  for CD or DVD drives, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q151634 Protected-Mode CD-ROM Drive Support in Windows

4. Click OK, and then close Control Panel.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Enable/Disable UDF Support
--------------------------

If you are using Windows 98 or Windows Me, change the UDF setting. To do this,
follow these steps:

1. Click Start, click Run, type "msconfig" (without the quotation marks) in the
  Open box, and then click OK.

2. Click Advanced.

3. Click the "Disable UDF File System" option, and then click OK.

4. When you are prompted to restart your computer, click OK, and then click Yes.

When your computer restarts, UDF support has changed. If this makes no
difference, change the setting back.

NOTE: Generally, UDF should be enabled. However, some drives do not support UDF.
For these drives, UDF should be left disabled. These drives will not be able to
be read discs that only use the UDF file system.

NOTE: DVD-ROMs require the UDF file system, unless they are a UDF Bridge disc
(mastered for both ISO 9660 and UDF).


Disable DMA for the Drive
-------------------------

To disable DMA for the CD-ROM or DVD drive, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. On the Device Manager tab, click View Devices By Type.

4. Click the plus sign (+) next to CDROM to expand the branch.

5. Click the CD-ROM or DVD drive that you want to change, and then click
  Properties.

6. Click the Settings tab.

7. Click to clear the DMA check box, and then click Close.

8. Close Control Panel, and then restart the computer.


If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Reduce Drive Caching
--------------------

To reduce CD-ROM or DVD drive caching, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. On the Performance tab, click File System.

4. On the CD-ROM or DVD tab, move the Supplemental Cache Size slider to the
  Small position.

5. In the Optimize Access Pattern For box, click NoRead-Ahead.

6. Click OK, and then click Close.

7. When you are prompted to restart your computer, click Yes.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Disable Auto-Insert Notification
--------------------------------

NOTE: If you disable Auto-Insert Notification, your programs can no longer start
automatically.

To disable Auto-Insert Notification:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. In Control Panel, double-click System.

3. On the Device Manager tab, click the PLUS SIGN (+) next to CDROM to expand
  the branch.

4. Click your CD-ROM or DVD drive, and then click Properties.

5. On the Settings tab, click to clear the Auto Insert Notification check box.

6. Click OK, and then click OK again.

7. Close Control Panel, and then restart the computer.

Remove Duplicate Drives
-----------------------

  Restart your computer, press and hold down the CTRL key when your computer
  completes the Power On Self Test (POST), and then select Safe Mode on the
  Startup menu.

8. When Windows starts in Safe mode, click OK.

9. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

10. Double-click System.

11. On the Device Manager tab, click View Devices By Type.

12. Double-click the CDROM branch to expand it.

13. Verify that there are no changes in the list of devices in the branch. If
  you see a device that is not in the list of devices you noted in step 5,
  click the new device, and then click Remove. Repeat this step for each
  device in the branch that is not in the list of devices you noted in step
  5.

  NOTE: If you see new copies of a device that is in the list of devices you
  noted in step 5, check the properties of each copy of the device. If the
  properties for the device match the properties you recorded, keep the
  device. If the properties for the device do not match the properties you
  recorded, remove the device.

14. Click OK.

15. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click OK.
