SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to add and remove page numbers in Microsoft Word 97.

MORE INFORMATION
================

How to Add Page Numbers
-----------------------

Word provides the following two methods to add page numbers to a document or
template. With either method, the page numbers appear in the header or footer at
the top or bottom of the page. Based on the method you choose, Word formats page
numbers in one of two ways: as a field inside a text box or as a field not
placed inside a text box.

Use the Page Numbers Command on the Insert Menu:

Choose this method if you want to add just page numbers to headers or footers.
When you use this method, Word places the page number field inside a text box.

Use the Header and Footer Command on the View Menu:

Choose this method if you want to add a variety of information to headers or
footers -- for example, chapter titles, dates, or page numbers. When you use
this method, Word places the page number field in the header or footer area, but
does not place it inside a text box. This method allows you to have more
formatting control over the header or footer's contents.

How to Remove Page Numbers
--------------------------

How you remove the page number depends on which method was used to insert the
page number. If the page number field is inside a text box, you have to remove
the text box. Removing the text box also removes the page number. If the page
number is not inside a text box, select it and then delete it.

If the Page Number Field Is Inside a Text Box:

To remove the page number field when it is inside a text box, remove the text
box. To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the View menu, click Header and Footer.

  Word displays the header area. If the page number is in the footer area, click
  the Switch Between Header and Footer button on the Header and Footer toolbar.

2. Click the page number that appears in the document's header or footer.

  A hashed border appears around the page number. The contents of the text box
  has focus, and you can insert or delete text inside the text box.

3. Point to the hashed border. When you see a four-headed arrow, click the
  hashed border to select the text box.

4. Press DELETE on your keyboard.

If your document contains multiple sections whose headers and footers are not
linked (for example, page number restarts at 1 in each section), click the Show
Previous button or Show Next button on the Header and Footer toolbar to go to
the adjacent section. Then repeat steps 2-4 for each section.

If the Page Number Field Is Not Inside a Text Box:

To remove the page number field, follow these steps:

1. On the View menu, click Headers and Footers.

  Word displays the header area. If the page number is in the footer area, click
  the Switch Between Header and Footer button on the Header and Footer toolbar.

2. Select the field and then press DELETE.

  NOTE: If you want to delete everything from the header or footer, you can also
  press CTRL+A to select all text and then press DELETE. Choosing this method
  does not select text boxes.

If your document contains multiple sections whose headers and footers are not
linked (for example, page number restarts at 1 in each section), click the Show
Previous button or Show Next button on the Header and Footer toolbar to go to
the adjacent section. Then repeat step 2 for each section.
