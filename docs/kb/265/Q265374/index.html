  through a Range object of a Cell object, none of the changes is applied to

  Cells in Word Table

  When you use the Selection.Information(wdStartOfRangeColumnNumber) or
  Selection.Information(wdStartOfRangeRowNumber) method to return the column or

  not take into account that a table contains merged cells. Thus the returned

  cells.

  Q241628 WD97: Using Selection.Cells in a Loop Gives Incorrect Results

  Programmatically setting or referencing Selection.Cells properties for cells
  in a Word table gives incorrect results when executed within a loop. For
  example, the foreground pattern color changes for only three out of four
  selected cells.

  Q241921 WD97: Copied Text Viewed as Metafile Appears Clipped in Viewer

  When a section of text is formatted with a specific style in Word 97 and then
  copied, using either CTRL+C keys or the Copy command (Edit menu), and then
  viewed as an enhanced metafile through the Clipboard Viewer, the text is
  displayed with the style defined in Normal.dot. This can result in clipping
  of the copied and pasted section due to the font conversion.

  Q243684 WD97:Deleting Paragraph Mark at End of Table Causes Exception Access
  Violation

  When you delete a blank paragraph mark at the end of a Word table along with
  the final row marker on the table, Word 97 may enter into a CPU spin, or an
  Exception Access Violation may occur.

  Q244205 WD97: FileName Field Code Does Not Resolve Mapped NetWare Server Path
  Correctly

  When there are multiple drives mapped to the same NetWare server, Word may
  not resolve the path correctly when you use the FILENAME /p field. Instead of
  the correct drive, Word may display the path relative to another mapped drive
  to the NetWare server.

  Q244434 WD97: Table Is Corrupted After Saving in Word 6.0/95 Format

  Saving a document in Word 6.0/95 format results in a corrupted document if
  the document contains a table, and a floating picture is anchored in a table
  row. If you reopen the document in Word 97 and switch to normal view, Word
  may stop responding (hang), or an access violation may occur. Documents
  opened in Word 95 or Word 6.0 contain duplicate copies of the floating
  picture.

  Q244437 WD97: Splitting Rightmost Cell in Table Loses Some Format

  If any cell in the rightmost column of a Word table has a style applied and
  you split the cell, the resulting leftmost cell does not have all of the
  applied style's formatting, yet the rightmost cell shows the style as
  applied.

  Q244516 WD97: Word Stops When Using VBA to Check List Formatting Properties

  Word stops responding (hangs) and CPU utilization goes to 100 percent when
  you use Visual Basic for Applications to determine properties of list
  formatting in a selection.

  Q247233 WD97: Invalid Page Fault When You Press ENTER in Table or Label Row
  at Top of Screen

  When you press ENTER in the leftmost cell of a table or label row that
  appears at the top of the screen, you may receive an invalid page fault in
  WINWORD.exe.

  Q256904 WD97: Day Name Is Incorrect in a Date and Time Field

  In Word 97 for Windows, when you save a document as type Word 6.0/95 (*.doc)
  or Rich Text Format (*.rtf), the name of the day for a date after February
  29, 2000, is incorrect.

  Q265623 WD97: Embedded Document's Custom and Built-in Properties Lost If VBA
  Module Present

  Custom and built-in properties of a Word document can be lost when a Visual
  Basic for Applications (VBA) module is present and you either embed a Word
  document object that contains a VBA module within an Excel or Word document,
  or you add a VBA module to a Word document that is embedded within Excel or
  Word.

  Q269566 WD97: Error Message When You Click Exit, AutoCorrect, or Increase
  Indent

  When you click AutoCorrect on the Tools menu, Exit on the File menu, Increase
  Indent on the Formatting toolbar, or Bullets or Numbering on the Standard
