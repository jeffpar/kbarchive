SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to copy files from one share to another while
preserving the original NTFS file system file permissions and replacing the
share permissions on the destination share with the permissions of the source
share.

MORE INFORMATION
================

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry.
Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you
understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information
about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following
article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

You can move files from one share to another and retain the original NTFS file
permissions by using the Scopy.exe utility, which is included in the Windows NT
Server 4.0 Resource Kit.

To transfer share permissions from a share on one server to a share of the same
name on a different server, you must save the Shares registry key on the source
server, and then restore this key on the destination server. Transferring share
permissions from one server to another replaces the existing share permissions,
which will be lost.

1. To copy files from one share to another, preserving the original NTFS file
  permissions, run the SCOPY command at the command line with the following
  syntax:

  " SCOPY source_path destination_path /O /A /S" (without the quotation marks)

  where the /O option is used to copy owner security information, the /A option
  is used to copy auditing information, and the /S option is used to copy all
  files in subdirectories.

2. Save the Shares registry key on the source server to a floppy disk:

  a. Start Registry Editor on the source server.

  b. Locate the following registry key:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\ControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Shares\sharename

  c. On the Registry menu, click Save Key.

  d. Save the key to a floppy disk.

  e. Quit Registry Editor.

3. On the destination server, back up the Shares registry key, and then restore
  the saved registry key from the source server to the destination server:

  NOTE: Performing this procedure replaces the existing permissions on the
  destination share.

  a. Start Registry Editor on the destination server.

  b. Locate the following registry key:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\ControlSet\Services\LanmanServer\Shares\sharename

  c. To back up this registry key, on the Registry menu, click Save Key. In the
     Save Key dialog box, specify where you want to back up the key, and then
     click Save. Backing up the registry key allows you to restore the original
     share permissions if you choose to do so later.

  d. To replace the share permissions on the destination share with those from
     the source share, restore the key you previously saved to the floppy disk.
     On the destination server, on the Registry menu, click Restore. Select the
     saved key, and then click Open.

  e. Quit Registry Editor, and then restart the destination server.
