SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to browse to an Active Server Page (ASP) database results page
created in Microsoft FrontPage, you may receive an error message similar to one
of the following:

Error #1:

  Microsoft VBScript runtime error '800a01ad'
  ActiveX component can't create object
  /_fpclass/fpdbrgn1.inc, line 99

NOTE: This error message may be followed by a description of why the resource was
inaccessible.

Error #2:

  Execute Access Denied
  This Virtual Directory does not allow objects to be executed.

Error #3:

  Database Results Error
  The database connection named 'Sample' is undefined.

  This problem can occur if:

  * the connection has been removed from the web.
  * the file 'global.asa' is missing or contains errors.
  * the root folder does not have Scripting permissions enabled.
  * the web is not marked as an Application Root.

This behavior can occur if the following respective conditions are true:

Error #1:

The NTFS permissions are defined incorrectly for the "%ProgramFiles%\Common
Files\System" folder.

Error #2:

The virtual directory that you are connecting to is not marked as an ASP
application.

Error #3:

permissions defined in the Microsoft Internet Information Service (IIS)
settings.

RESOLUTION

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are trying to gain access to a Microsoft Access database, make sure that
you have established the appropriate permissions. For additional information,
click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q187506 List of NTFS Permissions Required for IIS Site to Work

When a user attempts to perform an Internet Database Connector (IDC) or ActiveX
Data Objects (ADO) query, the query is run in context of the authenticated Web
user. Typically, you (the FrontPage Web developer) might grant the directory
permissions listed later in this article to an anonymous user or to the
authenticated Microsoft Windows NT user account. (By default, the anonymous user
is IUSR_&lt;machine-name&gt;.)

When you apply these permissions, apply them to all existing files unless
otherwise noted.

When you set permissions for the IUSR account, you need to add all user accounts
that need to be authenticated on the Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS)
computer.

The directories identified in the sixth and seventh bullets that follow are
located by default in the Program Files/Common Files/System directory and are
needed only for ASP and ADO queries.

Typical permissions for IUSR are as follows:

- Read permission to the root directory of the drive on which ASP is installed.
- Write permission to the Windows NT directory in Windows NT, or to the WinNT
  directory in Windows 2000.
- Read permission to the System32 directory.
- Read permission to the Inetsrv directory.
- Read permission to the InetPub (or content directory).
- Read permission to the OLE DB directory.
- Read permission to the ADO directory.
- Change permissions to the database file and directories.

NOTE: The Microsoft Jet database engine uses the System Temp and Tmp environment
variables to specify the location of temporary files that are created during Jet
operations. By default, these environment variables are defined for users and
are not system-wide settings. For additional information, click the article
