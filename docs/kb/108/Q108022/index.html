SUMMARY
=======

When the NAV1 navigation radio is set to a VOR frequency and the autopilot is
set to follow the heading from NAV1, the aircraft may appear to be flying toward
the wrong station.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The signal transmitted by a VOR is line-of-sight, which means that it can be
blocked by high terrain. VORs also have a limited range. Because of this,
several stations may, in the real world, be assigned the same frequency. For
example, Oakland and Seattle both operate on 116.8kHz. For example, if you are
in Red Bluff, CA, (north of Oakland) and set your NAV1 to 116.8kHz, your
autopilot may take you south to Oakland when you may have wanted to go north to
Seattle.

To use the autopilot to fly to a station that is farther away than another
station on the same VOR frequency, do the following:

1. From the NavCom menu, click Set Autopilot.

2. Turn on the autopilot master switch.

3. Turn on Heading Lock. You may also want to use the Wing Leveler and Altitude
  Lock, but these are not necessary for navigation purposes. For more
  information about using the autopilot, see page 14 in the Microsoft Flight
  Simulator User's Guide.

4. Enter a heading to your desired station.

5. Click OK.

6. Take off and engage the autopilot by pressing COMMAND-T. The aircraft should
  assume the altitude and headings you have assigned.

7. Fly on the assigned heading until you are closer to your destination station
  than you are to the other station on the same frequency.

8. From the NavCom menu, click Set Autopilot.

9. Click NAV 1 Lock.

10. Click OK.
