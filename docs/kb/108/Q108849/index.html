-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
- Microsoft Windows 95 
- Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The AnyKey keyboard on your Gateway 2000 computer performs incorrectly or
doesn't respond.

CAUSE
=====

If you accidentally or incorrectly reprogram a key or key combination on this
keyboard, certain keys may perform incorrectly or may not respond at all. This
may cause you to assume there is a problem with either MS-DOS or Microsoft
Windows.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you program your AnyKey keyboard incorrectly, you must reprogram the key(s)
involved or reset the keyboard to restore normal functionality. You cannot
restore keyboard functionality by restarting your computer or by unplugging the
keyboard or computer.

To determine whether you have the AnyKey model of the Gateway 2000 keyboard, look
at the diagram on page 3-12 of your "Gateway 2000 Computer System User's Guide."
The AnyKey keyboard has a red Program indicator light in the upper right corner,
above the numeric keypad. The AnyKey keyboard also has two complete sets of
function keys, one across the top and one on the left side of the keyboard.

Reprogramming a Key on the AnyKey Keyboard
------------------------------------------

Use the following instructions to reprogram a key on the AnyKey keyboard:

1. Press the REMAP key.

2. Press the key (or key combination) you want to reprogram.

  For example, to remap the F9 key, press F9.

3. Press the key (or key combination) you want to map to the key you pressed in
  step 2 above. If you want to remap the key to itself, press the key you
  pressed in step 2 again (that is, to reset a key, press REMAP, then press the
  key you want to reset twice.

  For example, to restore the original functionality of the F9 key, press F9
  again.

Resetting the Entire AnyKey Keyboard
------------------------------------

When your keyboard is malfunctioning due to incorrect AnyKey programming, you may
be unable to determine which keys to reset, especially if more than one key or a
key combination has been reprogrammed. In this case, you may need to reset the
entire keyboard.

To reset the entire AnyKey keyboard to the default settings, press
CTRL+ALT+SUSPEND MACRO. The Program indicator light on the keyboard flashes for
a few seconds. When the Program light stops flashing, the process is complete.

NOTE: This procedure only works if the CTRL or ALT keys have not been
reprogrammed. If the Program indicator light does not flash when you press
CTRL+ALT+SUSPEND MACRO, you must reset the CTRL and ALT keys individually, using
the procedure in the preceding section (for example, to reset the CTRL key,
press REMAP, CTRL, CTRL). After you reset the CTRL and ALT keys, you can reset
the entire keyboard.
