-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, persistent failures of directory
synchronization (Dir-Sync) may be recorded in the DIRSYNC.LOG file:

  Fatal [203] GAL Rebuild problem accessing files Global Address List not
  installed on this Postoffice

CAUSE
=====

The GAL.NME file is being held open (but not locked) by the MSSFS.DLL file. The
problem only occurs with MSSFS.DLL version 3.2.0.4046 through 3.2.0.4074.

MSSFS.DLL is used to resolve the names of intended recipients. When an intended
recipient is an external user with a name already in the Personal Address Book
(PAB), the GAL.NME file is not closed after the message is sent. The server does
not allow REBUILD.EXE to delete the old GAL.NME, thus generating the error.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are currently two workarounds:

- From the Mail menu, choose Options and uncheck Add Recipients To Personal
  Address Book.

- Make sure every workstation performs an Exit And Sign Out from Mail for
  Windows before you run REBUILD.EXE.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
for Windows. This problem was corrected in version 3.2a (which includes
MSSFS.DLL version 3.2.0.4074).

For information on obtaining this update, query on the following word in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
