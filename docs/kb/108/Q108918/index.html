The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you save a file to a network drive in Word Document format, the following
error message may occur in Word for Windows:

  Word cannot save or create this file. Make sure the disk is not full or write
  protected. &lt;path&gt;&lt;filename&gt;

  -or-

  Word cannot save or create this file. The disk may be full or
  write-protected. Try one or more of the following:
  *Free more memory.
  *Make sure that the disk you want to save the file on is not full,
  write-protected, or damaged.

NOTE: Sometimes you can save the file the first time to a network drive, but the
error occurs when you try to save the file a second time.

Similarly, when you open a Word for Windows document from a network drive, the
following error message may occur:

  Cannot open document.

These errors do not occur if you save the file to your local hard disk or floppy
disk drive. Similarly, the error does not occur if you save the file to a
network drive in a file format other than Word Document format, such as Word For
Windows 2.0 format or RTF (Rich Text Format).

These errors occur when you use Windows 95 if you use a real-mode network
protocol instead of the normal Windows 95 network drivers.

CAUSE
=====

You cannot save Word documents on a network drive if your network operating
system file-sharing and file-locking capabilities are not turned on or are set
too low.


You can save in other file formats on a network drive because the file converters
do not use the Storage.dll file, which requires file-locking capabilities.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid these error messages, have your network administrator turn on or
increase the range-locking settings for your network.

For more information about the file-sharing and file-locking capabilities of your
network, refer to your network documentation.

To temporarily work around this "Cannot save or create file" problem, do one of
the following:

- Save your document to a local hard disk or floppy disk. -or-

- Save the document on the network drive in a different file format, such as
  Word For Windows 2.0.

- Save the file to the local hard drive and move it to the network drive. You
  will also need to have your network administrator remove this file if nobody
  is using it.
