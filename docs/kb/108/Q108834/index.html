The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Messaging Application Program Interface (MAPI) from versions 3.0 and 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, you can add a custom command or message (Message
of the Day). The Mail administrator can use this, for example, to manually or
automatically send messages to all or some of the mail users.

You can invoke an automatic message by choosing it from a menu, having it run
when Mail starts up or closes, or having it run when mail is received.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Automatic messages are built with Microsoft Visual Basic for Windows, Microsoft
C, or any other compatible language. Documentation on this is available in the
"Technical Reference" manual, primarily in chapters 1 and 2. The manual also
describes how to implement the automatic or custom message as a menu selection,
or as something activated by a Mail event (such as when Mail starts or ends, or
when new mail arrives).

The Mail administrator can also have the executable run continuously and check
the time of day and day of year of a triggering event. When the time criteria
(which can be kept in an INI file) are met, the application displays the
designated Message of the Day or Custom Message. This saves the Mail
administrator from having to intervene in the operation.

Custom commands appear as built-in Mail features after they are added to a
Microsoft Mail menu by adding data to the MSMAIL.INI file. They can be installed
on an individual computer for use by a single Mail user or on a network file
server to be shared by many Mail users.

Custom commands can be used to send a piece of mail around to the desired
recipients; automatic Mail executables can display a text file located on the
file server pointed to by a filename in the "command line" section of the
SHARED.INI. In this case, use the &lt;ExtsDir&gt; variable to specify the
location of the message if it is stored in the same location as the custom
command, and modify each user's MSMAIL.INI file to look for the SHARED.INI.

You can also use the Electronic Forms Designer to create automatic messages.
Since the Electronic Forms Designer uses Visual Basic as its design interface,
forms you create with it can include the code needed to process message
delivery. A custom form created using the E-Forms designer provides a custom
interface for a "Message of the Day" feature. For more information on the
Electronic Forms Designer, contact Microsoft Inside Sales at (800) 227-4679.

both Microsoft C and Visual Basic. You can download MAPIUPD.EXE, a
