-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you run Beame and Whiteside's network file system (BW-NFS) for Lan Workplace
on open datalink interface (ODI) with Windows for Workgroups 3.11 and you set an
NFS file system as a mounted drive, the drive is visible but not accessible in
Windows. (It appears as a blank disk.)

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is caused by a problem with the Beame and Whiteside NFS
redirector.

RESOLUTION
==========

Although the directory appears empty, the files can be accessed if you know the
name of the file. Beame and Whiteside is aware of this problem.

STATUS
======

Beame and Whiteside has developed new drivers to make Windows for Workgroups
3.11 work with its product and the ODI stack. The problem in the redirector will
be addressed in a future release. For more information, contact Beame and
Whiteside at (905) 765-0822 (phone)or (905) 765-0815 (fax).
