-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When upgrading from Exchange 5.0 to Exchange 5.5, the Key Management server
(KMS) database is converted. During the KMS conversion phase of the Exchange 5.5
upgrade, the upgrade process may report the following error message:

  An unexpected, unknown error has occurred.

  MAPI or an unspecified service provider.
  ID no: 00000000-0000-00000000

After the error message appears, the only option is to click OK. After you click
OK, the upgrade is terminated.

CAUSE
=====

When the database is converted, all user certificates are moved to the new
database. Next, the original database is scanned for revoked certificates and a
transaction is built to mark these certificates as revoked in the new database.
If there are more revoked certificates than will fit in a single database
transaction, the above error message will appear.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Component: KMS

  File Name      Version
  -------------------------
  Kmsupgrd.dll   5.5.2418.0

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 2.


MORE INFORMATION
================

To apply this fix, copy the contents of the Exchange Server 5.5 CD to disk.
Next, replace the file Server\Setup\&lt;platform&gt;\Bin\KMSUpgrd.dll. Finally,
run the Setup from the updated disk tree.
