-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

It is important to plan your domain carefully. You cannot change a computer's
role from member server to domain controller without reinstalling Windows NT
Server.

What Is the Difference Between a Domain Controller (DC) and a Server?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

A member server:

- Does not get a copy of the domain account database, but does have access to
  it if it is a member of the domain.

- Maintains its own local user account database.

- Does not process domain logons.

- Has the same built-in user groups as a Windows NT Workstation (including
  Power Users).

- Can be configured as a member of a domain or workgroup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is sometimes necessary to make a determination on the role of a server in the
domain. Use one of these methods to determine the computer's role.

Method 1
--------

1. Click Start and then click Programs.

2. Click Command Prompt.

3. At the command prompt, type "net accounts" (without quotation marks). Press
  ENTER.

You will see a list of information and the last line of information will say
computer role.

Sample of the output:

  c:\&gt;NET ACCOUNTS
  Force user logoff how long after time expires?:       Never
  Minimum password age (days):                          0
  Maximum password age (days):                          42
  Minimum password length:                              0
  Length of password history maintained:                None
  Lockout threshold:                                    Never
  Lockout duration (minutes):                           30
  Lockout observation window (minutes):                 30
  Computer role:                                        PRIMARY
  The command completed successfully.

Method 2
--------

1. Right-click Network Neighborhood.

2. Click Properties.

3. Click the Identification tab

4. Click Change.

If you have the ability to change the computer to a workgroup, the server is a
member server; this will not be an option if the server is a domain controller.

Method 3
--------

1. Click Start, click Programs, and then select Administrative Tools.

2. Click Server Manager.

3. Check the role of the computer in Server Manager.
