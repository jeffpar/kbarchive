The information in this article applies to:

- LinkAge Message Exchange, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Messages may stop flowing from Exchange to a PROFS system through the OV/VM
LinkAge 3.2 connector. A zero-byte message or a print spool file, sent from the
PROFS system, may cause the VM2DIA process to stop. This, in turn, causes the
connector to stop processing all inbound messages until the user manually
removes the problem message from the queue.

One or more of the following event errors may be logged in the Exchange event
viewer log:

- Event ID 23853

- Event ID 23923 (Peeking the NJE data record has failed.)

- Event ID 40507, 40517, and 40512 (The RSCS fails in vm2dia.c.)

- Event ID 40003 (Transform terminated.)

- Event ID 23179 (SYSOUT_INBOUND has failed.)

- Event ID 23106

- Event ID 40501

- Event ID 4065 (Critical error when attempting to process an inbound item.)

- Event ID 62302

The following errors will be recorded in the LinkAge browser log:

- LME-PROFS-VMDIA(0124) 4 23713:DATA SET HEADER record received &gt;&gt;
  rscsclnt(802)

- LME-PROFS-VMDIA(0124) 4 23919:No more data set header received &gt;&gt;
  rscsclnt(769)

- LME-PROFS-VMDIA(0124) 1 23853:Buffer of size 80 is too small for an NJE
  record; it must be at least 132 bytes in size &gt;&gt; njeclnt(806)

- LME-PROFS-VMDIA(0124) 1 23923:Error occurred when peeking on an NJE data
  record from the NJE server &gt;&gt; rscsclnt(955)

- LME-PROFS-DIAVM(01d5) 1 23929:Error occurred while deallocating a session

  abnormally &gt;&gt; rscsclnt(629)

- LME-PROFS-DIAVM(01d5) 1 40508:RSCS client failed to deallocate a session for
  the outbound distribution &gt;&gt; dia2vm(5406)

CAUSE
=====

A message in the PROFS environment, located in the Exchange-bound queue and
listed with a 0-byte length, does not match the expected record length in bytes
in the linked list element. The program then pads the difference, and the buffer
size is too small, generating a 23853 and then fails peeking the NJE data record
with a 23923. The RSCS fails parsing the OV/VM distribution and log. After the
failure, the system attempts an outbound session and generates a 40501, causing
the subsystem load to fail and generating a critical error 4065. The Directory
Exchange Manager (DXM) mainline processing function fails, being unable to
return an error code to the PROFS system, which leaves the bad message in the
queue.


Note that this problem also occurs when a print spool file is sent from the OV
environment in an MVS system through a JES3 (Job Entry System3) connection to
the VM system and then routed to the PROFS connector.
