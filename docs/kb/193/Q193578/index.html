The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a file is rolled back, previous "File Label" label comments are corrupted.
The first eight characters of the label comment are removed. If you run Analyze
in autofix mode (-f switch), it removes the entire corrupted label comment.

A "File Label" is a label that is applied to an individual file, not a project. A
project label is applied to an entire project and all its sub- projects. This
error does not occur with project labels.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can work around this problem by performing the steps in the following
article instead of doing a rollback. The major benefit of this method is that it
maintains all the history information.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q153493 HOWTO: Perform a RollBack Without Losing History

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new file and add it to the project with a comment of "original
  comment".

2. Check it out and make a change.

3. Check it in with the comment "first comment".

4. Label it with the label "first label" and the comment "first label comment".

5. Check it out and make a change.

6. Check it in with the comment "second comment".

7. Label it with the label "second label" and the comment "second label
  comment".

8. Check it out and make a change.

9. Check it in with the comment "third comment".

10. Label it with the label "third label" and the comment "third label comment".

11. Show history of the file. There should be five versions, with labels on
  versions one, three, and five. Examine each of the Details to make sure that
  all of the labels and comments are in tact.

12. Click on version three.

13. Click Rollback, and perform the rollback.

RESULT: Examine each of the Details.

NOTE: The first eight characters are missing from the label comment on version
three.
