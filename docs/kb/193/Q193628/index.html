-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error occurs when you use the APPEND FROM command with certain
file types:

  Fatal error: Exception code=C0000005

After you click OK, Visual FoxPro exits.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs when you use the following APPEND FROM syntax to append from the
following file types:

  APPEND FROM &lt;filename&gt;.xls TYPE XLS &amp;&amp; Excel 2.1, 3.0 and 4.0 file types
  APPEND FROM &lt;filename&gt;.wk1 TYPE WK1 &amp;&amp; Lotus 1-2-3 version 2.x
  APPEND FROM &lt;filename&gt;.wk3 TYPE WK3 &amp;&amp; Lotus 1-2-3 version 3.x
  APPEND FROM &lt;filename&gt;.mod TYPE MOD &amp;&amp; Microsoft Multiplan 4.01
  APPEND FROM &lt;filename&gt;.wks TYPE WKS &amp;&amp; Lotus 1-2-3 version 1-A

Appending from other file types can also cause the crash although text files and
.dbf files do not seem to have any problems.

NOTE: Using the COPY TO command in Visual FoxPro to copy a table out to one of
the file types in the preceding list and then appending back into the table from
that file does not appear to cause the crash.

RESOLUTION
==========

The IMPORT command can import the file types in the preceding list into a new
table. With a little work, you can append this imported table into an existing
table. You can use the following sample code instead of the program in the
"Steps to Reproduce Behavior" section in order to append the records
successfully.

Sample Code
-----------

  CLOSE DATABASE ALL
  CLEAR ALL
  CLEAR

  SET SAFETY OFF
  CREATE TABLE fruit ;
      (fruit c(12), color c(15), treeorvine c(10), number n(8,2))

  INSERT INTO fruit VALUES ("Apple", "Red", "Tree", 5)
  INSERT INTO fruit VALUES ("Orange", "Orange","Tree", 18)
  INSERT INTO fruit VALUES ("Grape", "Purple", "Vine", 42)
  INSERT INTO fruit VALUES ("Blueberry", "Blue", "Bush", 78)
  INSERT INTO fruit VALUES ("Grapefruit", "Pink", "Tree", 62)
  INSERT INTO fruit VALUES ("Banana", "Yellow", "Tree", 37)
  SELECT fruit

  WAIT WINDOW "Choose an Excel 2.1, 3 or 4 file"
  x=GETFILE("xls")
  SELECT 0
  IMPORT FROM (x) TYPE XLS
  SET SAFETY ON
  SET DELETED ON
  DELETE FOR RECNO()=1 &amp;&amp; To eliminate field name headers in Excel sheet.
  y=ALIAS()

  * Need to change the field names to match the target table.
  For i=1 TO FCOUNT()
    ALTER TABLE (y) RENAME COLUMN (LOWER(FIELD(i))) TO (FIELD(i,"fruit"))
  ENDFOR

  SELECT fruit
  APPEND FROM (y)
  SELECT (y)
  USE
  ERASE (y)
  SELECT fruit

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3.

For more information about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following
articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q194022 INFO: Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs, What, Where, Why

  Q194295 HOWTO: Tell That Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs Are Installed

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem occurs more frequently when the table used to append the records
into is not empty.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

WARNING: The following steps cause Visual FoxPro to crash. Please make sure that
you save all important data or code before following the steps. It is also a
good idea to save all information in any other running applications before you
use these steps.

1. Create a new Excel sheet with the following layout in Sheet1:

NOTE: Excel 97 was used to recreate these steps at Microsoft.

     Cell          Data to Enter
     ---------------------------
     A1            Fruit
     B1            Color
     C1            TreeorVine
     D1            Number
     A2            Apple
     B2            Red
     C2            Tree
     D2            50.25
     A3            Banana
     B3            Yellow
     C3            Tree
     D3            17.45

2. In Excel, from the File menu, choose Save As. In the Save As Type drop-down
  list box, select Microsoft Excel 4.0 Worksheet (*.xls). Name the file
  fruit4.xls.

3. In Visual FoxPro 6.0, place the following code in a new program file, save it
  and then run the program:

  CLOSE DATABASE ALL
  CLEAR ALL
  CLEAR

  SET SAFETY OFF
  CREATE TABLE fruit ;
     (fruit c(12), color c(15), treeorvine c(10), number n(8,2))
  SET SAFETY ON
  SELECT fruit
  INSERT INTO fruit VALUES ("Apple", "Red", "Tree", 5)
  INSERT INTO fruit VALUES ("Orange", "Orange","Tree", 18)
  INSERT INTO fruit VALUES ("Grape", "Purple", "Vine", 42)
  INSERT INTO fruit VALUES ("Blueberry", "Blue", "Bush", 78)
  INSERT INTO fruit VALUES ("Grapefruit", "Pink", "Tree", 62)
  INSERT INTO fruit VALUES ("Banana", "Yellow", "Tree", 37)

  APPEND FROM fruit4.xls TYPE XLS    &amp;&amp; This causes the crash.
