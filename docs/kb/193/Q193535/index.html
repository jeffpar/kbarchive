-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The article explains the changes to the mapping rule file, which affects mapping
of directory synchronization (dirsync) information from Lotus Notes person
documents to Exchange Server custom recipients. The Notes person document file
in C:\Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn\Dxamex\Mapnotes.tbl may not be effective
depending on the rule and the source person documents.

CAUSE
=====

UPPER, LOWER, and PROPER
------------------------

These mapping rules change only the case of the source attribute or expression.
For example, UPPER("User") resolves to "USER."

When the changes to the mapping rules only result in changing the case of a
target attribute for a particular directory entry, the Directory Exchange Agent
for Microsoft Exchange (DXAMEX) will not update the Exchange Server custom
recipient.

For example, before changing the mapping rule, the Notes attribute, FirstName, is
mapped straight through to Exchange Server's FirstName attribute, with the
mapping rule FirstName = FirstName in the
C:\Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn\Dxamex\Mapnotes.tbl mapping table.

Changing the mapping rule to read FirstName = UPPER(FirstName) should result in
all propagated users from Notes to Exchange Server to appear with an uppercase
FirstName attribute.

This mapping rule will not take effect, even when an Immediate Full Load is
launched, until a mapping rule is changed that affects the contents of the
target attribute other than a simple case change.

Propagating a Value in a Field that Previously Was Empty
--------------------------------------------------------

For example, changing the mapping rule:

  Company = Company

After a user has been propagated from Notes to Exchange Server, and a single
change is made to populate a previously empty Company field in Notes, DXAMEX
will not update the Exchange Server custom recipient.

This mapping rule will not take effect, even when an Immediate Full Load is
launched, until a mapping rule is changed that affects the contents of a target
attribute that is already populated on the Exchange Server side for the custom
recipient.

Appending a Value to an Existing Field
--------------------------------------

For example, changing the mapping rule:

  Company = Company

to the rule:

  Company = Company " USA"

This mapping rule will not take effect, even when an Immediate Full Load is
launched, until a mapping rule (or contents of the source attribute) is changed
that causes the target attribute not to match the mapped source attribute up to
the number of characters contained in the target attribute.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
