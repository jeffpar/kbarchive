-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.0 SP1, 5.0 SP2, 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message with the Euro currency symbol (a "C" with two horizontal
lines through the center) on the To, Cc, or Subject line, the symbol may be
displayed as a question mark (?) when you open the message in an e-mail client,
or when you view the message in the preview pane. This problem also occurs when
you view the Subject line in the Inbox, on the taskbar, or on the title bar of
the message window. However, Euro currency symbols in the body of the message
are displayed properly.

Note that this problem only occurs when the following conditions are met:

- The message's character set is Western European (ISO-8859-1).

- The message is sent using Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) and received
  using Internet Mail Access Protocol (IMAP) or POP3.

In addition, note that this problem is not dependent on the e-mail client or
operating system you are using. The problem can occur even if your e-mail
client, the operating system on which the e-mail client is running, and the
Microsoft Exchange Server computer all support the euro currency symbol.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the Western European character set does not support
the Euro currency symbol. Therefore, the Euro currency symbol is not converted
properly when the information store converts the message from Multipurpose
Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) format so that it can be viewed in a Messaging
Application Programming Interface (MAPI) or POP3 e-mail client.

RESOLUTION
==========

Exchange Server 5.0
-------------------

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 service pack that contains
this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Information Store

+--------------------------+
| File name  | Version     | 
+--------------------------+
| Mdbmsg.dll | 5.0.1461.85 | 
+--------------------------+
| Store.exe  | 5.0.1461.85 | 
+--------------------------+

After you apply the fix, if you are sending a message from a POP3 e-mail client
to a MAPI e-mail client, you must select the Allow 8-Bit Characters In Headers
check box in the POP3 e-mail client. If you are sending a message from a POP3
e-mail client to another POP3 e-mail client, you do not need to select this
check box, but the euro currency symbol is still displayed correctly if you do.



Exchange Server 5.5
-------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Information Store

+-------------------------+
| File name  | Version    | 
+-------------------------+
| Gapi32.dll | 5.5.2539.0 | 
+-------------------------+
| Mdbmsg.dll | 5.5.2539.0 | 
+-------------------------+
| Store.exe  | 5.5.2539.0 | 
+-------------------------+


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 5.0 and 5.5. This problem was corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you apply the fix, messages that are labeled with the ISO-8859-1 character
set are labeled with the Windows-1252 character set instead. This allows the
Euro currency symbol to be converted properly by the information store. However,
if your e-mail client, the operating system on which the e-mail client is
running, or the Microsoft Exchange Server computer do not support the Euro
currency symbol, the symbol may still be displayed incorrectly when you view the
To, Cc, or Subject line in an e-mail client.


For information about the availability of the euro currency symbol in Microsoft
Windows NT character sets, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
