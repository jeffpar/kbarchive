The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect Exchange 4.0 or 5.0 sites with a Dynamic RAS Connector and use
custom recipients instead of directory replication, messages that are replied to
are returned with the following non-delivery report (NDR):

  Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

     Subject:   RE: Please Reply
     Sent:   15/04/97 14:27:29

  The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

     'Test User' on 15/04/97 14:27:30
           The recipient name is not recognized
           MSEXCH:MSExchangeMTA:&lt;SITENAME&gt;:&lt;SERVERNAME&gt;

Note that the name is a valid user on the receiving server, the custom recipients
are created from an export file created on the receiving server, and details are
correct.

CAUSE
=====

If you install Exchange Server to a different site or organization and only
modify the display name, an NDR results when you reply to messages that
originated at the site where the Organization/Site display names and
distinguished names match. The reply address contains the return routing
information, which is based on the X.500 Distinguished Name. The address space
is configured with the display name information. The message does not go through
when the sending server tries to resolve the name because it does not have a
route.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

- Add a new address space based on the directory names for the receiving site.

- Reinstall the Exchange Server software that has incorrect directory names
  specified.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To verify the symptoms above, try sending a message by selecting the names from
the global address list. Verify that the Directory Name fields for Organization
and Site are the same as the Display Name fields.
