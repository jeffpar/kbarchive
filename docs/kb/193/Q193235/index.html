VBCECOMM.EXE Readme
-------------------

What's Required?:

1. To allow the MSCEComm control to access the serial ports on the desktop under
  emulation, the DDK needs to be installed during the Handheld PC 2.0 Platform
  SDK installation. To install, run the setup program and use the Custom
  install option. Select Device Driver Development Kit. This will install the
  wceemuld device necessary to make the MSCEComm control work in emulation.
  Restart the computer after the wceemuld device is installed.

2. The mobile device connection must be disabled after launching the project.
  This is required due to the fact that the sample program uses the same serial
  port for communications.

3. Windows 2000 or Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 3 or later must be installed
  on the desktop.

Scenarios:

The VBCEComm.vbp sample was tested with the following scenarios:

1. Serial communication between emulation on the desktop and the remote device
  (connected to the same desktop).

2. Serial communication between emulation and emulation with the two desktops
  connected using a null modem cable.

3. Serial communication between emulation and the desktop running the Visual
  Basic sample serial application (VBTerm.exe). VBTerm.exe is also included in
  the self-extracting VBCEComm.exe file. The two desktops are connected using a
  null modem cable.

Step-By-Step Instructions
-------------------------

Scenario 1 (emulation to remote device):

1. Connect the Handheld PC device to the desktop.

2. Open the VBCEComm.vbp project in Visual Basic.

3. Select VBCEComm Properties from the Project menu and change the Run on Target
  option to Remote Device.

4. Press F5 to run the project. A copy of VBCEComm will be running on the remote
  device.

5. On the desktop computer running emulation, close the emulation window if it
  is open. All applications running in emulation must be stopped and all
  emulation windows and debug windows must be closed in order to start up the
  wceemuld device.

6. Click Start, point to Programs, point to "Microsoft Windows CE Services", and
  then click Mobile Devices. On the File menu, clear the Enable Serial
  Communication check box.

7. In the Control Panel, double-click Devices.

8. Select the Serial device driver, and then click Stop.

9. Select the wceemuld device driver, and then click Start.

10. In the VBCEComm project, select VBCEComm Properties from the Project menu,
  and then change the Run on Target option to Emulator.

11. Press F5 to run the project in emulation.

12. Click COMM Start on both ends. Leave the default settings unchanged, and
  then click OK. If you want to change the settings, make sure the settings on
  both ends match.

13. Type in some text in the Write (Outgoing) Text box, and then click Send Text
  on one end. The text should appear in the Read (Incoming) Text box on the
  other end.

  NOTE: The desktop system may need to be shut down, powered off and then
  turned back on in order for the text to be successfully sent. This will
  require steps 7-9 to be repeated.

Scenario 2 (emulation to emulation):

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to "Microsoft Windows CE Services", and
  then click Mobile Devices. On the File menu, clear the "Enable Serial
  Communication" check box.

2. In the Control Panel, double-click Devices.

3. Select the Serial device driver, and then click Stop.

4. Select the wceemuld device driver, and then click Start.

5. Use a null modem cable to connect the two desktop copmuters.

6. Open VBCEComm.vbp with the toolkit on both desktops.

7. In the VBCEComm project, select VBCEComm Properties from the Project menu,
  and then change the Run on Target option to Emulator.

8. On both desktops, press F5 to run the project in emulation.

9. Click COMM Start on both ends. Leave the default settings unchanged, and then
  click OK. If you want to change the settings, make sure the settings on both
  ends match.

10. Type in some text in the Write (Outgoing) text box, and then click Send Text
  on one end. The text should appear in the Read (Incoming) Text box on the
  other end.

  NOTE: The desktop systems may need to be shut down, powered off and then
  turned back on in order for the text to be successfully sent. This will
  require steps 2-4 to be repeated.

Scenario 3 (emulation to VBTerm application):

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to "Microsoft Windows CE Services", and
  then click Mobile Devices. On the File menu, clear the "Enable Serial
  Communication" check box.

2. In the Control Panel, double-click Devices.

3. Select the Serial device driver, and then click Stop.

4. Select the wceemuld device driver, and then click Start.

5. Use a null modem cable to connect the two desktop computers.

6. Open VBCEComm.vbp with the toolkit on one desktop.

7. In the VBCEComm project, select VBCEComm Properties from the Project menu,
  and then change the Run on Target option to Emulator.

8. Press F5 to run the project in emulation.

9. Run VBTerm.exe on the other desktop.

10. In the VBTerm application, select Open Port from the CommPort menu.

11. In the VBCEComm project, click COMM Start. Leave the default settings
  unchanged, and then click OK.

12. Type in some text in the Write (Outgoing) text box, and then click Send Text
  on one end. The text should appear in the VBTerm application running on the
  other end.

Troubleshooting Tips
--------------------

1. If the following error message appears when running on either emulation or on
  the remote device:

  Unable to Load Startup Form

  Select Control Manager fromthe Windows CE menu in the Visual Basic design
  environment and ensure that the MSCEComm control is registered for use in
  each.

2. The DTREnable property of the MSCEComm control must be set to TRUE.

3. If communication fails, shut down the desktop computer and turn off the
  power. Wait for a few seconds and turn it back on again.

4. If wceemuld device fails to start, check to see if the emulation window is
  closed already. If not, close the emulator, restart the computer and start
  the wceemuld device again after stopping the serial device, which starts up
  automatically by default.

5. If the serial device fails to stop, check to see if the mobile device
  connection is disabled. The machine may need to be rebooted in order to be
  able to stop the serial device again.
