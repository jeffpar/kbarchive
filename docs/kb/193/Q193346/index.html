-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The LSDIAMEX process of the Exchange SNADs Connector may shut down and stop
delivering messages to Exchange. You may see an error message similar to the
following in the Exchange Connectivity Manager's log browser:

  Queue threshold exceeded. Suspending SNA Link. Please Reduce Disk
  Usage.

CAUSE
=====

When a message with an embedded mail object is sent from the host to Exchange
using inbody addressing, the message arrives in the SNADS connector's Gateway
Mail List input queue as two separate mail objects. The SNADS connector
processes the message body (the first mail object in the queue) correctly but
shuts down when processing the embedded attachment. The code tries to close the
file handle of the embedded mail object, which had been previously closed when
it was being added into Exchange as an attachment. Note that the error only
occurs when the embedded mail object is added to Exchange as an attachment.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Mexdia.msg     5.5.2347.0

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 2.
