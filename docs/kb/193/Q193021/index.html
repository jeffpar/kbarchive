The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Pressing an ARROW key when a control contained on a SSTab has the focus may
cause focus to be transferred to a control on a Tab that is not visible. The
behavior also occurs if the control on a Tab that is not visible has an access
key (ex. Command2.Caption = "&amp;Command2"). The control's Click event can be
accessed by pressing the ALT+C key combination, even though the control is on a
tab that is not visible.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this bug behavior, set the focus to the Tab with the control in
the Lost Focus event of the last control in the Tab. If you created the sample
project, add the following code to the Form1 code window:

  Private Sub Command1_LostFocus()
     SSTab1.Tab = 1
     SSTab1.SetFocus
  End Sub

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
  default.

2. Add a reference to the Microsoft Tabbed Dialog Control 5.0/6.0 by clicking
  Components from the Project Menu and checking "Microsoft Tabbed Dialog
  Control 5.0/6.0."

3. Add a Tabbed Dialog Control (SSTab1) to Form1. There will be three tabs:
  Tab0, Tab1, and Tab2.

4. Add a CommandButton to each tab on the SSTab1.

5. On the second tab, Tab 1, add the following code to the Click event of the
  CommandButton on this tab:

        SSTab1.Caption = "changed"

6. Also on the second tab, set the Caption property of the CommandButton to
  "&amp;Caption."

7. Run the project.

8. Click on the first tab, Tab 0, of the SSTab1 and hit the TAB key to move the
  focus to the CommandButton on Tab 0.

9. Now press the RIGHT ARROW key (-&gt;). Notice that no visible control has the
  focus.

10. Press the ENTER key. Notice the Tab 0 caption changes to "changed" showing
  that the middle tab's button was pressed.

11. Stop the project and run it again.

12. Click on the first tab, Tab 0, of the SSTab1 and hit the TAB key to move the
  focus to the CommandButton on Tab 0.

13. Press the ALT+C key combination. Note that the Tab 0 caption changes to
  "changed," showing that the middle tab's button was pressed.

  The Click event of the CommandButton fires in both cases, the ARROW key and
  the ACCESS key, even when the tab is not visible.
