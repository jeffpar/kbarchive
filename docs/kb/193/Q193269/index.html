The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to remotely control a Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows
98 client using Winsock2 and having Internet Protocol (IP) as the default
protocol, Remote Control is unsuccessful. The client may experience a general
protection (GP) fault in Idisp16.dll.


CAUSE
=====

In versions earlier than Winsock 2.0, WUSER (actually Idisp16.dll) is able to
call Winsock from the 16-bit display driver code and the packets are sent
without executing any 32-bit code. In Winsock 2.0, the work is done in 32-bit
code. If the display driver wants to send a packet, its Winsock call is called
through a thunk to the 32-bit code. Calling through the thunk releases the
"Win16 Mutex," which enables multiple threads to enter the Graphics Device
Interface (GDI) and USER at the same time. The results can include problems at
the viewer (scrambled screens or program halts), and even screen corruption on
the client.

Windows 95 or Windows 98 with Winsock 1.1 (that is, the release version of
Windows 95, or Windows 98 with Winsock 2.0 support removed) has the following
architecture as interpreted by 16-bit applications and DLLs:

 16-bit application or DLL
        |
  Winsock.dll    (16-bit winsock interface, pure 16-bit code)
        |           user
  ------------------------
        |           kernel
  Wsock.vxd

In Windows 95 or Windows 98 with Winsock 2.0 (with only Microsoft TCP/IP provider
installed, the shipping configuration) it has changed to the following:


16-bit application or DLL
        |
  Winsock.dll    (16-bit winsock interface, pure 16-bit code)
        |
  Ws2thl.dll     (thunking layer between 16-bit and 32-bit code)
        |
  Ws2_32.dll     (Winsock2 broker library, 32-bit code)
        |
  Msafd.dll      (TCP/IP service provider, 32-bit code)
        |              user
  ---------------------------
        |              kernel
  Wsock2.vxd

Wuser.exe (Idisp16.dll) is a 16-bit DLL being called inside a 32-bit process. It
makes 16-bit Winsock calls and relies on the Winsock 1.1 behavior of going
straight to kernel without thunking into 32-bit code. With Winsock 2.0, when
Winsock.dll thunks to 32-bit code, the 32-bit scheduler can (and very often
does) preempt a currently executing thread and then executes another 32-bit
thread in the same or different 32-bit process. When this occurs, the 16-bit DLL
code can get reentered and halt the program, because a 16-bit environment
assumes that no reentrancy will occur when it makes a Winsock call.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either NetBIOS or IPX as the default protocol
for Systems Management Server Remote Control.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before applying this hotfix, back up the entire Systems Management Server site
server.

NOTE: This hotfix requires Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 4 to be
installed before the hotfix can be applied.

To install the hotfix using the installation program provided, do the following
at the Systems Management Server site server:

1. Run Q193269_ENU_i386_zip.exe.

NOTE: To download this tool, click on the following:

  ftp://hotfix.microsoft.com/sms/Systems_Management_Server_1.2/sp5/Q193269/

2. This Systems Management Server Installer package installs the following new
  files in your Systems Management Server site server's
  &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\X86.bin directory:

      Cli_dos.exe
     CoExst9x.dll
      IDisp9x.dll
     IDispThk.dll
        Imp9x.dll
     Loc16VC0.dll
     MultPr9x.dll
      Queue9x.dll
      VUser9x.vxd
     WouDat9x.dll
      Wuser9x.exe

3. This package then installs the following new files in your Systems Management
  Server site server's
  &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\X86.bin\00000409 directory:

       CL_W95.mod
      WUMsg9x.dll
     _IDisp9x.dll
     _Wuser9x.dll

4. This package then modifies the System.map file to support the installation of
  these new files to the Windows 95 and Windows 98 clients.

5. After the Systems Management Server services are restarted, the files are
  replicated by Maintenance Manager to all Systems Management Server logon
  servers to the SMS\Logon.srv\X86.bin directory. When that occurs, the clients
  can be updated.

To update the clients, either manually run Upgrade.bat on each client or follow
the instructions in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q166771 SMS: How to Force Site-Wide Client Updates

To install the hotfix manually, perform the steps below at the Systems Management
Server site server.

WARNING: This method involves making changes to the System.map file. Editing the
System.map file incorrectly can damage your site installation, and should only
be done according to this specific procedure or at the direction of Systems
Management Server Support.

1. Stop the SMS_EXECUTIVE, SMS_SITE_CONFIG_MANAGER, and SMS_HIERARCHY_MANAGER
  services.

2. Copy the following files into the
  &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\X86.bin directory:

      Cli_dos.exe
     CoExst9x.dll
      IDisp9x.dll
     IDispThk.dll
        Imp9x.dll
     Loc16VC0.dll
     MultPr9x.dll
      Queue9x.dll
      VUser9x.vxd
     WouDat9x.dll
      Wuser9x.exe

3. Copy the following files into the
  &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\X86.bin\00000409 directory:

       CL_W95.mod
      WUMsg9x.dll
     _IDisp9x.dll
     _Wuser9x.dll

4. Make a backup copy of the current System.map file.

5. Remove 16-bit WUSER support for Windows 95 and Windows 98. To do this, search
  the System.map file, and look for the Wuser.exe entry in the section titled:

  DIRECTORY "SITE.SRV\MAINCFG.BOX\CLIENT.SRC\X86.BIN"
  PLATFORM "INTEL X86" LANGUAGE "" SOURCE "X86\INTNL" FLAGS = 10
  UNIT = "INTEL CLIENT"

6. Remove Wuser.exe from the WIN95 CopyList. To do this, look under the line for
  Wuser.exe; the following line needs to be changed from:

  REMOTE=YES,   COPYLISTS("WIN16:REMOTE_CONTROL" = "SMS", "WIN95:REMOTE_CONTROL" = "SMS"), COMPRESS=NO, FLAGS = 5

  To:

  REMOTE=YES,   COPYLISTS("WIN16:REMOTE_CONTROL" = "SMS"), COMPRESS=NO, FLAGS = 5

7. Remove Vuser.386 from the WIN95 CopyList. To do this, look under the line for
  Vuser.386; the following line needs to be changed from:

   REMOTE=YES,   COPYLISTS("WIN16:REMOTE_CONTROL_386" = "WINDIR", "WIN95:REMOTE_CONTROL_386" = "WINDIR"), COMPRESS=NO, FLAGS = 1

  To:

   REMOTE=YES,   COPYLISTS("WIN16:REMOTE_CONTROL_386" = "WINDIR"), COMPRESS=NO, FLAGS = 1

8. Search the System.map file looking for the _Wuser.dll entry in the section
  titled:

  DIRECTORY "SITE.SRV\MAINCFG.BOX\CLIENT.SRC\X86.BIN\00000409"
  PLATFORM "INTEL X86" LANGUAGE "ENGLISH" SOURCE "X86\ENGLISH" FLAGS = 10
  UNIT = "INTEL CLIENT"

9. Remove _Wuser.dll from the WIN95 CopyList. To do this, look under the line
  for _Wuser.dll; the following line needs to be changed from:

  REMOTE=YES,   COPYLISTS("WIN16:REMOTE_CONTROL" = "SMS", "WIN95:REMOTE_CONTROL" = "SMS"), COMPRESS=NO, FLAGS = 5

  To:

  REMOTE=YES,   COPYLISTS("WIN16:REMOTE_CONTROL" = "SMS"), COMPRESS=NO, FLAGS = 5

10. Merge the new additions that are located in the enclosed System.ma_ file.
  The headers for each section in the System.ma_ file are included for
  reference, but you only need to merge the new lines into the appropriate
  matching section in the System.map file. Pay attention to these headers
  because some do look similar, but are definitely not the same.

  NOTE: Look for Wuser.exe in a X86 platform, and Wusermsg.dll for the same
  platform, and then merge into those areas.

11. Restart the SMS_EXECUTIVE, SMS_SITE_CONFIG_MANAGER, and
  SMS_HIERARCHY_MANAGER services.

12. Wait for the copylist files to be upgraded from the System.map and the new
  files to be replicated by Maintenance Manager to the SMS\Logon.srv\X86.bin
  directory on all Systems Management Server logon servers. When that occurs,
  the clients can be updated.

To update the clients, either manually run Upgrade.bat on each client or follow
the instructions in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
