SYMPTOMS
========

On computers with Pentium II processors, Invos2 reports the processor as a
486DX.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. If you are not severely affected by this
specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Systems
Management Server service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information on support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  08/17/98   02:32pm            151,981 Invos2.exe   (x86)


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems Management
Server version 1.2.

The third-party products discussed here are manufactured by vendors independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To manually install the hotfix, perform the following steps on the Systems
Management Server site server:

1. In the &lt;SMS_root_directory&gt;\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\X86.bin
  directory on the site server, replace the Invos2.exe file with the version
  obtained from the hotfix.

  NOTE: You can perform Step 1 automatically by using Hotfix.exe with the
  provided Hotfix.ini file.

2. The file will be replicated at the next Maintenance Manager work cycle to all
  Systems Management Server logon servers to the SMS\Logon.srv\X86.bin
  directory. When that occurs, the clients can be updated.

  To update the clients, either manually run Upgrade.bat on each client, or
  follow the instructions in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
  Base:
