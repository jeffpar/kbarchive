-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0SP1, 3.0SP2, 3.0SP3, 4.0, 4.0SP1, 4.0SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to insert a resource object within SNA Manager (an LU, user, or
IP address, for instance), you get the following error message:

  SNA OLE the number of objects has reached their limit.

SNA Server Manager abruptly closes, and a Dr. Watson in Snaexp.exe may occur
closing SNA Server Manager.

CAUSE
=====

The reason for these errors is that SNA Server's Com.cfg file has reached the
object limit of 65,535 objects. No more objects can be inserted until the
existing number of objects has been decreased. This is an architectural limit
that cannot be subverted. The following information is from the SNA Server 4.0
Service Pack 1 Readme:

  This release of SNA Server supports a maximum of 65,536 configuration objects
  in one SNA Server subdomain. Configuration objects represent configurable
  components of SNA Server, such as link services, connections, or logical
  units. If you attempt to go over the limit, SNA Server warns you with a
  beep.

  If you need to define more than 65,536 objects, it is recommended that you
  create an additional SNA Server subdomain or delete any unnecessary
  configuration information.

RESOLUTION
==========

Another SNA Server in a new subdomain must be created to offload the number of
objects. The 65,535 limit is for the subdomain (Com.cfg), and adding one more
SNA Server within the existing subdomain will not be possible.
