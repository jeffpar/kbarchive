-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) client, it tries to
renew its lease on an existing IP address for its scope (Requesting state). Or
in the case of the client never having an address, it will try to obtain a lease
for an IP address for its scope (Initializing state). In the case where there
are two or more DHCP servers on the network configured to service this segment,
and a DHCP server has the scope for this segment disabled, the client may
receive a negative acknowledgment (DHCPNAK) from the DHCP server with the
disabled scope. If the client is running Windows NT Server or Workstation, the
DHCPNAK would cause an event to be logged to the Windows NT System Event log.
This will also increase network traffic and cause the client to needlessly fall
back to an Initializing state.

Previous to Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4, this behavior was not present. This
applies to Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5 as well.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT Server or Workstation 4.0
------------------------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or the
individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
pack, please go to:

Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
----------------------------------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT Server
4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Administrators find that configuring two DHCP servers for the same scope then
disabling one is an easy way to provide limited fault tolerance.

When the server with the active scope is unavailable, the DHCP server with the
deactivated scope will assume the responsibilities for the DHCP clients of that
scope.

For more information on how to configure DHCP, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q139904 How to Configure Your DHCP Server Scope
