MORE INFORMATION
================

The following files are available for download from the Microsoft Download

  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/masm61/Patch/6.14/W9XNT4/EN-US/Ml614.exe)

For additional information about how to download Microsoft Support files, click

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. After it is posted, the file is housed on
secure servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

NOTE You can use MASM 6.14 to develop applications that run under MS-DOS or
Windows 3.1x, but the assembler (ml.exe) requires Windows 9x, or Windows NT. If
you need to use MASM on an MS-DOS or Windows 3.1x machine, version 6.11d is the
latest version capable of running under these operating systems. A patch to
update version 6.11 to version 6.11d can be obtained by contacting Microsoft
Product Support at

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS
  (http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS)

The files provided in ML614.exe do not patch MASM version 6.11c, which was made
available only in the Windows NT version 3.5 DDK and Windows 95 DDK, in the form
of the files ML.exe and ML.err. You must replace these two files with their
version 6.11 counterparts prior to installing the 6.14 patch. You can reinstall
the ML.exe and ML.err files for MASM version 6.11 from the original disks. To do
this, select Copy a File From the Distribution Disks from Setup's Main menu and
specify ML.exe and ML.err.

MASM 6.11 is no longer available as a retail product. There are currently two
ways to obtain MASM 6.11:

1. As a fulfillment option for Visual C++, if you have a registered copy of
  Visual C++, you can contact Microsoft at 1-800-360-7561 to obtain a copy of
  MASM 6.11 for the cost of shipping &amp; handling. The supplemental part
  number is 016-051-S02.

2. MASM 6.11 is included with some levels of the Microsoft Developer Network
  (MSDN). You can order MSDN by contacting Microsoft Sales and Service at
  1-800-426-9400.
