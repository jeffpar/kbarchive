SYMPTOMS
========

While you are playing a game on Zone.com, your computer may be disconnected from
the Internet.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if your modem or Internet connection settings are
configured to disconnect your computer from the Internet when your connection is
idle for a certain length of time.

While you are playing a game on Zone.com, your modem or Web browser may not
monitor game-related network activity when it attempts to determine if your
connection is idle.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, disable the automatic disconnection feature, or increase
the length of time for which the connection must be idle before the computer is
disconnected from the Internet. To do this, use one of the following methods.

Configure Your Modem Connection Settings
----------------------------------------

To configure your modem connection settings, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Modems.

3. In the "The following modems are set up on this computer" box, click your
  modem, and then click Properties.

4. On the Connection tab, click to clear the "Disconnect a call if idle for more
  than &lt;number&gt; mins" check box, or type a higher number in the mins box,
  and then click OK.

5. Click Close.

6. Close Control Panel.

Configure Your Internet Connection Settings
-------------------------------------------

To configure your Internet connection settings, use the appropriate steps for
your Internet connection.

Internet Explorer 4.x or Later:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Internet or Internet Settings.

3. On the Connection or Connections tab, click Settings.

4. In the Dial-up Settings box, click the dial-up connection you use to connect
  to the Internet, and then click Settings.

5. If you are using Internet Explorer 4.x, proceed to the next step. If you are
  using Internet Explorer 5.0, click Advanced.

6. Click to clear the "Disconnect if idle for &lt;number&gt; minutes" check box,
  or type a higher number in the minutes box.

7. Click OK until you return to Control Panel.

8. Close Control Panel.

MSN, The Microsoft Network:

1. Click the The Microsoft Network icon on the taskbar, point to MSN Options,
  and then click Connection Settings.

2. On the Options tab, click to clear the "Disconnect if idle for more than
  &lt;number&gt; minutes" check box, or type a higher number in the minutes
  box.

3. Click OK.

America Online (AOL):

You cannot configure the idle time disconnect feature in the AOL software. If you
use AOL to connect to the Internet, you may periodically receive the following
message:

  "You have been idle for a while. Do you want to stay online?"

When you receive this message, click Yes to stay connected to the Internet.
