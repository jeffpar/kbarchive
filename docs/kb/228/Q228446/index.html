SYMPTOMS
========

When you have documents based on templates with customized Outline Numbering
styles, the tab or indent settings (or both) may unexpectedly change. This
problem occurs when you select the "Automatically update document styles" check
box or open a document that already has this option turned on.

This problem is intermittent and can be difficult to reproduce. The document is
being incorrectly modified when it is updated from the template using the
"Automatically update document styles" feature.

The following may occur in the document:

- The space between the number or bullet and the paragraph text changes.

-or-

- The left paragraph indent changes.

-or-

- Both of these can occur.

These changes can occur even though the template's style definitions are still
correctly defined.

CAUSE
=====

The "Automatically update document styles" feature has been turned on.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do not turn on the "Automatically update document styles" feature.

1. On the Tools menu, click Templates and Add-Ins.

2. If the "Automatically update document styles" check box is selected, click to
  clear the check box.

If your document has already been incorrectly modified because the "Automatically
update document styles" setting was turned on, you can use one of the following
procedures to correct the document formatting:

Method 1: Reset the Outline Numbering Scheme in the Document

1. On the Format menu, click Bullets and Numbering.

2. Click the Outline Numbered tab and click OK.

NOTE: You do not need to change or modify the selected numbering scheme.
Method 2: Use the Organizer to Manually Copy the Style(s) from the Template to
the Document

For more information about how to copy styles using the organizer, click
"Contents and Index" on the Help menu, click the Index tab in Contents and Index
Help, type the following text

  styles, copy

and then double-click the selected text to go to the "Copy styles, AutoText
entries, toolbars, or macros" topic. If you are unable to find the information
you need, ask the Office Assistant.
