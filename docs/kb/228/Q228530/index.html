-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- The Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL) 3.0, used with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 6.0 
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Learning Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you create an ATL Composite control with other ActiveX controls embedded in
it, you may get an access violation in Ole32.dll. Usually, a message box is
displayed with the following error message:

  Unhandled exception in EXENAME.EXE(OLE32.DLL): 0xC0000005: Access Violation"
  is displayed.

You may also see a Web Browser control displayed with the following message,
instead of the child ActiveX control:

  This page cannot be displayed.

Usually, these controls work correctly on computers with Visual C++ installed,
but do not work on computers without Visual C++ installed.

CAUSE
=====

The ActiveX controls embedded in the Composite control may be licensed controls.
Composite controls and ATL containment do not directly support creation of
licensed controls.

When the Composite control attempts to create a licensed control on a computer
without providing a run-time license, the Composite control fails with an
HRESULT of 0x80040112 (CLASS_E_NOTLICENSED - Class is not licensed for use). The
default handling of this failure creates a Web Browser control; the default
handling also tries to initialize the Web Browser control with persisted
properties of the licensed control. This mismatch of properties may result in an
access violation in the Ole32.dll file.

If there is no access violation, the Web Browser control attempts to navigate to
a URL that is the string representation of the licensed control's CLSID. This
action results in the error message "The page cannot be displayed."

RESOLUTION
==========

Download the Atlhostlic.h file (contained in ATLHostLic.exe and a modified
version of the Atlhost.h file), which allows licensed controls inserted on
Composite controls to work correctly. Copy this file to your project directory
and change all #include statements that reference the original Atlhost.h file to
reference the Atlhostlic.h file.

Note that this solution works only for debug and minimum-dependency builds. All
changes from the original Althost.h file are marked with the comments "BEGIN
CHANGE" and "END CHANGE".

This solution may not work when creating ActiveX controls dynamically by using
the Win32 CreateWindow function with the control properties passed in as the
last parameter.

servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create an ATL DLL project and insert a Composite control object in the
  project.

2. In the Composite control dialog box, insert the Microsoft TreeView Control.

3. Build and test the control on any container.

4. Test the control on a computer without Visual C++ installed and you should
  see the error described in the "Symptoms" section.
