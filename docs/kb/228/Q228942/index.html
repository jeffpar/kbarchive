-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP4 
- Microsoft Windows NT Load Balancing Service 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you apply Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4) to your computer running
Windows NT Load Balancing Service (WLBS), the following problems may occur:

- On a WLBS host that consistently experiences heavy loads of traffic, WLBS may
  stop servicing client requests. Although the cluster can converge, IP
  connectivity is disrupted.

- The WLBS cluster does not converge. The 'wlbs query' command returns:

  "converging with the following hosts:".

  NOTE: The command should at least display the WLBS cluster converging with
  itself, even if it was the only host in the cluster.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS)
incorrectly thinks WLBS is out of resources and stops sending WLBS packets to
the Media Access Control driver. This behavior occurs because of a WLBS
incompatibility with NDIS performance enhancements made in SP4.

RESOLUTION
==========
