SUMMARY
=======

The Certificate Wizard that comes with Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0
makes managing server certificates easier than ever before. This article
describes how to create a certificate request file using the wizard.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The first step you will need to perform to get a server certificate is creating
the request file. To generate a new certificate request (to be sent to a
certificate authority or CA for processing), perform the following steps:

NOTE: The certificate request fails if it contains non-alphanumeric characters.
NOTE: Between creating the request file (that is, completing the steps in this
article) and installing the certificate, do NOT perform any of the following
actions:

- Change the computer name or Web site bindings.

- Apply service packs or security patches.

- Change encryption levels (that is, apply the high encryption pack).

- Delete the pending certificate request.

- Change any of the Web site's Secure Communications properties.

1. Open the Internet Services Manager (or your custom MMC containing the IIS
  snap-in).

2. Browse to the site where you want to enable secure communications.

3. Right-click the friendly name of the site and go to properties.

4. Click the Directory Security tab.

5. Under the Secure Communications section, click Server Certificate.

6. This starts the new Web Site Certificate Wizard.

7. Click Next.

8. Choose the Create a New Certificate option and click Next (there should be a
  slight pause before the next screen appears).

9. Choose the Prepare a New Request but Send it Later option and click Next.

  NOTE: The Send the request immediately to an online certification authority
  option is unavailable unless IIS has access to an Enterprise CA, which
  requires Certificate Server 2.0 to be installed in Microsoft Windows 2000
  with Active Directory.

10. Choose a Friendly Name for the site (this can be anything you want it to be,
  for example, the friendly name of the site in the MMC, or the name of the
  customer the Web site belongs to).

11. Choose the bit length of the key you want to use and whether you want to use
  SGC (Server Gated Cryptography), and then click Next.

  NOTE: For more information on bit length and SGC, see the IIS Help that is
  located on the server at the following address:

  http://&lt;servername&gt;/iishelp/iis/htm/core/iistesc.htm

  Note that in order for this URL to work, you must replace server name with
  the name of your IIS server.

12. Input your Organization (O) and your Organizational Unit (OU). For example,
  if your company is called Widgets and you are setting up a Web server for
  the Sales department, you would enter Widgets for the Organization and Sales
  for your Organizational Unit. Click Next when complete.

13. Input the common name (CN) for your site. This should be the same name that
  the user will input when requesting your Web site. For example, if a user
  inputs http://www.widgets.microsoft.com to access your Web site, then your
  Common Name would be www.widgets.microsoft.com. When you are complete, click
  Next.

14. Input you Country/Region, City, and State. It is very important that you do
  not abbreviate the names of the state or city. When complete, click Next.

15. Enter the contact information for the person responsible for this
  certificate or Web site. This is usually how the Certificate Authority
  contacts you, and then click Next.

16. Choose a name for the certificate request file you are about to create. This
  file will contain all the information you created here, as well as your
  public key for your site. You can browse the file name if you want. This
  creates a .txt file when you are complete. The default name for the file is
  Certreq.txt. When you have finished this step, click Next.

17. You will now be presented with a summary screen of all the information you
  entered. Make sure all this information is correct, and then click Next.

18. You have now created your certificate request file.

In order for this certificate to be used, submit this file to a Certificate
Authority (online authority). They will generate a certificate response file,
which contains your public key and is digitally signed by the Certificate
Authority. To install this certificate, use the steps in the following Microsoft
Knowledge Base article:

  SSL/TLS
