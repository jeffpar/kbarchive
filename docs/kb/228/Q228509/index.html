-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Outlook 97, version 8.04 
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When an Outlook user modifies an occurrence of a recurring meeting request by
adding another attendee, the new attendee, if using Outlook 97 (8.04), cannot
open the meeting request.

When the new attendee attempts to open the update meeting request, the following
message appears:

  Microsoft Outlook
  Unable to open meeting item "&lt;subject of meeting request&gt;".

Expected Results:

The Outlook 97 version 8.04 user expects the meeting to open and to be allowed to
accept or reject it.

Only newly-added attendees are unable to open the meeting update notification. If
you use Outlook 97 version 8.03, you can open the updated meeting message.
Newly-added attendees cannot open the updated meeting message if they are using
either the Service Release 2 (SR2) update to Outlook 97 (or Office 97) or the
Year 2000 update. Original attendees do not experience any problem with the
meeting update, regardless of client version. The problem is in the creation of
the recurring meeting in the Calendar.
