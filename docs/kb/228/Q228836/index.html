SUMMARY
=======

In order to provide secure communications (SSL/TLS) in Internet Information
Services (IIS) 5.0, a server certificate is required on the site you want to
provide the service on.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before the following steps can be completed, you must first generate a
certificate request, and then send it to an online authority (certificate
authority). If you have not done this, perform the steps in the following
Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q228821 Generating a Certificate Request File Using Certificate Wizard in IIS
  5.0

When you receive your response file from the online authority, you will need to
install this on the Web server.

NOTE: The response file contains your public key that has been signed by the
authority. A client can successfully connect to the site without trusting the
authority who issued the server certificate. However, if the client does not
trust the authority, a security prompt that says "The security certificate was
issued by a company you have not chosen to trust. View the certificate to
determine whether you want to trust the certifying authority." appears each time
the client connects. The client is given the option to continue or view the
certificate at this point.

To install the response file, follow these steps:

1. Open Internet Services Manager, or the custom MMC containing the Internet
  Information Services snap-in.

2. Expand Internet Information Services (if needed) and browse to the Web site
  you have a pending certificate request on.

3. Right-click on the site and then click Properties.

4. Click the Directory Security tab.

5. Under the Secure Communications section, click Server Certificate.

6. On the Web Site Certificate Wizard, click Next.

7. Choose to Process the Pending Request and Install the Certificate. Click
  Next.

8. Type in the location of the certificate response file (you may also browse to
  the file), and then click Next.

9. Read the summary screen to be sure that you are processing the correct
  certificate, and then click Next.

10. You will see a confirmation screen. When you have read this information,
  click Next.

You now have a server certificate installed. You may want to test the Web site to
ensure that everything is working correctly. Be sure to use https:// when you
test connectivity to the site.
