The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to print from a computer running Windows NT 4.0 or Windows NT 4.0,
Terminal Server Edition, you may receive the following blue screen error
message:

  STOP 0x0000000A (0x00000000, 0x00000002, 0x00000000, 0x80109727)

NOTE: The fourth parameter varies depending on the version of Windows NT you are
using, but always reports the Ntoskrnl.exe file.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the printer .dll files are started twice.

testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT 4.0 service pack that contains this fix.
