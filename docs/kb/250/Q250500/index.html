The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
- Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server 
- Microsoft Exchange 2000 Enterprise Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article provides Microsoft Product Support Services (PSS) with information
about how Sybari Antigen software interacts with Exchange Server and Antigen
software support boundaries.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sybari has released Antigen software for Exchange Server 5.5, Exchange 2000
Server, and Exchange 2000 Enterprise Server. Antigen is a unique virus-scanning
program, and it is important for Microsoft Support Professionals to understand
the way that Antigen software works and what the Microsoft position is on this
product.

How Antigen Works
-----------------

Sybari uses unsupported interfaces between the information store and the
Extensible Storage Engine (ESE). At the time of the publication of this article
no instances of corruption have been reported, but customers who use Antigen run
the risk of database corruption and potential data loss if there are errors in
Sybari Antigen implementation.

During installation, Antigen changes the Exchange Server Information Store
service so that it is dependent on the Sybari Antigen service. This ensures that
the Antigen service starts before the Exchange Server Information Store service
starts. During the startup process, the Antigen service checks for appropriate
versions of Antigen and Exchange Server, and appropriate file versions. If any
incompatibility is found, Antigen disables itself, enables the information store
to start (without antivirus protection), and notifies administrators.

When Antigen starts successfully, the Microsoft version of the Ese.dll file is
temporarily renamed to Xese.dll and the Sybari version of the Ese.dll file is
put in its place. After the Sybari version of the Ese.dll file is loaded, the
Microsoft version is renamed back to Ese.dll and the Exchange Server information
store is enabled to complete its startup process.

The Microsoft Position on Sybari Antigen
----------------------------------------

Based upon research on Sybari Antigen and the proven track record of the product,
Microsoft acknowledges that this product is an innovative solution to meet the
antivirus needs of customers. Customers who contact Microsoft Product Support
Services may be asked to disable the Sybari Antigen service to help identify
issues, but customers are free to re-enable the software after the root cause of
the issue is properly diagnosed. Microsoft and Sybari agree that this is a valid
troubleshooting step to determine the cause of issues. To make this process as
simple as possible, Sybari includes a command-line utility with Antigen, the
Antutil.exe utility, that enables customers to quickly disable (/disable) and
enable (/enable) the Antigen service without removing the software. By default,
a copy of this file is installed in the following folder:

  Program Files\Sybari Software\Antigen for Exchange

may be contributing to an issue, Sybari requests that you include Sybari
