The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Pandora's Box, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start Microsoft Pandora's Box, you may receive the following
error message:

  Unable to create DirectDraw Surface. Make sure that DirectX is installed, and
  then try again.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if any of the following conditions are true:

- A Pentium III computer.

- Your monitor is not configured correctly.

- The video driver installed on the computer is incompatible with Microsoft
  DirectX.

- The video driver installed on the computer does not support a color palette
  higher than 256 colors.

- The video adapter installed in the computer does not meet the minimum
  hardware requirements necessary to run the game.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, download and install the Pandora's Box Update for the
game's English or French version (Pandora10a.exe) or for its Japanese version
(PandoraJ10a.exe) from the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/games/pandorasbox/downloads.htm

The self-extracting, self-installing files install two modified files: the
Pandora.exe file and the Langenu.dll file. The combined size of the downloaded
files is approximately one megabyte (MB).

NOTE: if you are using Pandora's Box Trial version it will not work on Pentium
III computers. The error message that you will get is

  Unable to create DirectDraw Surface. Make sure that DirectX is installed, and
  then try again.
