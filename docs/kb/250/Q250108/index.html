- Microsoft Asheron's Call: Dark Majesty, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Asheron's Call and log in to Zone.com, you may receive the
following message:

  Your Patron &lt;character name&gt; has been deleted from the game.

In addition, your character is no longer bound to the Allegiance.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if your character's Patron deletes his/her character.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a character's Patron deletes his/her character, all Allegiance information
is also deleted for that character's Vassals.

If those Vassals have Vassals of their own, they automatically become Monarchs of
their own Allegiance ranks.

If a Monarch deletes his/her character in Asheron's Call, the entire Monarchy is
dissolved.

Call, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
