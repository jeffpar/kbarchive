Microsoft Age of Empires 1.0c and Age of Empires: Rise of Rome 1.0a Readme File
December 1999
Microsoft Corporation, 1999

Microsoft Age of Empires 1.0c and Rise of Rome 1.0a are upgrades of Age of
Empires 1.0 and Rise of Rome 1.0 that include several enhancements and bug
fixes.

Contents
--------

a. Version Compatibility

b. Enhancements

c. Balance Changes

d. Bug Fixes

e. Uninstalling Age of Empires 1.0c and Rise of Rome 1.0a

Version Compatibility
---------------------

If you are playing a multiplayer game, all players must be using the same version
of Age of Empires and Rise of Rome.

Enhancements
------------

Idle Villager Key - Pressing the period ( . ) key selects and centers the view on
a villager or fishing boat that is not assigned a task. Pressing ( . ) cycles
though all idle villagers and boats in the game. This is a keyboard-only
command; there is no on-screen control for it.

Balance Changes
---------------

Shang Food Cost - The cost of a Shang villager was reduced to 40 food. The amount
of food the Shang player starts with was reduced by 40.

Phoenician Woodcutting Bonus - Phoenician villagers now work 15% faster. In
previous versions of Age of Empires, they worked 54% percent faster.

Bug Fixes
---------

Market Tribute Bug - If you have an incompletely built market, you can no longer
send a tribute until it is completed.

Wall Overrun Bug - If you build a wall from the inside of the map to the edge, it
will no longer build wall foundations all the way across the map.

Deleted Shallows Object Bug - If you delete shallows in the map editor, units can
no longer walk over the old shallows area.

Building Through Diagonal Walls Bug - A villager can no longer build a building
on the opposite side of a diagonal enemy wall.

Converted Dock Bug - You can no longer continue to trade at your dock after it
has been converted.

Farm Bug - When both a farmer and Farm are selected at the same time, pressing
"S" no longer causes the farm to replenish the amount of food available.

Building and Training at Incorrect Building Bug - You can no longer train units
at a building not intended for that purpose.

Cheats Removed from Multiplayer - The GAIA, Reveal Map, and No Fog cheats have
been removed from multiplayer.

Steroids Bug - Cheating in multiplayer games by using the Steroids cheat has been
prevented.

Anti-Trainer Technology - Technology has been added to Age of Empires to cause
multiplayer games to go out of sync if any of a variety of hacks are attempted.

Multiplayer Game Launching - Multiplayer games with larger numbers of players (6
or more) or with bad modem connections are much more likely to succeed on
launching.

Palmyran Free Tribute on Full Tech Tree Bug - When the Full Tech Tree option is
selected, the Palmyran civilization players no longer receive the free tribute
bonus.
