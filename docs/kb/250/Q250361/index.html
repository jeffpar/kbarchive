-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Migrated Lotus cc:Mail database version 8 (DB8) users who have personal address
book (PAB) entries may receive a message that has "Migrated Message File Address
Book (PAB)" as the subject, which contains instructions to import the .pab file
attached to the message as a Microsoft Mail File (.mmf) for the Microsoft
Outlook client for Windows 95 and Windows NT.

If the migrated user follows the instructions in the message to import the
attached .pab file, blank Outlook contacts are created for each cc:Mail PAB
entry, and empty personal distribution list (PDL) entries are created for each
cc:Mail personal mailing list entry.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

1. Remove the blank Outlook contacts and empty Outlook personal DLs.

2. Perform the following steps to import the attached .pab file as a personal
  address book:

  a. Open the message that has "Migrated Message File Address Book (PAB)" as
     the subject, and on the File menu, click Save Attachments.

  b. Type the location where you want to save the .pab file and type a file
     name that you want to save the .pab file as, and then click Save.

  c. From the main menu in Outlook, on the File menu, click Import and Export,
     click Import from another program or file, and then click Next.

  d. In the "Select file type to import from" list, click Personal Address
     Book, and then click Next.

  e. Type the location of the .pab file that you saved in step b, click Open,
     and then click OK.

  f. After the .pab file has been imported, click OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 3.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Wizard. For additional information about how to add a Pabmsg.txt file, click the
