-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When installing the SNA Host Account Cache Service, also known as the
SNADATABASE Service, to be used in a secondary (backup) role, the following
event may be observed multiple times in the application log of the event viewer
where the primary (master) Host Account Cache Service is running:

  Event 1322 - Type:Error

  A backup database was denied access to the master database. Supplied code 0x0

Once the backup SNA Host Account Cache (HAC) Service has started, a request is
sent to contact the primary HAC Service. If successful, a copy of the HAC user
database (DBase.DBS) is copied down locally. If the request fails, the following
event is recorded in the application log of the event viewer on that (backup)
computer:

  Event 1002 - Type:Error

  A message could not be sent. Supplied code &lt;0xe160052a&gt;

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT service account being used on the backup HAC is not the same
service account as the primary HAC Service. For more information on Host
Security Service Accounts, please see the following knowledge base article:

  Q235472 All Host Security Services Must Run in Same Windows NT Account

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the backup SNA Host Account Cache Service to use the same Windows NT
account credentials that the primary SNA Host Account Cache Service is using.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Having additional backup HAC Services may help in eliminating network traffic
when Single Sign-On (SSO)lookups are being performed. For more information on
the algorithm used, please see the following knowledge base article:

  Q248479 - Host Account Database Location for Single Sign-On

Since the PDC must contain the primary Host Account Cache, all other
installations of this Service will be considered backups. If only the HAC
component was selected during the installation process (from the \HOSTSEC
directory on the SNA Server CD), you will never be prompted for the role (either
primary or backup) during the setup process. The primary Host Account Cache
always resides on the PDC of the domain.
