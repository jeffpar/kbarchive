  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes possible problems that are related to using a Network
Appliance file server in a mixed environment with Windows NT Server. This
article refers to Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0 as the affected software
that is running on Microsoft Windows NT, but this information can apply to any
Win32-based program that connects to a NetApp file server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

When a Windows NT-based client computer connects to a NetApp file server, the
client may receive the following error message:

  Error 1721: Not enough resources are available to complete this operation.

Note that this is what is returned from the client redirector to the
Windows-based program. The error message that is displayed by the client may and
probably will be different.

This is most likely to occur with Directory Change notifications when connecting
to a UNC address. The problem is that the NetApp file server negotiates low
LongTermEntries thresholds with the Windows NT-based client; when the client
reaches this threshold, the Windows NT redirector returns an error to the
Windows-based program, stating that it is unable to post change notifications to
the server.

Although this may appear to be a Windows NT issue, the problem is with the file
server. When this issue occurs, it looks as if the client software (IIS) is not
updating content, but in reality the server negotiated the limit; the client
only enforces this limit by returning an error to the Windows-based program.

A fix for this issue is available to Network Appliance customers. The fix is
contained in patch releases 5.3.4R2P1 and 5.3.4R2P2. The fix will be in all
subsequent patch releases for 5.3.4 and in subsequent maintenance releases as
well. The patch releases are available from the Network Appliance Web site.

As a troubleshooting step and/or workaround, disable ASP and static file
caching.

To disable ASP file caching, perform the following steps:

1. Open the Internet Service Manager (ISM).

2. Right-click the &lt;computer name&gt;, and then click Properties.

3. Click the Edit button to edit the WWW Service Master Properties.

4. On the Home Directory tab, click the Configuration button.

5. On the Process Options tab, click the "Do not cache ASP files" option.

6. Click Apply, click OK to save your changes, and then restart IIS.

To disable static file caching, you must add the following value to the following
registry key:

  HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Inetinfo\Parameters DisableMemoryCache

  REG_DWORD: 1
