SUMMARY
=======

In some cases, you may want to stop SNA Server from retrying BIND attempts when
an APPC or CPI-C application is attempting to establish a conversation.

One instance where it might be useful to stop the BIND retries is if APPC or
CPI-C sessions are configured on the SNA Server to connect to a CICS region on
the mainframe, and the CICS region is down. By default, the SNA Server tries to
reestablish the sessions until the region is available. This behavior can cause
unwanted network traffic and can cause the Event Log on the server to fill up
with Event 18 messages reporting failed BIND attempts. NOTE: SNA Server 4.0 and
later will not log multiple Event 18 messages for each failed BIND attempt on
the same LU/LU/Mode triplet.

MORE INFORMATION
================

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry.
Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you
understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information
about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following
article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To stop continuous BIND retries, add the following registry entry to the SNA
Server:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SnaServr\Parameters

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry
  values:

  Value Name: BINDRETRY
  Data Type:  REG_DWORD
  Value:      0

4. Quit Registry Editor and restart the Snaservr service to activate the
  changes.

With this registry change SNA Server sends a BIND request when an APPC or CPIC
application sends [MC]ALLOCATE or CMALLC, but it will not retry if the BIND
attempt fails.
