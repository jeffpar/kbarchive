SYMPTOMS
========

The Offset argument of the GetChunk method is used to set the number of bytes to
skip before copying begins within a Memo or Long Binary Field.

However, when the Memo field is included in the GROUP BY clause of the
recordset's SELECT statement, the Offset argument is being ignored. This causes
the characters from the beginning of the field to be retrieved instead of the
characters beginning at the Offset position. For example, if the Memo field
contains 500 characters and the Offset and Numbytes arguments are set to 250,
GetChunk returns the first 250 characters instead of the last 250 characters as
would be expected.

RESOLUTION
==========

Rewrite the query to eliminate all Memo fields from the GROUP BY clause. This
can be done by using an aggregate function on the Memo fields, such as the FIRST
function. This allows the Memo fields to be removed from the GROUP BY clause.
This workaround is illustrated in the example code below.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Jet 4.0 has new functionality that allows you to use MEMO fields (Long
Varchar) in the GROUP BY clause of a SQL statement. This is not available in
earlier versions of the Jet database engine.

NOTE: The workaround SQL statement works with older versions of Jet.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. On the Project menu, select References, and add a reference to the Microsoft
  DAO 3.6 object library.

3. Add the following code to the Form_Load() Event:

  Dim dbsNorthwind As Database
  Dim rstEmployees As Recordset
  Dim sQry As String
  Const conChunkSize = 60
  Dim lngOffset As Long
  Dim lngTotalSize As Long
  Dim strChunk As String
      
    Set dbsNorthwind = OpenDatabase("nwind.mdb")

    'Comment this line out to see the correct behavior.
    sQry = "SELECT FirstName, LastName, Notes FROM Employees " &amp; _
           "GROUP BY FirstName, LastName, Notes"

    'Uncomment this line to see the correct behavior
    'sQry = "SELECT Employees.LastName, Employees.FirstName, First(Employees.Notes) " &amp; _
            "AS Notes From Employees GROUP BY Employees.LastName, Employees.FirstName"

    Set rstEmployees = dbsNorthwind.OpenRecordset(sQry, dbOpenDynaset)
    Do While Not rstEmployees.EOF
      lngTotalSize = rstEmployees("Notes").FieldSize
      Do While lngOffset &lt; lngTotalSize
        strChunk = rstEmployees("Notes").GetChunk(lngOffset, conChunkSize)
        Debug.Print strChunk
        lngOffset = lngOffset + conChunkSize
      Loop
    lngOffset = 0
    lngTotalSize = 0
    rstEmployees.MoveNext
    Loop

NOTE: You might have to adjust the path to NWIND.MDB.

4. The output from GetChunk is written to the Immediate Window, so make sure it
  is visible. If it is not, choose Immediate Window from the View menu.

5. Run the project, and note that the first 255 characters are repeated for all
  Memo fields that contain more than 255 characters.

6. Comment the first SQL statement and uncomment the second SQL statement.

7. Run the project, and note that you see the complete text of all Memo fields.
