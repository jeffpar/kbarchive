SYMPTOMS
========

When you check the spelling in a document, the spelling checker may constantly
recheck the same word.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when all of the following conditions are true:

- You click Change All in the spelling checker dialog box.

- The spelling checker finds more than one instance of a misspelled word.

- The misspelled word is not in the main or custom dictionaries.

WORKAROUND
==========

Press ESC to stop the spelling checker from constantly rechecking the same
word.

To prevent this problem from occurring, use any of the following methods:

Method 1: Add the Misspelled Word to the Custom Dictionary
----------------------------------------------------------

To add the misspelled word to your custom dictionary, either click Add in the
Spelling and Grammar dialog box, or right-click the misspelled word, and then
click Add on the shortcut menu.

Method 2: Use Replace to Correct Your Misspelled Word
-----------------------------------------------------

1. On the Edit menu, click Replace.

2. On the Replace tab, type the misspelled word in the Find what box.

3. Press TAB to the Replace with box.

4. Type your correction to the misspelled word and then click Replace All.

5. When you are prompted with "Word has completed its search of the document and
  has made &lt;n&gt; replacements," click OK.

  NOTE: &lt;n&gt; is the number of words that were replaced (corrected).

6. Click Close to quit the Find and Replace dialog box.

Method 3: Change Each Misspelled Word Individually
--------------------------------------------------

1. On the Tools menu, click Spelling and Grammar.

2. When Word selects (flags) a misspelled word, type in the corrected spelling.

3. Click Change All

4. When you are prompted with "You have chosen a word that is not found in the
  main or custom dictionaries. Do you want to use this word and continue
  checking?," click No.

  NOTE: The misspelled word is now changed and is still selected.

5. Click Ignore. The spelling checker continues to the next misspelled word.

6. Repeat your changes to the next misspelled word and then click Change.

7. Repeat steps 1-3 until the spelling check is complete.
