SUMMARY
=======

RDO 2.0 gives you the ability to handle asynchronous processing more elegantly
than RDO 1.0. Because Visual Basic allows objects to be dimensioned WithEvents,
you can use the events of the object as if it were a visual control, such as a
textbox, rather than constantly referring to properties such as StillExecuting.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This project is an example of dimensioning object's WithEvents using the events
of RDO 2.0's rdoConnection object. Be sure to change the connect string and
query string to correctly connect to and query your database.

The sample establishes an asynchronous connection to the database and runs an
asynchronous query. When the asynchronous calls are made, the CommandButton on
the form is disabled. The cbton is then re-enabled in the rdoConnection's
QueryComplete and Connect event. This code is more elegant than using a timer to
monitor the StillExecuting property repeatedly.

In the code below, note that the rdoConnection object variable MyConn is treated
almost like a visual control. From the code window, the MyConn object variable
is available from the dropdown list of available objects.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Begin by opening a new project and adding a reference to the Microsoft Remote
  Data Object 2.0. To add a reference, select References from the Project menu.

2. Place a CommandButton on the form and set its Name property to
  cmdOpenResultset.

3. Add the following code to the form. Be sure to modify the gstrConnect
  constant accordingly to ensure that RDO will connect to your database:

        Const gstrConnect As String = "DRIVER={SQL Server};" &amp; _
                                      "SERVER=YourServer;" &amp; _
                                      "DATABASE=pubs;" &amp; _
                                      "UID=sa;" &amp; _
                                      "PWD=;"
        Const gstrSQL As String = "SELECT * FROM Authors"

        Dim WithEvents MyConn As rdoConnection
        Dim MyRS As rdoResultset

        Private Sub Form_Load()
            Set MyConn = New rdoConnection
            MyConn.Connect = gstrConnect
            MyConn.CursorDriver = rdUseOdbc
            MyConn.EstablishConnection rdDriverNoPrompt, _
                                       False, _
                                       rdAsyncEnable
            cmdOpenResultset.Enabled = False
            Caption = "Opening Connection..."
        End Sub

        Private Sub cmdOpenResultset_Click()
            Set MyRS = MyConn.OpenResultset(gstrSQL, _
                                            rdOpenStatic, _
                                            rdConcurReadOnly, _
                                            rdExecDirect + rdAsyncEnable)
            cmdOpenResultset.Enabled = False
            Caption = "Running Query..."
        End Sub

        Private Sub MyConn_Connect(ByVal ErrorOccurred As Boolean)
            If ErrorOccurred Then
                Caption = "Error Occurred!"
            Else
                Caption = "Connection Established!"
                cmdOpenResultset.Enabled = True
            End If
        End Sub

        Private Sub MyConn_QueryComplete(ByVal Query As RDO.rdoQuery, _
                                         ByVal ErrorOccurred As Boolean)
            IF ErrorOccured Then
                Caption = "Error Occurred!"
            Else
                Caption = "Query Complete!"
                cmdOpenResultset.Enabled = True
            End IF
        End Sub

4. Run the project.
