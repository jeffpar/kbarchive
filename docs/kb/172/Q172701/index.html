-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

When you install a custom application created with the Microsoft Office 97
Developer Edition (ODE) Tools Setup Wizard, and that application includes ODBC
functionality and the run-time option, you may receive the following error
message

  The ODBC installer DLL (ODBCCP32.DLL) is not installed on this system.

followed by

  SQLInstallDriver failed for ODBC driver SQL Server.

and then:

  ODBC's SQLInstallTranslator failed while configuring Translator MSCPXL32.DLL.

Setup will then continue as normal. At the end of Setup, you receive the
following message:

  Setup was not completed successfully.

This behavior occurs if you are running Windows 95 and you installed the updated
ODBC drivers included in the following sources:

- ODBC 3.0 Driver Manager

- Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0 Service Pack 3

CAUSE
=====

The computer that you used to create the disk images for your custom application
contains updated versions of the ODBC files; however, the ODE Setup Wizard does
not include all of the files on the disk images.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install the Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools Service Pack 2 (ODESP2).
This update can be found at the following locations:

- In the \ValuPack\ODBC folder of the Microsoft Office 97 Service Release 1
  (SR-1) Enterprise Update CD.

- On the Microsoft Web site at:

  http://www.microsoft.com/OfficeDev/ProdInfo/ODESP2.htm.

NOTE: The Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools must be installed on the
computer before you try to install the ODESP2. If the ODE is not on the computer
when you start Setup, you will receive a message informing you that Setup could
not find the ODE installed on your hard disk.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. On a computer running Microsoft Windows 95, create a simple database with a
  startup form.

2. Start the ODE Setup Wizard.

3. In the screen that prompts you to add the files that you want your custom
  Setup program to copy, select the database you created in Step 1. Click Next.

4. Add a shortcut, and then click the Database Shortcut Properties tab. Click to
  select the Run-Time check box, and then click Next twice.

5. On the screen that asks "Which of the following components do you want to
  include," click "ODBC Support With SQL Server."

6. Click Next until you reach the last screen of the Setup Wizard, and then
  click Finish.

7. On a clean computer, run Setup from the disk images you created in step 6.

8. When the Welcome screen appears, click Next.

9. Select the folder into which you want to install the application, and then
  click OK.

  Note that you receive the error messages mentioned in the "Symptoms" section
  of this article.
