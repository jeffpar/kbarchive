SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the method for forcing a Routing and Remote Access (RRAS)
server for Windows NT 4.0 to authenticate RAS clients using PAP instead of CHAP,
SPAP, or MS-CHAP. This may be necessary, depending on your RAS clients or some
third-party authentication solutions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If your RRAS server is configured to "Allow any authentication including clear
text," a RAS client is able to connect with PAP, SPAP, CHAP, or MS- CHAP
depending, on what the client supports. Normally, a Microsoft RAS client will
attempt to connect with CHAP or MS-CHAP, if that is valid for the RAS server to
which it is connecting.

To force a RAS client to use PAP, you must delete the SPAP and CHAP registry keys
from your RAS Server using the following steps:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Go to the following subkey:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RasMan\PPP

3. Click SPAP, click Edit, and click Delete.

4. Click Yes to confirm the deletion.

5. Click CHAP, click Edit, and click Delete.

6. Click Yes to confirm the deletion.

7. Close Registry Editor and stop and restart the Routing and Remote Access
  Service.


NOTE: This will not work on normal Windows NT RAS servers, only Windows NT 4.0
RAS servers that have Routing and Remote Access installed. If you delete these
registry keys on a normal RAS server, the RAS services will fail to start after
you restart.

The following two scenarios require the above steps to force RAS clients to use
PAP authentication:

- You are using a PPP client that can only use PAP, but does not notify the RAS
  server that it needs to use PAP during the LCP negotiation.

  -or-

- You are using the new Radius client included in the Routing and Remote Access
  Service Update. Many Radius servers do not accept the attribute 60 CHAP
  Challenge that the Radius Client sends to the Radius server when
  authenticating a RAS client using CHAP. This is a valid attribute according
  to RFC 2058: "Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS)"; however,
  many older Radius servers cannot handle this newer attribute.
