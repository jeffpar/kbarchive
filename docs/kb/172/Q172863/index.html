-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server Installer version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an Execute Path statement has been added to the Install.log file so that an
external application will run when the application is removed, that external
application does not always start successfully. For an example, see the MORE
INFORMATION section of this article.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do either of the following:

- Create a batch file that contains the full command that that needs to be run.
  Then modify the Execute Path statement's command line to run the batch file.

-or-

- If the file that needs to be acted on by the executable is associated with
  that executable, the command line only needs to reference the file to be
  acted on. For example, the following command line would cause the Notetst.txt
  file to be displayed successfully in Notepad:

  " C:\Test\Notetst.txt" (without the quotation marks)

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
Installer version 1.0. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For example, if the following command is added to the Install.log, it would not
run successfully when the application is removed:

  " C:\TEST\NOTEPAD.EXE C:\TEST\NOTETST.TXT" (without the quotation marks)

The Installer script item would appear like:

  Add "Execute Path: %UNINSTP%\NOTEPAD.EXE %UNINSTP%\NOTETST.TXT" to
  INSTALL.LOG

From a normal command line, this would display the contents of the Notetst.txt
file in Notepad. The breaking point occurs when the command line references an
executable and subsequent file that the executable should act on.

If the command line only references an executable, it works correctly. In the
example above, Notepad will not start at all.
