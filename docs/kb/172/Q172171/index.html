SUMMARY
=======

An Administrator may wish to create Macintosh volumes in which Macintosh clients
only have the Write permission. This proposes a problem because the Macintosh
clients must be able to see the folder in order to write to it. Therefore, a
volume cannot be created where the Everyone group only has the Make Changes
permission. The volume must also have the See Folders permission. To accomplish
this task, you can create a volume that Macintosh users can see, then create a
folder in that volume that users can drag and drop files into without ever being
able to see the contents of the folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create folders in which Macintosh clients only have the Write Permission,
follow these steps on the Windows NT Server with Services for Macintosh
installed:

1. Create a default Macintosh Volume using the MacFile menu in File Manager
  (Winfile.exe). For example, create a directory called C:\MacFolder.

  If the Volume is already created, proceed to Step #2.

2. From the Macfile Menu, click Permissions. Check the following boxes for the
  Everyone group:

  X See Folders
  X See Files
  X Make Changes

3. Create a subdirectory in the Macintosh Volume. For example,
  C:\MacFolder\Files. Select this new Files folder.

4. From the MacFile menu, click Permissions. Check the following box for the
  Everyone group:

  X Make Changes

When Macintosh clients log into this Windows NT Server, they are able to select
the Macintosh volume with See Files and See Folders permission. After they have
selected this volume, the folder will appear on their desktop. When they
double-click on the folder (volume), the subdirectory Files will appear as a
normal folder but it will have a Belt around it. This prevents users from being
able to open the folder and viewing its contents, but will still be able to drag
and drop files into that folder.
