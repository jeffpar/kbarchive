The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a system runs Services for Macintosh and McAfee Anti-Virus software, you
may receive a blue screen STOP 0xA error or errors similar to the following:

  STOP: 0x0000000a (0x00000004, 0x00000002, 0x00000001, 0x8010b262)

  STOP: 0x0000000a (0x00000004 0x00000002 0x00000001 0x8010b262)
  IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL

  STOP: 0x00000024 (0x001901f9 0xf5c27c0c 0xf5c27a48 0x8010b260)
  NTFS_FILE_SYSTEM

CAUSE
=====

McAfee Anti-Virus software uses a filter driver. The presence of a filter driver
requires system drivers to allocate additional stack space in I/O request
packets (IRPs). An IRP in use by Services for Macintosh had insufficient space
for insertion of filter driver stack information. The result was the STOP 0xA
error message.

==========
