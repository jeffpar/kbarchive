-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use optical character recognition (OCR) software and attempt to scan
formatted text directly into Microsoft Word, nothing happens.

CAUSE
=====

Prior to Office 97, OCR software bundled with many scanners could scan formatted
text directly into Word. In Office 97, this may no longer work because the OCR
software depends on dialogs that were changed substantially in Office 97.
Therefore, the OCR software is unable to communicate with Office 97 programs.

WORKAROUND
==========

Your OCR software may work with Microsoft WordPad. If so, scan the text into
WordPad and save the document in Word for Windows 6.0 format or Rich Text Format
(RTF), or copy the text to Word 97 using the Clipboard.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Caere Corporation provides OCR software that does not work with Office 97, but
works with earlier versions of Office.


Caere Corporation, the vendor of OmniPage, WordScan, and other OCR software, is
aware of the problem and is preparing a version of their product that is
compatible with Office 97.
