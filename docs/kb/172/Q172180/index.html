SUMMARY
=======

This article describes information about headers or footers. It addresses what
headers and footers are, how they affect margin settings, how to position them,
how to create them, and what different types of headers and footers exist.

MORE INFORMATION
================

What Are Headers and Footers?
-----------------------------

A header or footer is text or graphics that is usually printed at the top or
bottom of every page in a document. A header is printed in the top margin; a
footer is printed in the bottom margin.

Headers and footers can be as simple as the document title and a page number, but
you can create headers and footers that contain graphics, multiple paragraphs,
and fields. You can specify a different header or footer for odd and even pages
or use a different header or footer for the first page of a section or document.
If you divide a document into sections, you can use different headers and
footers in each section. For example, you might want the header for each section
to reflect the title of that section.

Adding or Removing Headers and Footers
--------------------------------------

To create a header or footer, follow these steps:

1. On the View menu, click Header and Footer. Word displays the Header and
  Footer toolbar and switches to page layout view.

2. To switch between the header and footer, click the "Switch Between Header and
  Footer" icon on the Header and Footer toolbar.

A non-printing dashed line encloses the header and footer areas. Text and
graphics in the document are visible but dimmed. To display or hide the document
text, click the Show/Hide Document Text icon on the Header and Footer toolbar.

You can type and format text in the header or footer area the same way you do in
the main document. After you have created your header or footer, click Close on
the Header and Footer toolbar to return to the main part of the document. In
page layout view, the headers and footers are visible but appear dimmed.

To edit an existing header or footer, either click Header and Footer on the View
menu, or in page layout view, double-click a dimmed header or footer to switch
quickly to the header or footer.

To delete a header or footer, follow these steps:

1. Position the insertion point somewhere in the main text area of the document.

2. On the View menu, click Header and Footer.

3. Select the header or footer information you want to delete, and then press
  DELETE or BACKSPACE on the keyboard.

4. To return to the document, click Close on the Header and Footer toolbar, or
  double-click in the main text area of the document.

How Headers and Footers Affect Margin Settings
----------------------------------------------

Word prints headers and footers in the top and bottom margins. If the header or
footer is too large to fit in the margin, Word adjusts the top and bottom margin
to accommodate the header or footer. That is, if the header or footer becomes
too large to fit in the margin, it will start expanding downward (for the
header) and upward (for the footer), reducing the amount of document text that
can be displayed in the document window.

To prevent Word from moving the main document text (downward or upward) when the
header or footer gets too large to fit in the margin, follow these steps:

1. On the File menu, click Page Setup.

2. Click the Margins tab.

3. Type a hyphen (-) before the Top or Bottom margin setting.

NOTE: If the header or footer is too large, it may overwrite (superimpose) the
main document text.

Positioning Headers and Footers
-------------------------------

You may want to change the position of headers and footers. You can change the
horizontal position by doing the following:

- Center the header or footer between the left and right margins.

- Align it with the left or right margin.

- Run the header or footer text into the left or right margin.

The header and footer areas have two preset tab stops: centered between the
default left and right margins (3 inches), and right-aligned at the default
right margin (6 inches). These tab stops make it easy to center a chapter title
or place the page number flush with the right margin. If you change the margins,
you may want to adjust these tab stops.

To adjust the horizontal position of information inside a header or footer,
follow these steps:

1. On the View menu, click Header and Footer.

2. On the Header and Footer toolbar, click the Show Next and Show Previous
  buttons to find the header or footer that you want to adjust.

3. To position the header or footer, do one or more of the following:

   - To create left-aligned text in a header or footer, type the text. The
     starting position for the insertion point is left-aligned with the left
     margin of the document.

   - To create center-aligned text in a header or footer, press the TAB key
     once to advance the insertion point to the center-aligned tab and type the
     text. The text you type will be centered on the tab.

   - To create right-aligned text in a header or footer, press the TAB key one
     more time to advance the insertion point to the right-aligned tab and type
     the text.

   - To create a header or footer that runs into the left or right margins, you
     can set negative indents as follows:

     a. On the Format menu, click Paragraph.

     b. Click the Indents and Spacing tab.

     c. Type a negative number for the left and/or right indentation. For
        example, if you want the left-aligned text in the header to start 0.5
        inches into the left margin, type "-.5" (without the quotation marks)
        for the left indentation. A negative left indentation moves text into
        the left margin, and a negative right indentation moves text to the
        right, into the right margin.

   - To make additional adjustments to the alignment, use the alignment buttons
     on the Formatting toolbar, set different tab stops on the ruler, or drag
     the indent markers on the ruler.

You can change the vertical position by adjusting the header or footer starting
distance from the top or bottom edge of the page. You can also adjust the amount
of space between the header or footer and the text in the main document. To
perform these adjustments, follow these steps:

1. Position the insertion point in the specific area in the document that
  contains the header or footer that you want to adjust.

2. On the File menu, click Page Setup and then click the Margins tab.

   - To change the distance from the edge of page to the header or footer,
     change the From Edge setting. The default setting is 0.5 inch. Increasing
     the setting moves the entire header or footer closer to the center of the
     document. Decreasing the setting moves the entire header or footer closer
     to the edge of the page.

   - To change the distance between the document text and a header or footer,
     change the Top and Bottom margin settings. Increasing the top margin moves
     the document text farther down on the page and leaves the header in the
     same location. Decreasing the top margin moves the text of the document
     father up on the page and leaves the header in the same location. The same
     is true for the bottom margin and the footer.

3. To return to the document, click OK.

Different Types of Headers and Footers
--------------------------------------

First Page Headers and Footers::

To create a different header or footer for the first page of a document or
section, follow these steps:

1. Position the insertion point on the first page of the document or section,
  and then click Header and Footer on the View menu.

2. On the Header and Footer toolbar, click Page Setup.

3. Click the Layout tab.

4. Under Headers and footers, select the Different first page check box, and
  then click OK.

5. If necessary, click Show Next or Show Previous to move to the first page
  header or first page footer in the document or section. The words "First Page
  Header" or "First Page Footer" appear in the upper left of the dotted Header
  or Footer box.

6. Create the header or footer you want to appear on the first page. If you do
  not want a header or footer to appear on the first page, leave the header or
  footer area blank.

7. Click Show Next to move to the (non-first page) header or footer in the
  document or section. The word "Header" or "Footer" appears in the upper left
  of the dotted Header or Footer box.

8. Create the header or footer that you want to appear in the rest of the
  document or section. If you do not want a header or footer to appear in the
  rest of the document or section, leave the header or footer area blank.

9. To return to the document, click Close on the Header and Footer toolbar.

Odd and Even Headers and Footers::

To create different headers and footers on odd and even pages, follow these
steps:

1. On the View menu, click Header and Footer.

2. On the Header and Footer toolbar, click Page Setup.

3. Click the Layout tab.

4. Under Headers and footers, select the Different odd and even check box, and
  click OK. Word applies the option to the entire document.

5. If necessary, click Show Next or Show Previous to move to an even page header
  or footer. The words "Even Page Header" appear in the upper left of the
  dotted Header or Footer box.

6. Create the header or footer that you want to appear in the even pages of the
  document or section. If you do not want a header or footer to appear in the
  even pages of the document or section, leave the header or footer area blank.

7. Click Show Next or Show Previous to move to an odd header or footer. The
  words "Odd Page Header" appear in the upper left of the dotted Header or
  Footer box.

8. Create the header or footer that you want to appear in the odd pages of the
  document or section. If you do not want a header or footer to appear in the
  odd pages of the document or section, leave the header or footer area blank.

9. To return to the document, click Close on the Header and Footer toolbar.

even or odd pages in Microsoft Word, click the article number below to view the

  Q88404 WD: Setting Up Different First Header/Footer for Even/Odd Pages

Different Headers and Footers for Sections of a Document
--------------------------------------------------------

When you divide a document into sections, Word uses the headers and footers in
the first section as the default for every subsequent section. All headers in
the document and all footers in the document are initially connected so that
their contents are identical. If you change the header in the third section of
the document, for example, Word changes all headers in the entire document to
match. When headers and footers in the section that contains the insertion point
are connected to the previous section, the Same As Previous button on the Header
and Footer toolbar is pushed in, and the words "Same As Previous" appear in the
upper right of the dotted Header or Footer box.

If you want to create a different header or footer in one section, you must break
the connection with the preceding header or footer by clicking the Same As
Previous button on the Header and Footer toolbar. Word then uses the header or
footer you create in the current section for all subsequent sections. If you
decide that you want to re-establish the connection between the header or footer
in the current section and the preceding headers or footers, click the Same As
Previous button again. Word replaces the information contained in the current
header or footer with the information in the previous header or footer.

Headers and footers from one section are automatically connected to headers and
footers from the previous section until you click the Same As Previous button on
the Header and Footer toolbar to turn the setting off. For example, headers are
connected to only the type of header called Header; they are not connected to
the type of header called First Page Header. First Page Header is connected only
to First Page Header.

The following are the different types of connections between headers and footers
in a document:

- Headers are connected to Headers.

- Footers are connected to Footers.

- First Page Headers are connected to First Page Headers.

- First Page Footers are connected to First Page Footers.

- Odd Headers are connected to Odd Headers.

- Odd Footers are connected to Odd Footers.

- Even Headers are connected to Even Headers.

- Even Footers are connected to Even Footers.

To create a different header or footer for each section in a document, follow
these steps:

1. Position the insertion point in the section with the header or footer that
  you want to change (disconnect from the previous header or footer).

2. On the View menu, click Header and Footer.

3. Click Same As Previous on the Header and Footer toolbar to disconnect headers
  and footers in the current section from the previous section. The words "Same
  As Previous" disappear from the upper-right corner of the Header or Footer
  box.

4. Create the header and footer that you want for the current section.

  NOTE: Word also inserts the header and footer in all sections following the
  current one. To create a different header or footer in the following
  sections, repeat steps 3 through 4 in each section.

5. To return to the document, click Close on the Header and Footer toolbar.

To reconnect a header or footer with the preceding header or footer, follow these
steps:

1. Position the insertion point in the section with the header or footer that
  you want to connect to the preceding header or footer.

2. On the View menu, click Header and Footer.

3. On the Header and Footer toolbar, click Same As previous.

  NOTE: When Word asks you to confirm that you want to delete the current header
  or footer and connect to the preceding header or footer, click Yes. The
  preceding header or footer is repeated in the current section.

4. To return to the document, click Close on the Header and Footer toolbar.
