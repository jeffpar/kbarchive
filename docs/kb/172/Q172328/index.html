-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attach a data file to a mail merge main document, Microsoft Word may
stop responding when switching between Edit Data Source and Edit Main Document.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the data file contains too many merged columns, rows, and
cells.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, reformat the data file into a standard format: such
as a tab and comma delimited file, or a standard table or spreadsheet structure.

STATUS
======


Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Word 97 allows you to merge (or combine) adjacent and vertical table rows,
columns, or cells. By doing so, you can create a table that is too difficult for
Word to parse into the correct rows and columns. If this occurs, Word may stop
responding when working with the data file.

NOTE: Because the table drawing tool uses cell merging and splitting frequently
to create and format tables, it may create a table that is too difficult for
Word 97 to parse.


REFERENCES
==========

For more information about creating data files, click the Office Assistant, type
"creating a data file," click Search, and then click "Create a new mail merge
data source in Word."

For more information about merging and splitting cells, please see the following
articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Or, click the Office Assistant, type "merging table cells," click Search, and
then click "merge cells into one cell in a table"

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Word Help is not installed on your computer, please see the
