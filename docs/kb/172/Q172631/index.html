The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a custom numbering scheme in a Word document and then open that
document on another computer, the custom numbering scheme may not be available
in the Bullets and Numbering dialog box. When you click the Bullets or Numbering
buttons on the Formatting toolbar, the custom numbering scheme may not be
applied.

This problem occurs when the insertion point is in a paragraph that does not have
bullets or numbering applied.

CAUSE
=====

The gallery of custom bullets and numbering schemes (Bullets and Numbering
dialog box) are stored on the individual computer. Therefore, a custom scheme
created on one computer is unlikely to be available on another computer.

WORKAROUND
==========

The document with the custom numbering scheme contains enough information to
allow you to re-create the custom scheme on the second computer. To do this, use
either of the following methods.

Method 1: Use the Format Painter
--------------------------------

You can use the Format Painter to copy the numbering scheme from a numbered
paragraph to an unnumbered paragraph. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Select a correctly numbered paragraph.

2. Click the Format Painter button on the Standard toolbar.

  The mouse pointer should now look like an "I-beam" with a paintbrush attached
  to it.

3. Select the paragraphs you want to number. Once you release the mouse button,
  Word applies custom numbering to the selected paragraphs.

Method 2: Update the Numbering Gallery on the Second Computer
-------------------------------------------------------------

You can update the numbering gallery on the second computer to include the custom
numbering scheme used in the document. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Position the insertion point in one of the correctly numbered paragraphs.

2. On the Formatting toolbar, click the Numbering button to turn off the
  numbering for that paragraph.

3. On the Formatting toolbar, click the Numbering button again to turn on the
  numbering again for that paragraph.

The custom numbering scheme will now be available in the numbering gallery. To
use this scheme, follow these steps:

1. Position the insertion point on the paragraph you want to number.

2. On the Format menu, click Bullets and Numbering.

3. In the Bullets and Numbering dialog box, click the appropriate tab, and then
  click the custom scheme you want to use.

From this point on, in this document, the Numbering button on the Formatting
toolbar will use the custom scheme you selected in the gallery.
