  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

With the release of the 128-bit Service Pack 3 (SP3) for Windows NT 4.0, RAS
clients can now negotiate 128-bit RAS data encryption with a Windows NT 4.0 RAS
server. Normal RAS data encryption is 40-bit. RAS clients that can take
advantage of 128-bit data encryption are Windows NT Server or Workstation 4.0
with SP3 128-bit and Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking 1.2 128- bit.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To enable 128-bit RAS data encryption on an NT 4.0 SP3 128-bit RAS server, use
the following steps:

1. in Control Panel, double-click Network , and then click Services.

2. Click Remote Access Service, and tjem click Properties.

3. Click Network, and then click "Require Microsoft encrypted authentication".

4. Click "Require data encryption", and then click OK.

5. Click Continue, and then click Close.

6. Click No when you receive a prompt to restart the computer.

7. Start Registry Editor (Regedit.exe or Regedt32.exe).

8. Navigate to the following registry subtree:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RasMan\PPP\COMPCP

9. Click Edit, click Add Value, and then enter the following information:

  Value Name: "ForceStrongEncryption" (without the quotation marks)
  Value Type: "DWORD" (without the quotation marks)
  Value Data: "1" (without the quotation marks)

10. Exit Registry Editor, and then restart the computer.

With 128-bit RAS encryption enabled, you will see one or more event log messages
in Event Viewer when RAS users connect using RAS or PPTP. If the RAS client
supports 128-bit RAS data encryption, the computer may log the following event:

  Event ID: 20107
  Source: RemoteAccess
  Description: The user RAS connected to port COM1 using strong encryption.

If the RAS client does not support 128-bit RAS data encryption, the computer may
log the following event:

  Event ID: 20077
  Source: RemoteAccess
  Description: An error occurred in the Point to Point Protocol module on port
  COM1. The remote computer does not support the required encryption type.

A Windows 95 client that fails with the above event log may receive the following
error message:

  Dial-Up Networking
  Error 629: You have been disconnected from the computer you dialed.
  Double-click the connection to try again.

A Windows NT client that fails with the above event log may receive the following
error message:

  Error Connecting to RAS server
  Disconnected.
  Error 629: The port was disconnected by the remote machine.
