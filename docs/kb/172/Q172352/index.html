- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

After you download a Windows 95 PostScript driver from a server running Windows
NT through point and print, printing options for the printer may not match what
the printer should have.

Another symptom is that 600 dpi resolution printers are only printing at 300 dpi
resolution.

Windows 95 printer driver details may show that the wrong PPD is in use. The
wrong driver in use is Apple380.ppd.

If the printer driver is loaded without the use of point and print (the printer
driver is loaded by means of a compact disc, disks, or a share point), the
proper PPD file is used.

CAUSE
=====

When Windows 95 downloads a PostScript printer driver from the server running
Windows NT, it parses the .spd file for the printer capabilities and creates a
.ppd from the .spd. Under certain conditions, the parse determines that a
default .ppd must be used instead. That default .ppd is the Apple380.ppd.

Differences between the Windows NT Ntprint.inf and the Windows 95 Printer.inf
files can also cause this symptom to occur.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods below:

Method 1
--------

Load the printer driver without the use of point and print. If the driver needs
to be distributed to many workstations, place all of the necessary files in a
shared network directory.

For more information about how to remove the Windows 95 driver from the Windows
NT print server, please see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q162258 How to Remove Cross-Platform Printer Drivers on Windows NT

Method 2
--------

Use the following steps to install the PostScript driver on the server running
Windows NT:

1. In Explorer, navigate to the %SystemRoot%\INF folder, and then copy the
  Ntprint.inf file to another location or name.

  NOTE: The INF directory is hidden by default.

2. Edit the Ntprint.inf file in Notepad and remove everything between the
  printer name and the last quote. For example:

     original line: "QMS-PS 2200 v51.0 or 52.3" = Q2200523.PPD
     change to:     "QMS-PS 2200 "              = Q2200523.PPD

3. Install the printer on the server running Windows NT 4.0 and share it with
  Windows 95 alternate drivers.

4. Connect to the printer from the Windows 95 client.

After the printer is installed, right-click the printer properties and verify
that the correct driver is associated with the printer.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.


MORE INFORMATION
================

During the installation of the networked printer, the Windows 95 workstation is
provided information on the files that should be copied for the printer being
connected to, and then the file copy takes place. Next, the Windows 95
workstation finds the driver name installed by the host computer, in this case
the server running Windows NT 4.0, and tries to match the driver to install.
Because the Windows NT host driver name is in the form of &lt;printer&gt; &lt;ps
version&gt; and Windows 95 sometimes only uses &lt;printer&gt;, there may not be
an exact match and it will default to the generic postscript driver
(Apple380.spd).
