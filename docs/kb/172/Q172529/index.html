The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the
registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

Administrators can use System Policies to lock down a Windows NT 4.0 system to a
great degree. This ability can include denying users access to Control Panel.
However, in taking away access to Control Panel, users can no longer use Add
Printer to install or connect to a printer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is a work around allowing users to access the Printers icon part
of Control Panel.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

NOTE: The changes outlined in this article apply to all users of any workstation
or server that is modified.

1. Log on to Windows NT as the administrator.

2. Run Regedt32.exe.

3. Go to the following registry key:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer

  Under RemoteComputer\NameSpace, there will be a key with a CLSID of
  {2227A280-3AEA-1069-A2DE-08002B30309D}. The value of the key is &lt;No
  Name&gt;:REG_SZ:Printers.

4. Create an exact copy of this key and value in either of the two following
  places:

     HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion
     \Explorer\Desktop\Namespace

  OR

     HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion
     \Explorer\MyComputer\NameSpace

  NOTE: The above registry keys are each one path; they have been wrapped for
  readability.

  To add this key and value, perform the following steps:

  a. Select NameSpace in Regedt32.

  b. On the Edit menu, click Add Key.

  c. For Key Name, type {2227A280-3AEA-1069-A2DE-08002B30309D} and leave Class
     blank.

  d. Select the key you just created and, on the Edit menu, click Add Value.

  e. Leave Value Name blank. In the Data Type list, click REG_SZ. Click OK.

  f. In the string editor, type Printers.

5. After the CLSID is copied with the appropriate value, all users logging on to
  this computer will have access to the Printer Control Panel.

If placed in Desktop\Namespace, the Printer icon will always be on the desktop of
all users, and hidden only if all items on the desktop are hidden with System
Policies. If placed in MyComputer\Namespace, the Printer icon will always be in
My Computer and Explorer.
