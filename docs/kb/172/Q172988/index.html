SUMMARY
=======

This article shows you how to programmatically retrieve the class names and
members of a dll or ActiveX file that contains a type library. You can get this
information by using the Object Browser in Visual Basic or you can
programmatically retrieve this information. The sample program uses an
unsupported file Tlbinf32.dll to retrieve some of the type library information,
but is not a complete substitute for the Object Browser.

NOTE: The file Tlbinf32.dll is not supported by Microsoft Technical Support
either electronically or via telephone. This file is subject to change without
notice.

A Visual Basic project that demonstrates how to use this file to get the class
names and members from a dll or ActiveX controls is available for download from
the Microsoft Download Center: The following file is available for download from
the Microsoft Download Center:

  Clsnmmbr.exe

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Object Browser in Visual Basic shows you the collections and member names of
a dll class. You may want to develop an add-in for use in other development
environments that has the same functionality as the object browser and to add
some automation capabilities. This sample shows you how to retrieve this
information programmatically by using the file tlbinf32.dll. This file is stored
in the OS\System directory of your installation disk and is copied to your
computer's system folder during the Visual Basic installation.

After downloading and running the self-extracting file, the following files are
extracted to your hard drive:

- From1.frm (4K)

- Form1.frx (1K)

- Project1.vbp (1K)

- Project1.vbw (1K)

- Readme.txt

When you run the project in Visual Basic by pressing the F5 key, click the Choose
file button to select a dll or ActiveX file. If the file contains a type
library, the class names and members are displayed in the list box.

You can duplicate this project by completing the steps shown in the following
section.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Start Visual Basic and chose Standard Exe or, if Visual Basic is already
  running, choose New Project from the File menu.

2. Set a reference to the file Tlbinf32.dll by completing the following steps:

  a. From the Project menu, click References. The References dialog box is
     displayed.

  b. From the References dialog box, click Browse.

  c. From your Windows system directory, select the file Tlbinf32.dll.

3. Add the following controls to the Form1 form and set the indicated
  properties:
