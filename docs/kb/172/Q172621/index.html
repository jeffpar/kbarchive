The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Routing and Remote Access Service Update for Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Your computer running both Windows NT 4.0 Server and the Routing and Remote
Access Service (RRAS) may receive numerous Event Log messages similar to the
following:

  Event ID: 30030
  Source: IPRIP2
  Type: Warning
  Description: IPRIPv2 is ignoring a route to the broadcast network
  255.255.255.255 with the next hop &lt;IP address&gt; which was advertised by
  a neighbor with IP the address &lt;IP address&gt;.

where &lt;IP address&gt; is the IP address of a neighboring router.

CAUSE
=====

Your RRAS server is receiving Routing Information Protocol (RIP) broadcasts from
one or more adjacent routers that do not belong to the same IP network. If the
IP network ID is not the same, the route being broadcast is considered invalid.
The route is ignored and a warning event will be logged in the Event Viewer
System Log.

RESOLUTION
==========

This behavior does not present a problem other than the numerous messages in
Event Viewer. To prevent the warning from appearing in Event Viewer, you may use
one of the following methods:

- Set event logging for RRAS to Log errors only:

  1. In RRAS Admin, right-click RIP for Internet Protocol and click Configure
     RIP.

  2. Click either Log errors only or Disable event-logging.

  3. Click OK and stop and restart RRAS.

  -or-

- Configure RRAS to ignore RIP announcements from the neighboring router:

  1. In RRAS Admin, right-click RIP for Internet Protocol and click Configure
     RIP.

  2. Click Security and click Discard all announcements from the routers
     listed.

  3. Type the IP address of the neighboring router in the Router box and click
     Add.

  4. Click OK and stop and restart RRAS.

  -or-

- Configure RRAS to only accept announcements from specific routers:

  1. In RRAS Admin, right-click RIP for Internet Protocol and click Configure
     RIP.

  2. Click Security and click Process only announcements from the routers
     listed.

  3. Type the IP address of a router that is on the same network ID as your
     RRAS server and click Add.

     NOTE: Repeat step 3 for each of the RRAS servers that you need in this
     list.

  4. Click OK and stop and restart RRAS.
