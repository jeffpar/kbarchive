SUMMARY
=======

To help you minimize the amount of time you spend on the phone with technical
support, here are several steps which you can take on your own before calling
technical support. Following them may reduce the amount of time it takes for an
engineer to solve your problem.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before you begin, think back. Has the program run before? If so, what has
changed? What has been added? These changes may include installing or removing
new software, adding new hardware (like a sound card or a modem), or installing
additional memory.

Restart the Computer
--------------------

Many times, files or programs in your computer's memory may be causing a
conflict. Restarting the computer can often rectify this.

Clean the CD-ROM
----------------

To clean the CD-ROM for the program, use a CD-ROM cleaning kit, or gently wipe
the silver side of the CD-ROM with a soft, lint-free cotton cloth. Do not use
paper cloth which can scratch the plastic and leave streaks. When you clean the
CD-ROM, wipe from the center of the disc outward; do not use a circular motion.

Remove and Reinstall the Program
--------------------------------

In most cases, the setup program has a Remove All button which removes all of the
program files, but does not remove any files (such as documents or saved games)
that you created on the hard drive. Use this Remove All option to remove the
program completely, and then reinstall the program. Refer to the Read Me file
for more information on this feature.

Check The Online Help File for the Program
------------------------------------------

There is generally either a help menu in the program (you may also try pressing
the F1 key while in the program) or a help file on the CD-ROM or disk set that
you installed the product from. You may also check in the folder where the
program was installed or in the program group on the Start menu.

Check the Read Me File for the Program
--------------------------------------

This is usually located on the installation CD-ROM or disk set, but may also be
installed into the program folder of the software. Click Start, point to
Programs, and then point to the program on this list. You may see a Read Me item
here. Also, double check the Minimum System Requirements on the product box. For
Microsoft products, these are generally listed on the back of the box on the
right hand side.

Check the Support Site for the Program
--------------------------------------

To find additional support information, connect to the following Microsoft Web
site:

  http://support.microsoft.com

This site lists support options that are available to you, such as complete
support site searches, Frequently Asked Questions, Troubleshooters, and links to
Newsgroups where Microsoft Valued Professionals (MVP's) and other customers, who
may have encountered the same problem that you are experiencing, may assist you.
You may also access the same articles that Microsoft support professionals use
when you call.

Obtain and Install Updated Sound and Video Drivers
--------------------------------------------------

To obtain and install the latest versions of the sound and video drivers for your
sound card and video adapter, please visit the Windows Update Web site at the
following address:

  http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com

Test Under Different Situations
-------------------------------

Is this problem consistently reproducible on your machine? Have you tried to run
the program on another computer? Sometimes, the computer store from which you
purchased the software may allow you to install the program on one of their
computers for testing. (To save time, call the store before you take the
software in for testing.) If you suspect you have a faulty CD- ROM, ask for a
replacement disc.

Quit All Programs that Are Running
----------------------------------

If you are using Windows 95/98, you may hold down the Ctrl and Alt keys and then
press the Delete key (use Task Manager on Windows NT). This brings up the Close
Program window which lists all of the programs that are running. For Windows 95
and Windows 98, the only necessary items are Explorer and Systray. Please note,
however, that the program that you are having trouble with may have installed
another item that needs to run and the program may not run if you close this
item.

Printing from a Different Program
---------------------------------

If the problem involves printing, try printing from another program, such as
Windows WordPad or Macintosh SimpleText. If the item you wish to print includes
images, WordPad supports this feature.

Change Your Display Settings
----------------------------

Try changing your display driver to run in a different display size or number of
colors. To change this on a Windows 95-based computer:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Display, and then click the Settings tab.

3. Move the Desktop Area or Screen Area slider all the way to the left (the 640
  x 480 Pixels setting).

4. In the Colors or Color Palette box, click 256 Colors, and then click OK.

5. If you are prompted to restart the computer, do so.

To change the display settings on a Macintosh, use the Monitors or Monitors And
Sound control panel.

Also, some video cards support the Super VGA display driver. Check with your
hardware manufacturer to determine if yours is one of them.

Note When You Receive the Error Message
---------------------------------------

Write down the exact text of any error messages you receive, and note when you
receive these messages. Do you receive the error message when you start the
program or when you click a particular button or menu? This information can help
our support professionals find a speedy resolution to your issue, should you
need to call.

Check Hardware Device
---------------------

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Shut down your computer.

2. Unplug the device.

3. Plug the device back in securely.

4. Restart your computer.
