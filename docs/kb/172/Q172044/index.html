-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SYMPTOMS
========

WordMail Options will not be available on the Compose menu of Microsoft Exchange
Client 4.0 or 5.0 if you install Microsoft Word 97 or Microsoft Office 97 using
the Run From Network Server option.


WORKAROUND
==========

Use one of the following workarounds to solve the problem.

Method 1: Start Exchange from the Office Shortcut Bar
-----------------------------------------------------

If you start Microsoft Exchange from the Office Shortcut Bar, WordMail Options
will be available on the Compose menu in Microsoft Exchange.

If you start Microsoft Exchange from the desktop icon or by clicking the Start
button on the Windows taskbar, pointing to Programs, and clicking Microsoft
Exchange, WordMail Options will not be available on the Compose menu in
Microsoft Exchange.

To add Microsoft Exchange to the Office Shortcut Bar, follow these steps:

1. Right-click the Office Logo icon on the top left of the Office Shortcut Bar
  and click Customize on the shortcut menu.

2. Click the Toolbars tab.

3. Click to select Programs and then click OK.

You will now have a second toolbar on the Office Shortcut Bar with a Microsoft
Exchange icon.

Method 2: Change the Stationery value from a UNC path to a drive letter
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And Values
online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should make a
backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you edit the
registry.

To change the stationery value from a UNC path to a drive letter, follow these
steps:

1. On the Windows Start menu, click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks), and then click
  OK.

3. Locate the following registry key:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Exchange\Client\Extensions

4. In the right pane, with Stationery selected, on the Edit menu click Modify.

5. In the Value Data box, type a drive letter to replace the UNC path. For
  example, if the path says

     4.0;\\server\share\Office97\Server\Office\station.dll;1

  Change it to a drive letter, such as E:\. It would look like this:

     4.0;E:\Office97\Server\Office\station.dll;1

6. Exit the Registry Editor and map the drive to this location by following
  these steps:

  a. Right-click the network neighborhood icon on your desktop, and click Map
     Network Drive.

  b. Click the drive letter you chose in step 8.

  c. Type the location indicated in step 8. In this example, type
     "\\server\share" (without the quotation marks) and click OK.

  NOTE: For this method to work, you must keep the same network drive letter
  mapped to the location indicated in step 8. One way to accomplish this
  automatically is to use a drive letter that would normally be unused (such as
  "W") and click to select the Reconnect At Logon option in step C.

When you exit and restart Microsoft Exchange, WordMail Options will be on the
Compose menu.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Once you install Microsoft Word 97 or Microsoft Office 97, you will be able to
use Microsoft Word as your e-mail editor. The ability to control the e- mail
template you want to use and to turn WordMail on or off, is done by clicking the
Compose menu in Microsoft Exchange, and clicking WordMail Options. If the menu
option is unavailable, you will be unable to change these options.

NOTE: This problem does not occur if you use Microsoft Outlook 97 as your e-mail
client. Microsoft Outlook 97 shipped with Microsoft Word 97 and Microsoft Office
97.

This problem does not occur if you run any other type of setup. It only occurs
when performing a Run From Network Server installation.
