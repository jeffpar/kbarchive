-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Personal Computer Properties only displays the Identification and Network
Monitor groups for some Macintosh clients.

CAUSE
=====

INVMAC fails to perform resynchronization (resync).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do any one of the following:

- Delete the Macintoshes' history file, found on the Systems Management Server
  site server, along with its reference in the History.map file.

- Obtain the hotfix mentioned in the STATUS section below. This fix should have
  the following timestamp:

     11/6/97  7:15pm               162,753 Invmac.mac

- Wait for and apply Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 4.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression- tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.


MORE INFORMATION
================

If you choose to work around this problem by obtaining the hotfix, be aware that
the Invmac.mac file is compressed, so you must use Hdecomp.exe (found in the
Support directory of the Systems Management Server 1.2 CD) to expand it. Expand
the file to a user authentication module (UAM) volume, and place it in the
Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\Mac.bin directory of each site server. Macintosh
clients must run the Systems Management Server Installer script to get the
updated Invmac.mac file.
