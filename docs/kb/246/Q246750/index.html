-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you download the offline Address Book (OAB), the "Always send to this
recipient in Microsoft Exchange rich text format" check box is cleared in any
custom recipient mailboxes that were created by using the Exchange Server
Administrator program.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. The "Allow rich text in messages" check box under
"Custom recipient options" in the Exchange Server Administrator program is an
attribute that is not downloaded in the offline Address Book for any custom
recipient mailboxes.

WORKAROUND
==========

Create a personal address book (PAB) entry for the specific custom recipient and
click to select the "Always send to this recipient in Microsoft Exchange rich
text format" check box, or select the custom recipient from the global address
list when you are working online.

For additional information about the attributes that are downloaded in the
offline Address Book, click the article number below to view the article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q180118 XADM: Information Available in the Offline Address Book

MORE INFORMATION
================

Most Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) and Internet Message Access Protocol,
Version 4rev1 (IMAP4) clients do not read the Rich Text Format (RTF) that is
used by Microsoft Transport-Neutral Encapsulation Format (TNEF). Consequently,
the sender must click to clear the "Always send to this recipient as RTF" check
box for a POP3 or IMAP4 client to see attachments.

the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
