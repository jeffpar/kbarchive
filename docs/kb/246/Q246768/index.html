SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to manage information in a public folder in which Team Folders has
been installed, you may receive one or both of the following error messages:

  VBScript: Team Folders: 424: There has been an error creating an object on
  this page.

  Error code 1200: The Outlook permissions control didn't initialize properly.
  Please contact your administrator to ensure that your browser can install
  ActiveX controls and that the controls are available via either the Internet
  or your intranet.

CAUSE
=====

This issue generally occurs if clients that try to use Team Folders do not have
access to the Internet. Unless the Codebase.inf file in the Tfkit folder is
modified to point to an internal network shared drive, users are unable to
download and install the ActiveX controls that are necessary to view and
administer Team Folders.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

1. Copy the following files from the folder that is created by the Team Folders
  Kit Setup to a shared folder on your network:

   - Oltfwiz.exe

   - Oltfacl.cab

   - Outlctlx.cab

   - Codebase.bat

   - Codebase.inf

2. Use a text editor such as Notepad to open the Codebase.inf file in the shared
  folder, and then change the string that follows ControlsURL= to the URL of
  the shared folder. For example, if you placed these files in a shared folder
  named Downloads on a Web server named Toolsrvr, you would change the
  statement to the following:

  ControlsURL="http://toolsrvr/downloads/"

3. Instruct users who you want to be able to create Team Folders projects about
  how to run the Codebase.bat file from the shared location. For example, you
  can send interested users e-mail that contains a shortcut to the shared file.
  When users run the Codebase.bat file, it installs the Team Folders Wizard and
  configures the wizard to create folder home pages that load their controls
  from your intranet location. To run Team Folders Wizard Setup so that it does
  not require intervention by the end user, edit the Codebase.bat file and
  replace "Oltfwiz.exe" with "Oltfwiz.exe /q."

MORE INFORMATION
================

For additional information about how to deploy Team Folders, see the Team
Folders Kit documentation that is installed when you run the Oltfkit.exe
program.
