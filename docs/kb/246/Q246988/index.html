SYMPTOMS
========

A host computer may lose the connection to one of its gateways.

CAUSE
=====

If a computer that is configured to use Internet Router Discovery Protocol
(IRDP) temporarily stops receiving router advertisements from a gateway
interface and the default gateway detection routine discovers that the interface
is invalid, the route to that gateway interface is deleted from the route table
on the computer. If the gateway becomes valid again and starts sending IRDP
updates to the computer, the route is not added again.
