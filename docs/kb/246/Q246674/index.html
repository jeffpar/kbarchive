-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Link monitors are message-based and are used to verify the efficient routing of
test messages. The test messages are called ping messages and are sent every
polling interval; a ping message is sent to every server chosen. This article
explains the various options available in configuring a link monitor.

NOTE: If a target custom recipient matches the link monitor's requested
nonexistent custom recipient, the link monitor doesn't receive an NDR and
reports that the link is unavailable.

For additional, detailed information please see the Microsoft Exchange Books
Online.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Link Monitor Configuration
--------------------------

To configure link monitor:

1. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, click Monitors.

2. On the File menu, click New Other, and then click Link Monitor.

General Properties Dialog Box
-----------------------------

Use the General Properties dialog box to define a directory name and a display
name, create log files, and set polling intervals.

- Directory name: A maximum of 64 alphanumeric characters, which can include
  spaces and special characters. If no name is provided, the system prompts for
  a value. The name cannot be changed.

- Display name: A maximum of 256 alphanumeric characters. The syntax of this
  field is Unicode, which understands all languages and their special
  characters. If no name is provided, the system prompts for a value. The name
  can be modified at any time.

- Creating Log Files: Type or click the directory and file name for the log
  file, and then click Save. If no directory and file name are specified, a log
  file is not created.

- Setting Polling Intervals: Use polling intervals to indicate how often the
  link monitor sends ping messages to check connections.

   - Normal: Indicate how often to send a ping message. The default is 15
     minutes.

   - Critical sites: Indicate how often to send a ping message to servers or
     systems that are in a warning or alert state. The default is 5 minutes.

Permissions Property Page
-------------------------

Use the Permissions property page to indicate which Microsoft Windows NT accounts
can modify the specified monitor. Permissions are necessary when a connection is
being modified but are not necessary to start a link monitor.

NOTE: By default, the Permissions property page is hidden. To view it, click
Options from the Tools menu.

Notification Property Page
--------------------------

Use the Notification property page to specify how to notify administrators when a
connection is in a warning state or an alert state. Notifications can be
delivered as pager programs, mail messages, or network alerts. Notifications are
also sent when connections are restored.

How to Configure to Start a Process:

1. Click New; a New Notification dialog box opens.

2. Click Launch a Process, and then click OK.

3. In the Time delay box, type the amount of time after entering an alert state
  that you want the notification process to begin. Click either Seconds,
  Minutes, or Hours.

4. Click File to browse for a process to start.

5. In the Command line parameters box, type any command parameters.

6. Click Test to verify that the process is correct.

How to Configure Mail Messages:

1. Click New; a New Notification dialog box opens.

2. Click Mail Message, and then click OK.

3. In the Time delay box, type the amount of time after entering an alert state
  that you want the notification process to begin. Click Seconds, Minutes, or
  Hours.

4. Click to select the Alert Only check box to send notification only if the
  monitor is in an alert state. Click to clear the Alert Only check box to send
  notification in both the warning and alert states.

5. Click Recipient if you want to choose a name from a list of recipients. This
  recipient will receive an e-mail notification of an alert. The recipient's
  name appears in the Mailbox to notify field.

6. Click Test to verify that the process is correct.

How to Configure Network Alerts:

1. Click New; a New Notification dialog box opens.

2. Click Windows NT Alert, and then click OK.

3. In the Escalation Editor dialog box, type the amount of time after entering
  an alert state that you want the notification process to begin. Click
  Seconds, Minutes, or Hours.

4. Click to select the Alert Only check box to send notification only if the
  monitor is in an alert state. Click to clear the Alert Only check box to send
  notification in both the warning and alert states.

5. In the Computer to Alert field, type the NetBIOS name of the computer to
  receive the alert message.

6. Click Test to verify that the process is correct.

Servers Property Page
---------------------

Link monitoring within an organization uses the Servers property page to specify
which servers should receive ping messages from your Exchange Server computer.
The servers must be in your organization but can be in different sites.

Choosing Servers to Monitor:

1. In the Servers box, click a server you want to monitor.

Click Add, to add the selected server to the list of monitored servers.

Removing Servers from the List:

If you no longer need to monitor a server, you can remove it from the list:

1. Click the Servers tab.

2. In the Monitored Servers box, click a server, and then click Remove.

Recipients Property Page
------------------------

To monitor outside of an organization, use the Recipients property page to
configure a link monitor that checks connections to other organizations or
foreign systems (such as Lotus Notes, Novell GroupWise, SendMail). The link
monitor checks for replies. When you test a connection using a link monitor,
specify a recipient that does not exist so you will be sent a non-delivery
report (NDR) message. When an NDR is returned, it signifies that the link is
working correctly.

NOTE: The NDR does not contain the name of the recipient that sent it, so the NDR
may be sent from a system anywhere along the connection path.

Message Subject Returned from Option :

You can specify a recipient that responds with the original subject in the
subject line. Using the "Message subject returned from" option saves time
because the body of the message does not need to be opened.

1. Under Message subject returned from, click Modify.

2. Click the names of the recipients, and then click Add.

Message Subject or Body Returned from Option:

You can specify a recipient that responds with the original subject in either the
subject line or the message body. Use the "Message subject or body returned
from" option if you don't know whether the recipient returns the subject in the
subject line or in the message body.

1. Under "Message subject or body returned from", click Modify.

2. Click the names of the recipients, and then click Add.

Bounce Property Page
--------------------

Use the Bounce property page to set the warning and alert durations for each link
monitor. One set of durations is used for all recipients and servers. A bounce
duration is the longest acceptable round-trip time for a message to travel
between the monitor's home server and another server or foreign system. You
determine the value based on tests you have performed previously. An alert state
indicates a more serious connection problem than a warning state.

Bounce Message Return Time  :

In the Enter warning state after box, type a number, and then click Seconds,
Minutes, or Hours. The default is 30 minutes.

Specifying an Alert State Duration:

An alert state duration is the length of time after which the returned ping
message should be considered very late. In the Enter alert state after box, type
a number, and then click Seconds, Minutes, or Hours. The default is 60 minutes.
