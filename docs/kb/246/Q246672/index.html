The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a user has not been added to the AS400 System Distribution Directory, the
following error message occurs on the SNA Server computer when trying to browse
to the folders on the AS400 system:

  No Folders found in &lt;AS400 system name&gt;.

CAUSE
=====

The AS400 User ID that is used for the SNA Server Shared Folders definition must
be added to the AS400 System Distribution Directory when you set up the SNA
Server Shared Folders.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure that the AS400 is configured correctly and that the account &lt;AS400
User ID&gt; has permissions to access shared folders on &lt;AS400 system
name&gt;.

To add the AS400 User ID to the System Distribution Directory, do the following:

1. Log on to the AS400 system as a security administrator or security officer.

2. On the AS400 command line, type the following, and then press the ENTER key:

  WRKDIRE

3. When the "Work with Directory Entries" screen appears, on the "Opt" line,
  type "1" (Add). In the "User ID" field, type the AS400 User ID, and in the
  "Address" field, type the address. Press the ENTER key.

4. When the "Add Directory Entry" screen appears (this is the basic information
  required to add the User ID to the System Distribution Directory), press the
  ENTER key.

NOTE: The "ADDDIRE" command can also be used on the AS400 system to accomplish
the same task in a similar way. Additional steps may be needed for this. For
further information on that procedure, refer to the AS400 online Help or IBM
documentation on System Distribution Directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Please refer to the AS400 Help or IBM documentation for a description on each
field of entry. To view the AS400 online Help for the appropriate field, press
the F1 (or CMD1) key while the cursor is positioned in the field where you need
help.

For more information about other useful IBM documentation, see the Publications
Reference, SC41-4003 book.
