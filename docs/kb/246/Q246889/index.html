-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article lists the article numbers for Exchange Server version 5.5 Internet
Mail Service bugs that have been fixed since Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3
was released. For information about how to obtain the fixes listed in this
article, click the article number next to the title of the article about that
issue to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

NOTE: Exchange Server fixes for a particular component are cumulative and contain
all of the previous fixes for that component. Fixes with a particular version
number contain all of the fixes that have an earlier version number.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Internet Mail Service fixes include the following files:

+--------------------------------+
| File name    | Current version | 
+--------------------------------+
| Imcmsg.dll   | 5.5.2652.53     | 
+--------------------------------+
| Msexcimc.exe | 5.5.2652.78     | 
+--------------------------------+

NOTE: The fix documented in Q243822, "XCON: Internet Mail Service Message Size
Restriction Is Not Correctly Displayed," requires an updated Imcadmin.dll file
in addition to the updated Msexcimc.exe file. This updated Imcadmin.dll file is
contained in new versions of the Administrator program, not the Internet Mail
Service. Therefore, to fully resolve the problem documented in Q243822, you must
obtain a new version of the Administrator program in addition to obtaining a new
version of the Internet Mail Service.
