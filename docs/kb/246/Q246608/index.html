The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Exchange Server message transfer agent (MTA) may generate a Dr. Watson event
with the following error message:

  An application error has occurred and an application error log is being
  generated.
  emsmta.exe
  Exception: access violation (0xc0000005), Address: 0x0041cb74

At the same time, the MTA generates a 9405 event in the application event log as
follows:

  Event ID: 9405 Source: MSExchangeMTA
  Type: Error Category: Field Engineering
  Description: An unexpected error has occurred which may cause the MTA to
  terminate. Error: Access violation (0xc0000005) at Address 0x41cb74 reading
  from 0x4. [BASE TRANSFER 16] (16)

Further examination of the User.dmp file reveals the following call stack:

0471fea4  00426fb3  00000000 00920006 00000000 EMSMTA!&lt;B&gt;MtaQueueAdd&lt;/B&gt;+0x51({...})

At this point, the MTA will not start until the problem is resolved.

CAUSE
=====

The access violation occurs when the MTA is trying to build an X.400 application
programming interface (XAPI) transfer queue to an Exchange Server computer that
no longer exists within the site.

RESOLUTION
==========

The problem may be prevented by removing all references to the problem XAPI
connector (that is, Internet Mail Service, cc:Mail, Notes, GroupWise, SNADS,
OV/VM, Fax, Pager, and so on). Specifically, use the Delete Raw Object option to
remove the problem XAPI connector from the Connections container, and then
recalculate routing.

WARNING: Using the raw mode of the Exchange Server Administrator program (admin
/r) incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall
Microsoft Windows NT Server and/or Microsoft Exchange Server. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of raw mode can be
solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.

1. Start the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program in raw mode by
  typing the following at a command prompt:

  "c:\exchsrvr\bin\admin /r" (without the quotation marks)

2. Click the problem XAPI connector in the Connections container, and then on
  the Edit menu, click Delete RAW Object.

3. You receive the following message:

  The selected object and all objects below it will be deleted from the
  directory service. Deletions will take effect immediately and will replicate
  to other servers. Are you sure you want to proceed?

4. Click OK, and then click YES.

5. You may also see the following warning:

  Extension 'SMTP' could not be loaded.

  If you do, click Ignore. The connector should now be removed.

You must now recalculate the routing table:

1. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, click to expand the Site
  object, click Configuration, and double-click the Site Addressing object to
  open its properties.

2. Click the Routing tab, and then click the Recalculate Routing button. A
  message appears that states:

  It will take several minutes for the new routing information to be replicated
  across your site and then take effect.

3. Check each server's routing table in the site, and make sure that this route
  gets removed.

4. After the route is removed from the entire site, you may restart the MTA on
  the Exchange Server computer that had the access violation.
