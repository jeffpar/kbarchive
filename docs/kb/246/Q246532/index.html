-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install the Gateway Service for NetWare (GSNW) service on a
computer running Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 with Lotus Domino Notes Server,
the installation may appear to be successful. However, after you then restart
the computer, the Logon To Preferred Server option may not appear and Control
Panel may not display the GSNW icon.

Also, the Services utility may show that GSNW is present and set to Automatic,
but the service may not be running. Event Viewer may record the following
event:

  Event ID 7001: The System Can Not Find the File Specified.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because of a conflict between GSNW and Lotus Domino
Notes Server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, remove and then reinstall the GSNW service and the NWLink
Internetwork Packet Exchange/Sequenced Packet Exchange (IPX/SPX) protocol.
Follow these steps:

1. Remove GSNW and NWLink IPX/SPX:

  a. In Control Panel, double-click Network.

  b. On the Services tab, click Gateway (and Client) Services For NetWare,
     click Remove, and then click Yes.

  c. On the Protocols tab, click NWLink IPX/SPX Compatible Transport, click
     Remove, and then click Yes.

  d. Restart the computer.

2. Quit the Lotus Domino Notes Server program.

3. Reinstall NWLink IPX/SPX:

  a. In Control Panel, double-click Network.

  b. On the Protocols tab, click Add, click NWLink IPX/SPX Compatible Transport
     in the Network Protocols box, and then click OK.

  c. Insert the Windows NT Server 4.0 CD, or type the path to the location of
     the setup files, and then click Continue.

  d. Click OK.

  e. Configure NWLink IPX/SPX Compatible Transport:

     CAUTION: To prevent data loss, save all work and quit all programs before
     you proceed.

     1. To accept the default configuration for the protocol, click Close, and
        then click Yes to restart the computer and enable the new settings.

     2. To configure the protocol manually:

        a. In the Network Protocols box, double-click NWLink IPX/SPX Compatible
           Transport.

        b. In the Adapter box, click the name of the network adapter to which
           you want to bind the protocol.

        c. In the Frame Type and Network Number boxes, specify this
           information.

        d. (Optional) On the Routing tab, click Enable RIP Routing.

           NOTE: To enable Routing Information Protocol (RIP) routing, you must
           have more than one network adapter running IPX/SPX and you must
           install RIP for NWLink, under Network Services.

        e. Click OK, and then click Close.

           CAUTION: To prevent data loss, save all work and close all programs
           before you proceed.

        f. Click Yes to restart the computer and enable the new settings.

4. Quit the Lotus Notes Domino Server program if it starts when you restart the
  computer.

5. Reinstall GSNW:

  NOTE: You must have at least one account on the NetWare server so you can use
  the Windows NT Server 4.0-based computer to log on as a user with
  administrative privileges. Create a second NetWare account, NTGATEWAY, for
  the gateway and remove existing NetWare redirectors.

  a. In Control Panel, double-click Network.

  b. On the Services tab, click Add, and then click Gateway (and Client)
     Service For NetWare.

  c. Click OK.

  d. Insert the Windows NT Server 4.0 CD or type the path to the location of
     the setup files, and then click Continue.

  e. Click Close, and then click Yes to restart the computer.

  f. Complete the Gateway (and Client) Service for NetWare installation:

     1. In Control Panel, double-click Network.

     2. In the Adapter box, click the network adapter you want to use for
        communication with the NetWare network.

        NOTE: By default, the network adapter frame type is 802.3.

     3. Click OK.

  g. Restart the computer.
