The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0, 4.0a, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Visual SourceSafe 6.0 automatically promotes a file into a preexisting project
label when the user creates a file label with the same name as the label applied
to its parent project. Automatic label promotions only work when both Visual
SourceSafe 6.0 is installed and the database has the updated database format.
Earlier versions of Visual SourceSafe do not allow you to promote a file by
applying a file label. Instead, you need to reapply the project label. For
additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q246910 INFO: How Do Label Promotions Work in SourceSafe 6.0

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following example leads you through the process of labeling a project,
editing a file in that project, then promoting the edited file into the existing
label. This example assumes that a project named MyProject exists in Visual
SourceSafe, and that the project contains a file named MyFile, whose current
version in Visual SourceSafe is version 3.

Step 1: Label the Project
-------------------------

1. Select the project called MyProject.

2. Select the Label option from the File menu.

3. Type in a label name for the project, like Version1.

Step 2: Modify the File
-----------------------

1. Select the file MyFile.

2. Check the file out, edit it, then check it back in.

At this point, the current version of MyFile is version 4. If you were to go into
the history of MyProject, select the label Version1, and retrieve the project,
you would get version 3 of MyFile. To associate version 4 of MyFile with the
Version1 label, you need to do the following:

Step 3: Promoting the Edited File into the Preexisting Label
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Select the project MyProject.

2. Choose the Label option from the File menu.

3. In the Label dialog box type Version1.

You receive a dialog box that states:

  The label Version1 is already used. Remove the old Label?

4. Click Yes.

This recycles the label name Version1, and you are now be able to retrieve the
project using the Version1 label and have Visual SourceSafe retrieve version 4
of MyFile rather than version 3.
