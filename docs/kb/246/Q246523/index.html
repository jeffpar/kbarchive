IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to add or delete a printer after you upgrade from Microsoft Windows
NT Server 3.51 to Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0, with File and Print Services
for Netware (FPNW) installed, you may receive the following error message:

  RPC Service unavailable

Event Viewer may display the following events:

  Event ID: 2510
  Source: SRV
  Type: Error
  Description: The server service was unable to map error code 1722.

  Event ID: 2510
  Source: SRV
  Type: Error
  Description: The server service was unable to map error code 1726.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because of a conflict between FPNW and the 'NWMON' value
in the registry.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this issue, perform one of the following procedures:

Install Service Pack 3 (SP3) for Windows NT 4.0. Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is
more stable with SP3 and may work better with a printer that is constantly busy
through LPR (Line Print Remote).

  -or-

Check to see if the 'NWMON' value exists in the registry, and if it does, delete
it. Follow these steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), and then use it to locate the following
  registry key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\ 

2. Save the Print key as a backup.

3. Delete the NWMON value.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

5. Stop the Spooler service, and then restart it.
