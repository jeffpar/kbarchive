MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

You can make a modification to the registry to control the loading of the Remote
Control video accelerator. Once you make this change, the accelerator never
loads. You can make this change for specific computers or the entire network.

Before you install the Remote Control component, create the following registry
key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Client\Configuration\SMS 1.2 Client
  Migration\Remote Control

Create a DWORD value named Install Video Driver and set the data value to 0
(zero). The value will be copied by the RemCtrl.ipf file to:

  HKLM\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Client\Client Components\Remote Control\Hardware
  Settings\Install Video Driver

If no value is found in the first registry location, the default value of 1 (one)
is written to the second location.

Valid values are:

  0= Never install driver
  1= Install if in driver list
  2= Always install, even if not in driver list

By using these values, you can also force computers to always load the video
driver.
