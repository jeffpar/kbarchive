-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, on platform(s):
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When building a Microsoft Visual FoxPro (VFP) executable, it is common practice
to attach a custom icon to it. Usually, the custom icon contains two or more
resources. This allows the icon to be displayed in various Windows views (small
icons, large icons, details, and so forth). If the custom icon contains a 16x16
resource with more than 256 colors, the resulting .exe file does not run on
Microsoft Windows NT 4. When the .exe file is started, it immediately exits with
a memory error.


RESOLUTION
==========

Build the 16x16 resource in the custom icon with 256 colors or fewer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Using Microangelo (manufactured by Impact Software:
  http://www.impactsoft.com/muangelo/muangelo.html) or some other icon editor,
  create an icon. Include a 32x32 resource with 256 colors, and a 16x16
  resource with more than 256 colors.

2. Open Visual FoxPro 6.0 and create a new project.

3. Add a new program to the project with one line of code:

  MESSAGEBOX("HELLO!")

4. With the project selected, press the CTRL+J key combination to bring up the
  Project Information window.

5. Use the Attach Icon checkbox to attach the icon created in step 1 to the
  project.

6. Build the project into an executable.

7. Run the .exe file on a computer running Microsoft Windows NT 4, and note that
  one of the following error messages appears:

  APPLICATION ERROR. The instruction at &lt;memory address&gt; referenced
  memory at &lt;memory address&gt;. The memory could not be "read".

  An application error has occurred and an application error log is being
  generated. &lt;exe name&gt;
  Exception: access violation:&lt;memory address&gt;, Address:&lt;memory
  address&gt;

  Fatal error: Exception code: C0000005
