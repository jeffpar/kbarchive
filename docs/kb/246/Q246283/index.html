SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to set the deleted item retention periods for the
public and private information stores and for individual mailboxes and public
folders in Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you set retention times for an individual mailbox or a single public
folder, or for an entire information store, you can also specify that no items
be deleted before the information store is backed up.

When you delete a message, Exchange Server marks the message for deletion but
also marks it as hidden until it is permanently deleted from the information
store. If you are using Microsoft Outlook version 8.03 or later, when you decide
to retrieve a message before its retention expiration time, you can click the
Deleted Item Recovery menu option on the Tools menu. The item is then visibly
restored to the Inbox, and Exchange Server removes the mark for deletion.

To specify how long to retain an item:

1. To set a retention period for an individual mailbox or a public folder:

  NOTE: By default, deleted item retention periods that you set on individual
  mailboxes or public folders override the settings on the private information
  store.

  a. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, open the mailbox (or the
     public folder), and then click the Limits tab.

  b. Type the appropriate number in the Use This Value (Days) box.

2. To set a retention period for an entire private or public information store:

  a. In the Exchange Administrator program, click to expand the &lt;Server&gt;
     container, and then click the information store (public or private, as
     applicable) that you need to set the retention time for.

  b. Click the General tab, and then type the appropriate number in the
     "Deleted item retention time (days)" box.
