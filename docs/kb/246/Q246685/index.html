The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3

SYMPTOMS
========

When adding additional objects (LUs, pools, and so forth) in SNA Manager, and
the limit to the number of that type of object has been reached, the user will
receive the following error:

  Limit Reached on Number of Objects of This Type

For example, if a user tries to assign more than 4,000 LUs to a particular user
or group, he or she will get this error.

CAUSE
=====

There are limits, set by design, to the number of objects that can be added to
SNA Manager, depending on the type of object.
