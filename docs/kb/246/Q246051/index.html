The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When the "Max Recipients on Submit" registry value is specified, and a message
is received through the Internet Mail Service that exceeds the number specified,
the message is not delivered. The message is moved into the Archive folder and
the sender does not receive a non-delivery report (NDR). The following Event ID
is logged at the server receiving the SMTP message.

  Event ID: 4117
  Source: MSExchangeIMC
  Type: Error
  Category: Internal Processing
  Description:
  An error was returned from the messaging software the Internet Mail Service
  uses to process messages on the Microsoft Exchange Server. As a result, the
  message in spool file WXJXSG2D failed to be delivered. The message has been
  moved to the IMCDATA\IN\ARCHIVE directory.

  Data:
  0000: 0001037f 80004005

CAUSE
=====

The information store is the entity responsible for enforcing the "Max
Recipients on Submit" functionality. The threshold includes the total number of
recipients to deliver the message to. This is the sum of the recipients listed
on the To, Cc, and Bcc lines. If any recipient is a Distribution List (DL), this
DL is expanded before the threshold value is evaluated.

When the Internet Mail Service attempts to deliver a message that exceeds this
threshold, the store tries to generate an NDR for the message. The NDR itself
contains a reference to the message received and because it exceeds the
threshold value, the information store policy does not allow the NDR to be
created (this applies to embedded messages within messages as well).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Internet Mail Service has been modified to produce a non-delivery report
(NDR) to the originator of the e-mail that exceeds the "Max Recipients on
Submit" threshold.

The NDR looks similar to the following:

From: IMSAdmin (IMS Admin on Destination Server)
Sent: Thursday, November 11, 1999 2:03 PM
To: Sender (User Sending Original Message)
Subject: Undeliverable: Testing

The following recipients did not receive the attached mail. Reasons are listed with each recipient:

&lt;/o=Organization/ou=Site/cn=Recipients/cn=User1&gt; User1
	MSEXCH:IMS:Organization:SITE:DESTSRVR 0 (00010256) Too many recipients.
&lt;/o=Organization/ou=Site/cn=Recipients/cn=HugeDL&gt; Huge DL
	MSEXCH:IMS:Organizatino:SITE:DESTSRVR 0 (00010256) Too many recipients.
&lt;/o=Organization/ou=Site/cn=Recipients/cn=User2&gt; User2
	MSEXCH:IMS:Organization:SITE:DESTSRVR 0 (00010256) Too many recipients.

The message that caused this notification was:
