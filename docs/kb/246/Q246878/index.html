-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Compass client is a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) client that
is required for Microsoft Metadirectory Services (MMS) management. You can also
use the Compass client for end user directory access. This article describes how
to configure a Compass client to log on to an MMS server. You can log on to a
Compass client using either of the following methods:

- Run Compass on the computer that has MMS installed.

- Connect to the MMS server remotely using another computer on the network.

This article describes how to set up the client to work with both situations.

MORE INFORMATION
================

How to Install the Compass Client
---------------------------------

1. If you are remotely installing a client computer, open a Web browser and
  connect to either the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the MMS server or the
  NetBIOS name of the MMS server.

2. The Your Metadirectory dialog box is displayed. In the lower left-hand side
  of the dialog box, click the Install Zoomit Compass arrow.

3. After the installation begins, click Next.

4. Verify the destination folder, and then click Next.

5. Click Finish to complete Setup.

The Compass icon is now displayed on the desktop.

How to Configure Compass to Run Locally on the MMS Server
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Double-click the Compass icon.

2. The Metadirectory Logon dialog box is displayed.

3. In the Name box, type the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) address of the
  logon account.

  After a new installation, the Administrator account is the only account in the
  database by default. This account is set to the following format:

  &lt;ServerName&gt;@&lt;FullyQualifiedServerIPName&gt;

  For example:

  someone@someone.dns.microsoft.com

  When additional accounts are created in the database, you log on using the
  SMTP address (stored as the mail attribute) and the correct password.

4. In the Password box, type the password, and then click OK.

  NOTE: The password is case sensitive.

5. In the Servers dialog box, make sure the name of the server is selected, and
  then click OK to log on to the MMS server.

How to Configure Compass to Connect to a Remote MMS Server
----------------------------------------------------------

1. Double-click the Compass icon.

2. The Metadirectory Logon dialog box is displayed.

3. In the Name dialog box, type the SMTP address of the logon account.

4. Click to select the "Select server manually" check box in advanced settings.
  If you do not select this check box, a broadcast mechanism is used to find
  the server to which the logon account belongs.

5. In the Password box, type the password, and then click OK.

6. When the Servers dialog box is displayed, click Configure.

7. In the Configure Server dialog box, click New.

8. In the Name box, type the server name.

9. In the Host Name or Address box, type the host name or IP address.

10. Keep the value in the Port box set to its default (389), unless you need to
  change the value (for example, if the port is being used by another
  program).

11. Click Apply, and then click OK.

12. Click OK, and then log on to the specified MMS server.

For more information about the Compass client and how to administer an MMS
server, refer to the online documentation.
