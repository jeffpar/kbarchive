-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In an environment where Internet mail from Lotus Notes is configured to go to
Exchange Server, a message from Lotus Notes using a default Request for Comments
(RFC) 822 format (for example: &lt;username&gt;@&lt;domainname&gt;.com) comes
across the Exchange Notes Connector as
NOTES:&lt;username&gt;@&lt;domainname&gt;.com.

Because the message does not have the @&lt;Exchange&gt; information showing that
it is destined for the Exchange Server organization, the message is returned to
Lotus Notes rather than transferred to the Internet Mail Service for delivery.
After the message loops between Exchange Server and Notes three or four times,
Notes recognizes that the message is stuck, and generates a non-delivery report
(NDR) for the message to the user.

CAUSE
=====

Messages sent from Lotus Notes through Exchange Server to the Internet require
an address format of &lt;SMTP_address&gt;@&lt;Exchange&gt; so that Exchange
Server knows that the message is destined for the Internet Mail Service. For
example, the Lotus Notes destination address of
&lt;username&gt;@&lt;domainname&gt;.com needs to be addressed as
&lt;username&gt;@&lt;domainname&gt;.com@Exchange (where Exchange is the Notes
foreign domain name of the Exchange Notes Connector.)
