SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use a roaming profile, you may be unable to run some of the
available programs as they are configured in your roaming profile.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the computer you are using has a very low amount of free
hard disk space (approximately equal to or less than the roaming profile size)
on the boot partition of your hard disk. When you log on to a client computer,
your roaming profile is copied to the local client computer as a locally cached
profile. However, if the computer you are using has a very low amount of free
hard disk space, the locally cached profile can become damaged. Also, when you
log off from this client computer, your locally cached profile is copied to the
your roaming profile, and this may cause your permanent roaming profile to
become damaged.
