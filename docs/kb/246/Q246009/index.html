SUMMARY
=======

In response to a connection problem with Lotus Notes, Microsoft has released an
updated version of Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6. The updated version is named
Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6a. In addition to the problems resolved in Service
Pack 6, Service Pack 6a includes:

- A resolution to the Winsock problem that prevents Lotus Notes and other
  Winsock-based programs from connecting to the server when a user does not
  have local administrator rights.

the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

- A revised version of Winver.exe to allow users to quickly verify whether a
  computer is running Service Pack 6 or Service Pack 6a.

- An update to the Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) 3.0 Log
  Converter utility (Convlog.exe).

the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q245329 Convlog.exe Converts Year 2000 Dates to Year 2028

- An update to an AppleTalk file (Sfmatalk.sys) to avoid a "Stop 44" error
  message on a blue screen while you are connected an AppleTalk network or an
  Apple print server. The problem involves two events, one of which almost
  always finishes before the other. The error message can occur when the
  expected order is reversed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine whether you are running Service Pack 6 or Service Pack 6a:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "winver" (without the quotation marks), and then click
  OK. If you are running Service Pack 6a, the About Windows NT dialog box
  states:

  Microsoft(R) Windows NT (R)
  Version 4.0 (Build 1381: Service Pack 6)
  Copyright (C) 1981-1996 Microsoft Corp
  Revised Service Pack 6a

If you are running Service Pack 6, the About Windows NT dialog box states:

  Microsoft(R) Windows NT (R)
  Version 4.0 (Build 1381: Service Pack 6)
  Copyright (C) 1981-1996 Microsoft Corp

Programs can detect whether Service Pack 6a is installed by checking to see if
the following registry value is set to 1:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
  NT\CurrentVersion\Hotfix\Q246009\Installed

Updating Service Pack 6 to 6a
-----------------------------

If you have already installed Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6, you can update your
computer to Service Pack 6a by installing the SP6a hotfix.
