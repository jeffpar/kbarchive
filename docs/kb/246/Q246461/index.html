SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses issues regarding validation on a backup domain
controller, and how to prevent validation on this backup domain controller.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can prevent validation on a specific backup domain controller by pausing the
Netlogon service. The backup domain controller does not allow any new
connections, but it does not disconnect any existing connections.

When users attempt to directly obtain access to resources on the backup domain
controller with the paused Netlogon service, validation occurs locally at that
backup domain controller, and is not forwarded to any other domain controller.
So pausing the Netlogon service on a particular backup domain controller is
useful for reducing the load on that backup domain controller, because
workstations and other member servers are not able to set up their secure
channels with that backup domain controller.

Stopping the service instead of pausing it prevents the backup domain controller
from receiving updates from the primary domain controller. Pausing it after your
computer starts permits the domain controller to set up a secure channel with
the primary domain controller to receive updates to the accounts database. If
this occurs, users may be unable to obtain access with valid passwords after a
password change has occurred.

You cannot set the Netlogon service to pause on startup, and it would be
inadvisable to do so because the Netlogon service must run long enough to set up
a secure channel with the primary domain controller. However, you can automate
the service to pause after startup by using the AT scheduler to run the NET
PAUSE NETLOGON command. You can also use the Windows NT Server Resource Kit
Sleep.exe utility to start a batch file to run this command in a loop, and set
the delay between intervals.
