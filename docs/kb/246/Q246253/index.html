-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Site folders are deleted for Exchange Server sites that exist in the directory.
Servers experiencing this issue may have messaging clients that have
difficulties accessing Schedule+ free and busy information and offline Address
Books for specific sites in the Exchange Server organization.

Users may receive a message similar to the following:

  Unable to update public free/busy data. The contents of this public folder
  are currently unavailable. Either the Microsoft Exchange Server computer
  servicing this public folder is down or the public folder has not been
  replicated to this site. See your administrator.

-or-

  An error occurred while opening the Microsoft Exchange offline address book
  files on the Microsoft Exchange Server. See your administrator.

If diagnostic logging levels are turned to Maximum for Replication Site Folders
in the public information store, you may see events similar to the following
when you start the information store:

  Event ID: 3051
  Source: MSExchangeIS Public
  Type: Information
  Category: Replication Site Folders
  Description: The unused site folder (1b4-7) NON_IPM_SUBTREE\SCHEDULE+ FREE
  BUSY\EX:/o=ORGANIZATION/ou=SITE-NAME was deleted.

-and-

  Event ID: 3051
  Source: MSExchangeIS Public
  Type: Information
  Category: Replication Site Folders
  Description: The unused site folder (1b4-8) NON_IPM_SUBTREE\OFFLINE ADDRESS
  BOOK\EX:/o=ORGANIZATION/ou=SITE-NAME was deleted.

CAUSE
=====

A process within the information store compares a sorted list of Exchange Server
sites (obtained from the directory) to a sorted list of Exchange Server sites
present in the public information store (obtained by a query to the information
store). These two lists are not sorted by the same string comparison operation,
which results in two lists that differ slightly (usually a difference which
affects sites with special characters, such as the hyphen character).


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

NOTE: When you start this version of the information store, the information store
databases are automatically upgraded to a new format. After the databases have
been upgraded, you can restore an earlier version of the Store.exe file on the
server, but only if it is version 5.5.2651.32 or later. If you restore a
Store.exe file earlier than version 5.5.2651.32 after the database has been
upgraded, you are no longer able to start the information store. For additional
