-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you run a repair process on a Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0-based
computer that is configured with a volume set, one of the drives may not appear
in Windows Explorer. Also, Disk Administrator may show the drive with or without
an assigned drive letter and may list it as Unknown.

All configurations that use fault tolerance with either file allocation table
(FAT) or NTFS file system volumes may exhibit these symptoms.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when you use repair information from your hard disk
drive instead of from an updated Emergency Repair Disk, and the information on
the hard drive does not include the latest fault tolerance configuration.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, please refer to the instructions in the following
articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q131658 Use Ftedit.exe to Recover Fault Tolerant Disk Configuration.

  Q149927 Ftedit.exe: What You Can and Can't Use It For

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you run the Rdisk utility and choose the Update Repair Info option, the
system writes up-to-date information to the %SystemRoot%\Repair folder on the
hard disk drive, and then it prompts you to update or create the ERD. If you
choose Create Repair Disk, the system does not update the repair information
before copying it directly to the ERD.

It is also important to make sure that Ftdisk is set to a start value of Boot and
that it is started. Ftdisk is the device driver that handles input and output
for volume sets, stripe sets, mirror sets, and stripe sets with parity. If the
drive still appears as Unknown in Disk Administrator after you restore disk
information, use the Devices tool in Control Panel to check the start value of
Ftdisk.
