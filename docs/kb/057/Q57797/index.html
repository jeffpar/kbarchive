Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) version 7.00 has
not been fully tested under nor is it guaranteed to run under any
version of Novell NetWare. Below are some confirmed and unconfirmed
cases of problems using BASIC PDS 7.00 programs with Novell NetWare.

Confirmed QBX.EXE Hanging Report
--------------------------------

1. Microsoft Product Support Services performed one test that showed
   that QBX.EXE may hang under Novell Advanced NetWare version 2.15
   revision C. This test was performed on an IBM AT with a 16-bit
   Ungermann Bass network card. The test was run on a nondedicated
   Novell server. The QBX.EXE editor screen comes up, but at this
   point, the machine hangs and requires a cold reboot.

   This information applies to the QBX.EXE editor that comes with
   Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) version 7.00
   for MS-DOS.

Unconfirmed QBX.EXE Hanging Reports
-----------------------------------

1. A customer reported that QBX.EXE can hang under the following
   configuration:

      COMPAQ 386/20 or ALR 386/33 computer
      Version 2.15 Novell Advanced NetWare
      Micom Interland board NI52100TP-8
      Microsoft Mouse 7.00

   When the customer booted without the Novell drivers, or with the
   Novell drivers and without the Microsoft Mouse 7.00 driver, QBX.EXE
   worked correctly without hanging. Microsoft has not confirmed this
   information.

2. A customer reported that QBX.EXE can hang under the following
   configuration:

      IBM PS/2 Model 50z computer
      Version 2.15 revision C Novell SFT network

3. A customer reported that a BASIC PDS 7.00 program using the
   OPEN COM statement may hang on a workstation connected to Novell
   Advanced NetWare version 2.15 revision A. When a Quarterdeck QEMM
   version 5.00 expanded memory driver was installed, the machine
   would not hang, but instead, QEMM would return an "Exception 12"
   error. When the software for the Novell Network was removed, the
   computer would not hang, nor would it generate an Exception 12
   error with the QEMM driver loaded. Microsoft has not confirmed this
   problem. The customer reported the problem on the following
   configuration:

      Dell System 310
      Novell Advanced NetWare version 2.15 revision A
      DOS version 3.30
      80387 math coprocessor
      4 MB extended memory
      Video Seven VGA video card
      Phoenix 80386 ROM BIOS Plus version 1.10 A05
      Western Digital EtherCard Plus 16, or 3Com EtherLink card

4. A customer reported that QBX.EXE hangs on the following
   configuration (customer did not test same program run from .EXE):

      Novell NetWare 2.15 SFT revision C
      Everex Step 386
      Version 3 AMI BIOS
      MS-DOS version 4.01

5. A customer reported that QBX.EXE hangs on the following
   configuration (customer did not test same program run from .EXE):

    Novell SFT NetWare 286 version 2.15 revision B
    Uknown name AT 286
    1 MB RAM
    MDI Graphics Card (Hercules-compatible)
    MF-II keyboard
    MS-DOS 3.30
