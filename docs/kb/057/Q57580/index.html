Some developers using Microsoft BASIC or QuickBASIC may suggest that a
single-byte, unsigned data type should be added to BASIC. As of
Microsoft BASIC PDS Version 7.00 or QuickBASIC Version 4.50 or
earlier, a single-byte data type hasn't yet been implemented. If you
support this suggestion, please send Microsoft your (customer)
comments about what you would use this data type for and what kinds
of operations you would like to see it support.

For example, would you like the single-byte data type to be a fully
implemented short integer complete with overflow checking and coercion
to floating point or longer integers for the appropriate operations,
or would you like to see it implemented as a simple, small, and fast
data type with a subset of these operations? What are the ranges of
uses that you can see for such a data type in your programs?

We'd like to know what kinds of uses people envision for a single-byte
data type before we consider adding the overhead to the product.

Please send in your comments to Microsoft Product Support
(206-454-2030) so we may forward them to the Microsoft BASIC Program
Manager. Your input will be greatly appreciated.
