Question:

In DOS, I am spawning either MAKE or NMAKE within the Microsoft Editor
(M), and I receive an error message from the Editor on the status line
saying "U1013 : Link file.obj: Error 2." What does this error mean and
how do I get around it?

Response:

The U1013 error means that one of the procedures called by MAKE or
NMAKE returned a nonzero error code. In this case, the error can be
understood as M's equivalent of a "Not enough memory for exec" error,
meaning that there is not enough memory for the parent process to
execute a child process. The error typically occurs when you spawn
either MAKE or NMAKE from within the Editor, the compilation is
complete, and the link process is beginning.

If you receive this error, you may be able to free up memory by
removing any TSRs and unnecessary device drivers. However, the best
workaround would be to use MAKE or NMAKE to link your file outside of
M, because M will have problems exec'ing the linker in any sizable
application due to the size of LINK and MAKE.
