ERDEV is an integer function that returns an error code from the last
device to declare a critical error. ERDEV is set by the critical error
handler, interrupt 24Hex, when DOS detects a critical DOS call error.

For block and character device errors, ERDEV will contain the error
code from interrupt 24Hex in the lower 8 bits. For block devices only,
bit positions 9 to 16 contain device-attribute information which is
found in the device-driver header of the device that the error is
coming from.

The above information applies to Microsoft GW-BASIC versions 3.20,
3.22, and 3.23; to Microsoft QuickBASIC versions 2.00, 3.00, 4.00,
4.00b, and 4.50; to Microsoft BASIC Compiler versions 6.00 and 6.00b
for MS-DOS; and to Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System
(PDS) versions 7.00 and 7.10 for MS-DOS.

When using Microsoft BASIC PDS version 7.00 or 7.10 for MS-DOS, ERDEV
can also be set by a time-out error on the communications port and
indicates which option in the OPEN COM statement (CD, CS, or DS) is
experiencing the time-out.

If ERDEV returns an error from a block device (such as a floppy disk
drive or fixed disk) or from a character device (such as a terminal or
printer), the low byte of ERDEV will return the DOS error code, a
value between 0 and 12. The following is a list of these errors:

    0  write-protect error
    1  unknown unit
    2  drive not ready
    3  unknown command
    4  date error (CRC)
    5  bad request structure length
    6  seek error
    7  unknown media type
    8  sector not found
    9  printer out of paper
   10  write fault
   11  read fault
   12  general failure
   13  reserved
   14  reserved
   15  invalid disk change (MS-DOS version 3.0 only)

For more information on DOS error codes, see INT 24H on Page 481 of
"Advanced MS-DOS Programming, 2nd Edition," by Ray Duncan (Microsoft
Press, 1988).

If the device returning an error is a block device, the high byte of
the integer returned by ERDEV will contain device attribute
information. This device attribute information comes from the
device-attribute word in the device header. The only bits from this
word returned by ERDEV are bits 15, 14, 13, XX, 3, 2, 1, and 0, in
that order. XX indicates that bits 12 through 4 of the
device-attribute word will always return zero. The following is a
description of the bits in the device-attribute word that are
meaningful to ERDEV:

     Bit
   Position   Bit     Significance
   --------   ---     ------------

      8       15      0 if block device
      7       14      1 if IOCTL read and write supported
      6       13      1 if BIOS parameter block in boot sector
                        should be used to determine media
                        characteristics
                      0 if media ID byte should be used
      4        3      1 if current CLOCK$ device
      3        2      1 if current NUL device
      2        1      1 if driver supports 32-bit sector addressing
                        (MS-DOS 4.00)
      1        0      1 if current standard input device (stdin)

For more information on device-attribute words, see Page 264 of the
"Advanced MS-DOS Programming" Microsoft Press book.

When using BASIC PDS version 7.00, ERDEV also returns information for
COM time-out errors in the low byte. If there is a time-out, ERDEV is
set to a value that indicates the signal line that timed out,
according to the following table:

   ERDEV Value    Signal Line
   -----------    -----------

      128         Clear to Send (CTS) timeout
      129         Data Set Ready (DSR) timeout
      130         Data Carrier Detect (DCD) timeout

The following program lines generate the DOS and COM time-out error
codes (low byte) and device attribute information (high byte):

   x= ERDEV
   DosErrCode = x AND &amp;HFF            'Low byte of ERDEV
   DevAttr = (x AND &amp;HFF00) \256      'High byte of ERDEV

The following example prints the values of ERDEV after the program
tries to OPEN a read only file for OUTPUT:

Example
-------

DEFINT A-Z
ON ERROR GOTO ErrorHandler
OPEN "C:\TheFile.DAT" FOR OUTPUT A #1   'TheFile is a read-only
                                        'file
END

ErrorHandler:
   x = ERDEV
   DosErrCode = x AND &amp;HFF              'low byte of ERDEV
   PRINT "The DOS error code returned by ERDEV =&gt; "; x
RESUME NEXT
