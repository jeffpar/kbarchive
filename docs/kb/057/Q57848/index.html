The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 2.0, 2.0a, 2.0b, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

IMPORTANT: All Microsoft Mail version 2.0 customers who have gateways installed
should be using the "MS Mail GW" file version 2.0b and the "Microsoft Mail
Server" file version 2.0b, both of which are located in the System Folder of the
Mail server. An updated "MS Mail GW" file is available through Microsoft End
User Sales and Service at (800) 426-9400 or Microsoft International Customer
Service at (206) 936-8661 but ONLY for customers using the AppleLink Gateway to
Microsoft Mail. Customers using other gateways must obtain an updated "MS Mail
GW" file from the developer of the gateway they are using. The Microsoft Mail
server upgrade can also be obtained at the above numbers.


Before creating an AppleLink gateway account, the AppleLink gateway must have
previously been installed on the Microsoft Mail server by using the Gateway
Installer program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create an AppleLink gateway account, do the following:

1. Sign in as Network Manager.

2. From the Mail menu, choose Gateway Accounts to bring up the Define Gateway
  Accounts window. In Mail version 3.0, choose Gateway from the Mail menu, then
  select Accounts.

3. Click the icon for the AppleLink gateway.

4. Fill in the information for the following:

  a. Name - In the case of the AppleLink gateway, the account name is used only
     to identify accounts.

  b. AppleLink mail address - The address on AppleLink to be used. A typical
     AppleLink address might be "D4751" (without the quotation marks) or a
     name, such as "John.Doe" (without the quotation marks).

  c. AppleLink password - The password of the above AppleLink mail address.

5. Click the Add User button to bring up the Define Account Members window to
  add users to the account. In some cases, you will add one user per AppleLink
  gateway account. In other cases, such as a small company that has only one
  AppleLink account, you will give many users access to the account. Click the
  Close button to exit the Define Account Members window when done.

6. Highlight the user or group name that will receive all incoming gateway mail
  for this account. For more information, query on the following keywords:

  "default" (without the quotation marks) and "user" (without the quotation
  marks)

7. Click the Define button. To create more accounts, repeat steps 4 through 7,
  or click the close box of the Define Gateway Accounts window to exit.

Additional query words: 2.00 2.00a 2.00b 3.00
