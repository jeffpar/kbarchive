Question:

Why doesn't Microsoft offer an educational edition of BASIC PDS
(Professional Development System) Version 7.00?

Response:

Microsoft instead recommends one of the following products for
educational institutions and people who want to teach modern BASIC on
IBM Personal Computers or compatibles:

1. "Learn BASIC Now" by Halvorson and Rygmyr, published by Microsoft
   Press, 1989.

   This is the fastest, easiest way to learn modern QuickBASIC
   programming. The book includes a disk with the Microsoft QuickBASIC
   Interpreter (QBI.EXE), the QBI Advisor complete electronic
   reference, the QuickBASIC Express online tutorial and introduction
   to the interpreter, and dozens of sample programs. The book teaches
   BASIC programming step by step.

2. Microsoft QuickBASIC Interpreter, Academic Edition Version 1.00,
   for IBM Personal Computers and Compatibles

   This product is entirely disk based, without a printed manual. The
   disk contains the Microsoft QuickBASIC Interpreter (QBI.EXE), the
   QBI Advisor complete electronic reference, the QuickBASIC Express
   online tutorial and introduction to the interpreter, and dozens of
   sample programs.

The above two QuickBASIC Interpreter (QBI.EXE) products have the same
language features found in Microsoft QuickBASIC Version 4.50 for IBM
PCs and compatibles. (Note that the QBI.EXE interpreter environment
has some limitations compared to QB.EXE 4.50).

We found no compelling reason to make a special academic edition for
BASIC PDS 7.00 since the only features in 7.00 not found in the
existing QuickBASIC academic editions are all targeted for people
making professional, commercial applications and are not crucial for
teaching BASIC.
