In the QuickBASIC environment, you can move a whole block of text
horizontally by highlighting the block and then pressing the TAB key
to move it. You can move it any number of spaces by changing the
length of the tab stop in the Options menu and then highlighting the
text and pressing TAB to move it to the new tab stop.

If you wish to move the block to the left, press SHIFT+TAB while the
block is highlighted.

One limitation is that you can move only whole lines at a time. You
cannot select a column range.

This information applies to QB.EXE in Microsoft QuickBASIC Versions
4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50 for MS-DOS, to QB.EXE in Microsoft BASIC
Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS, and to QBX.EXE
(QuickBASIC Extended) in Microsoft BASIC Professional Development
System (PDS) 7.00 for MS-DOS.

In QB.EXE Versions 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50, do not try to move the
selected block of text using the SPACEBAR because this will delete the
text. There is no way to restore this text, since these versions can
undo only the last edit. The last edit, in this case, is the space
entered by pressing the SPACEBAR, not the deletion of the text.
Pressing ALT+BACKSPACE (or selecting Undo from the Edit menu) simply
removes the space and does not bring back the deleted text.

QBX.EXE in Microsoft BASIC PDS Version 7.00 allows you to undo the
last 20 edits performed, so in the same situation as above, the text
is recoverable by pressing ALT+BACKSPACE several times consecutively.
