-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MechWarrior 4: Black Knight 
- Microsoft MechWarrior 4: Vengeance 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to start MechWarrior 4: Black Knight, the program may stop
responding (freeze) on a black screen that displays an hourglass, or you may
receive an error message similar to the following:

  AppName: mw4.icd AppVer: 1.6.11.220 ModName: mw4.icd ModVer: 1.6.11.220
  Offset: 00309380

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if your installation of MechWarrior is faulty or
incomplete. This may occur when an open program or background program interferes
with the installation process.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, remove MechWarrior, clean-boot your computer, and then
reinstall MechWarrior. To do this, follow these steps.

NOTE: Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following
steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product
documentation to complete these steps.

Remove MechWarrior
------------------

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
  Add/Remove Programs.

2. Select MechWarrior Black Knight in the list of currently installed programs,
  and then click Add/Remove.

3. Click Uninstall, and then follow the instructions to complete the removal
  process.

4. Repeat these steps to remove MechWarrior Vengeance and any other MechWarrior
  programs that may be installed on your computer.

5. Locate and then delete the following folder

  &lt;drive&gt;:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\MechWarrior Vengeance

  where drive is the drive on which MechWarrior was installed. This path assumes
  a default installation, and may vary depending on your installation.

Remove Temporary Files
----------------------

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to System Tools,
  and then click Disk Cleanup.

2. In the Select Drive dialog box, select your system disk (the disk on which
  Windows is installed), and then click OK.

3. Under "Files to delete", click to select the Temporary Files check box, and
  then click OK.

4. Repeat these steps for any other local drives on your computer.

Use a Clean Boot to Start Your Computer
---------------------------------------

When you start Windows normally, there are a number of programs that start
automatically and run in the background. These programs, which may include
antivirus and system utility programs, may sometimes interfere with the
installation of a new program.

When you perform a clean boot before you install a new program, you prevent these
programs from starting automatically. For additional information about how to
perform a clean boot, click the article numbers below to view the articles in

  Q243039 How to Perform a Clean Boot in Windows 95

Reinstall MechWarrior
---------------------

1. Insert your MechWarrior CD-ROM into your computer's CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive.

2. If the Setup program begins automatically, go to step 5.

3. If Setup does not start automatically, click Start, point to Settings, click
  Control Panel, and then double-click Add/Remove Programs.

4. In the Install/Uninstall window, click Install.

5. Follow the instructions to complete the installation process.
