SYMPTOMS
========

If the Internet Mail Service receives a malformed inbound Internet message, the
Internet Mail Service may log event ID 12800, 4182, 4102, and 1001 error
messages in the Application event log, and then stop responding. The error
messages are logged in the Application event log in the following sequence:

  EventID : 12800
  Source : MSExchangeIS
  Type : Error
  Category : Content Engine
  Description:
  Message processing failed because there is not enough available memory
  (8007000E-F2000200).

  EventID : 4182
  Source : MSExchangeIMC
  Type : Error
  Category : Internal Processing
  Description:
  An error was returned from the messaging software the Internet Mail Service
  uses to process messages on the Microsoft Exchange Server. As a result, the
  message in spool file MM0XK5MC will be retried when the server is restarted.

  EventID : 4102
  Source : MSExchangeIMC
  Type : Error
  Category : Internal Processing
  Description:
  A serious error has occurred while trying to send mail into the Exchange
  Information Store. The Internet Mail Service is being shut down.

  EventID : 1001

  Type : Information
  Category : Initialization/Termination
