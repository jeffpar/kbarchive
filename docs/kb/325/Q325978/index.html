-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Train Simulator, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Train Simulator, you receive an error message similar to the
following:

  Microsoft Train Simulator has detected that your graphics hardware may be
  lacking essential features that it needs to run. Please ensure that you have
  the latest drivers from your graphics card manufacturer's web site.

-or-

When you start the Train Simulator Troubleshooter, you see this message:

  Train Simulator requires hardware acceleration.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may occur when one or more of the following conditions are true:

- Your video card is not installed properly.

- Your computer does not meet the minimum three-dimensional (3-D) hardware
  requirements to run Train Simulator.

- Microsoft DirectDraw acceleration is turned off (disabled).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use the following methods in the order in which they
are presented.

NOTE: Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following
steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product
documentation to complete these steps.

Method 1: Verify That Your Video Adapter Meets the Minimum Requirements:

For additional information about the system requirements to run Train Simulator,
click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q299762 Train Simulator: Minimum System Requirements

Use the Microsoft DirectX Diagnostic Tool to determine how much video memory is
installed on your video adapter. To do this, follow these steps.

NOTE: If your video acceleration is not set to Full, the diagnostic tool may
report less memory than is actually present on your video adapter. See the "More
Information" section of this article for steps to make sure that your video
acceleration is set correctly before you run this test.

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "dxdiag" (without the quotation marks), and then click
  OK.

3. Click the Display tab or Display 1 tab.

4. Under Device, note how much video memory is listed next to Approx. Total
  Memory.

5. Click Exit.

If less than 4 megabytes (MB) of video memory is installed on your video adapter,
install additional video memory, or install a video adapter with more video
memory.

If this does not resolve the problem, go to method 2.

Method 2: Install the Latest Video Driver for Your Video Adapter:

Contact your video adapter manufacturer for information about how to obtain and
install the latest video driver for your video adapter. For additional
information about how to determine which driver version you have installed,
