-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) SNA Manager snap-in, you
receive the following error message:

  Communication with the servers has been lost. SNA Manager must be restarted.

Additionally, an Event 5149 similar to the following is logged in the Application
Event Log:

  Event ID: 5149
  Event Source: SNA Manage Agent
  Description: Manage base error - error in accessing the domain table. The
  local domain name is not valid

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs when the SNA Manage Client (Mngcli.exe) process tries to
start without having received the startup parameters that it requires to start
successfully. This behavior may occur when certain types of applications are run
on the same computer that is running Host Integration Server 2000. Antivirus
software and system monitoring software are examples of the types of
applications that might affect how the SNA Manager Client process starts.


RESOLUTION
==========

If the server computer that is running Windows NT or Windows 2000 is also
running any third-party applications, try to determine if one of the
applications is causing the problem by removing the applications one at a time.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, follow these steps:

1. Open a command prompt.

2. Change to the &lt;SNA Root&gt; directory.

3. Run Snaexp.cmd from the command prompt.
