SYMPTOMS
========

Passflt.dll is used by administrators to ensure that strong passwords are being
used on the domain. However, Passflt.dll is used in conjunction with the domain
policy for password length. If the domain policy allows for a blank password
(that is, a zero-length password) and a user changes his or her password to, for
example, "Mm1", the password change succeeds. This occurs because the password
length is longer than 0 (zero), an uppercase and a lowercase character was used,
and a non-alphabetical character was used as well.

CAUSE
=====

Passflt.dll does not check for a minimum length of 6 characters.


RESOLUTION
==========

Passflt.dll has been modified to check the length of the password.
