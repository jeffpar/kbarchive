SYMPTOMS
========

When installing MSN Explorer, a dialog box pops up saying "A file being copied
is older than the file currently on your computer."

CAUSE
=====

MSN Explorer may install Dial Up Networking (DUN) (version 1.4). It does this
installation when it determines that the current DUN was not completely or
correctly installed.

DUN 1.4 includes one or more files that may duplicate files on a computer from an
earlier DUN version, but with a lower version number. When this happens, Windows
will show a dialogue box that says the user is about to replace a newer file
with and older file and asks if the user wants to continue.

For instance, when Internet Explorer 5.0a is installed on Windows 95, it installs
DUN 1.3. This DUN includes, among others, a copy of vserver.vxd. Dun 1.4,
installed by Windows Explorer, also has a copy of this file, but with an earlier
version number.

So, if MSN Explorer tries to install the DUN over the DUN from Internet Explorer
5 on Windows 95, it detects that the older file is about to be installed and
prompts the user. The use is given the choice as to whether they should install
this older file or not.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft recommends that the user accept all the files being installed by MSN
Explorer, even if it appears that one or more files are older than what is on
the computer.
