-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========


Exchange Server computers may encounter backlogs of items that are awaiting
inbound conversion on the Internet Mail Service after you apply the fix from the
following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q268357 XADM: Exchange Clients Appear to Hang When Information Store Queries
  Directory

The inbound conversion queue may not clear until the services are stopped and
restarted. The services, particularly the information store, may take an
abnormally long time to shut down or may stop responding (hang) while they are
shutting down, whether or not the server has an Internet Mail Service
configured.


CAUSE
=====

The deadlock is caused by two threads that are waiting for two critical sections
to complete. Thread 1 enters critsec A. Thread 2 enters critsec B. Before either
thread releases the critical sections, thread 1 asks for critsec B and thread 2
asks for critsec A. This behavior was not a problem before the fix because the
work being done before was all on the same thread, and locking order did not
matter.

RESOLUTION
==========


To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack




STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
Store.exe builds 5.5.2653.7 through 5.5.2653.18. This problem was first
corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To test this, import a lot of directory changes at the same time that you are
modifying objects such as protocols, site addressing, or the Gateway Address
Resolution Table (GWART). You must have many small changes being imported to
catch this.
