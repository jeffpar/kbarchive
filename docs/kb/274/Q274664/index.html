SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Microsoft Crimson Skies after you complete at least one mission,
the game may start at the first mission of the game and your saved games may be
lost.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if Status.dat file for the game is damaged. This
behavior can occur for any of the following reasons:

- After you complete a single player mission, you immediately start a
  multiplayer game, and then you return to the single player campaign using the
  default player in the game.

- After you complete a single player mission, you immediately start a
  multiplayer game, you build a custom plane, and then you return to the single
  player campaign using the default player in the game.

  NOTE: This issue can occur whether or not you play the multiplayer game.

- After you complete a single player mission, you start an Instant Action game,
  you build a custom plane, and then you return to the single player campaign
  using the default player in the game.

  NOTE: This issue can occur whether or not you play the Instant Action game.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, download and install the Crmsk101.exe patch from the
following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/games/crimsonskies/downloads.asp

The Crmsk101.exe file is 2.2 megabytes in size. After you install the
Crmsk101.exe patch, the version of the Crimson.exe file is 1.1.

STATUS
======
