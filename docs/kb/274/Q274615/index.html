-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 2: WWII Pacific Theater, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to host a multiplayer game of Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator
2: WWII Pacific Theater, you may experience the following symptoms:

- Other players may be unable to find your game session.

- When you click Get IP on the Ready Room screen, Combat Flight Simulator 2 may
  report your IP address as the reserved IP loopback address (127.00.00.01).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if any of the following conditions is true:

- You used the IP Configuration tool (Ipconfig.exe or Winipcfg.exe) to release
  and renew the IP address for your dial-up Internet connection, and then
  attempted to host a multiplayer game.

- You used the IP Configuration tool to release the IP address for your network
  adapter, and did not renew the IP address.

- When you started your computer, the computer could not automatically obtain
  an IP address from your network domain name server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the appropriate method for your TCP/IP network
connection.

Dial-Up Internet Connection
---------------------------

Disconnect from the Internet, and then establish a new connection to the
Internet.

Local Area Network (LAN) Connection
-----------------------------------

Use the IP Configuration tool (Ipconfig.exe or Winipcfg.exe) to renew the IP
address for your network adapter. To do this:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type the appropriate line for your version of Microsoft
  Windows, and then click OK:

  Microsoft Windows 95 or later:

  winipcfg.exe

  Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 or Microsoft Windows 2000:

  ipconfig.exe

3. Click Release All, click Renew All, and then click OK.

If the issue continues to occur, restart the computer, and then log on to your
LAN.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you use the IP Configuration tool to release your IP address, Windows
reports that your IP address is the reserved IP loopback address (127.0.0.01).
The IP loopback address is reserved for use in diagnosing TCP/IP connection
problems. It is not a valid IP network address.
