MORE INFORMATION
================

Installation of IIS 5.0
-----------------------

NOTE: IIS 5.0 is an integrated component of Windows 2000. Unlike IIS 4.0, it is
not available as a separate download.

Upgrade Path:

- Windows NT 4.0 Server: If you upgrade Windows NT Server 4.0 to Windows 2000
  Server, IIS 5.0 is automatically installed.

- Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows NT Workstation 4.0: If you upgrade Windows
  95, Windows 98, or Windows NT Workstation 4.0 to Windows 2000 Professional,
  by default, IIS 5.0 is not installed unless Personal Web Server (PWS) has
  already been installed on the computer.

  For more information, see Run IIS 5.0 Instead of PWS on Windows 2000
  Professional
  (http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q262/6/32.asp).

Pre-Installation Checklist:

- Moving from a non-Microsoft Web server to IIS: For information on migrating
  from other Web servers, see the TechNet article Getting Ready for IIS 5.0
  (http://www.microsoft.com/TechNet/iis/ready.asp).

- Windows 2000 System Requirements:
  http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/upgrade/

- IIS Topics in the Windows 2000 Help: Initial information about using IIS,
  including how to install it, a software checklist, and how to test your new
  IIS installation are all located in the Windows 2000 Help file in the
  following location:

  Internet Tools and Services\Internet Information Services

- Installing on a stand-alone or member server computer: In addition to the
  heavy load that is placed on a computer acting as both a Domain Controller
  and IIS server, synchronization problems such as those described in the
  Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q190005, A Site Set Up for Anonymous Access
  Prompts Users for Password
  (http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/q190/0/05.asp) can occur.

Manually Installing IIS 5.0:

NOTE: When you install IIS, you can choose among several subcomponents in IIS.
For information on what each subcomponents does, see
http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/server/evaluation/features/web.asp.

If IIS 5.0 has not already been installed on your Windows 2000 computer, perform
the following steps to install it:

1. On the Start menu, click Control Panel, and then click "Add/Remove Programs".

2. Select "Add/Remove Windows Components", select the Internet Information
  Services (IIS) component, and then follow the on-screen instructions.

Online Help and Documentation
-----------------------------

- Local online documentation: When a default installation of IIS is performed,
  the documentation is installed on the local computer, and viewed by using the
  URL http://localhost/iisHelp/.

- Internet-Based Documentation: Additionally, this documentation is also
  available at http://windows.microsoft.com/windows2000/en/server/iis/.

- Book: This documentation is also available in the Microsoft Press book,
  Microsoft(R) Internet Information Services 5.0 Documentation
  (http://mspress.microsoft.com/prod/books/3250.htm).

Programming and Developing
--------------------------

- Microsoft TechNet - Windows Web Services (IIS)
  (http://www.microsoft.com/technet/iis/)

- Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN): Server Technologies
  (http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/c-frame.htm?/workshop/server/)

- Internet Information Services SDK
  (http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/psdk/iisref/psdkwelc.htm): The SDK
  provides detailed information about creating ASP pages and developing Web
  applications. It also describes the event methods and interfaces available
  for creating components that can be accessed by ASP or ISAPI extensions. The
  SDK also contains information on how to store your custom IIS configuration
  data and how you can use built-in objects to manipulate that data, and how
  you can log server activity. Also, the SDK provides a library of script and
  program samples that demonstrate a variety of ways to interact with IIS
  programmatically.

Debugging:

NOTE: Debug Symbol files (symbols) are required to do both kernel and user-mode
debugging in Windows NT. Symbols provide a way to resolve global variables and
function names in the loaded executable file.

Symbols are produced by the linker when a program is built. They are removed from
the retail product and saved in a separate (.dbg) file. This considerably
reduces file size, which decreases file load time and therefore increases system
performance. Symbols represent Function/API names and global variables.

- Windows 2000 symbols: The symbols used by IIS are included in the Windows
  2000 symbols, which are available at the following locations:

   - The "Customer Support and Diagnostics Tools" CD, which is included with
     Windows 2000 Server and Advanced Server.

   - http://www.microsoft.com/Windows2000/downloads/otherdownloads/symbols/download.asp

- Platform SDK Windows 2000 Debuggers
  (http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/default.asp?URL=/code/topic.asp?URL=/MSDN-FILES/028/000/015/topic.xml):
  Windows 2000 Debuggers contain a graphical debugger you can use to debug
  Microsoft Win32-based applications. On Microsoft Windows NT or Windows 2000,
  you can also use the debuggers to debug kernel-mode drivers. The Windows 2000
  Debuggers are included in the Platform Software Development Kit (SDK) and the
  Windows 2000 Driver Development Kit (DDK).

- Microsoft Windows NT and Windows 2000 Debugging Resources
  (http://www.microsoft.com/hwdev/driver/ntdebugging.htm)
  This package is also included in both the Platform SDK and the Windows 2000
  DDK. Both the SDK and DDK are both available through MSDN. This also includes
  links to the following resources:

   - The Microsoft Debugging Tools Knowledge Base Articles are a collection of
     Product Support articles that are relevant to debugging.

   - The Resources for Microsoft Debugging Tools page is a collection of
     pointers to various resources, from Microsoft and from other third
     parties, that may be useful to those who are interested in debugging.

   - The OEM Support Tools Phase 3 Service is another debugger package to
     investigate. It currently contains a few tools which aren't included in
     the normal debugger package.
