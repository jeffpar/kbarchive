The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

As of the release of Service Pack 2 for Microsoft Systems Management Server
(SMS) 2.0, the versions of the individual client components are not identical
for all platforms.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a Service Pack is applied to a site, all of the client components are
updated with new files and a new version number. This version number is stored
in the Compver.ini file that is stored along with each of the component's files.
The Compver.ini files for each component can be found in the following
locations:

  Client Base Components     - SMS\Inboxes\clicomp.src\base\compver.ini
  Hardware Inventory         - SMS\Inboxes\clicomp.src\hinv\compver.ini
  License Metering           - SMS\Inboxes\clicomp.src\licmtr\compver.ini
  Remote Control             - SMS\Inboxes\clicomp.src\remctrl\compver.ini
  Software Inventory         - SMS\Inboxes\clicomp.src\sinv\compver.ini
  Available Programs Manager - SMS\Inboxes\clicomp.src\smsapm32\compver.ini
  Event to Trap(SNMP)        - SMS\Inboxes\clicomp.src\snmpelea\compver.ini
  Software Distribution      - SMS\Inboxes\clicomp.src\swdist\compver.ini
  Windows Management(WBEM)   - SMS\Inboxes\clicomp.src\wbem\compver.ini

SMS 2.0 implements a method of file version tracking using the Compver.ini files
in each component. If the version that currently exists on the client is equal
to or later than the version on the client access point (CAP), which is by
default on the site server, the client does not upgrade its component files.
However, if the version on the client is earlier than that of the site server,
the client receives updated files on the next Client Configuration Installation
Manager (CCIM) polling interval.

The version numbers for each component are presented in this format

  2.00.1493.2000

where:

- 2.xx.xxxx.xxxx represents the full version revision of the product.

- x.00.xxxx.xxxx represents the minor version revision of the product.

- x.xx.1493.xxxx represents the build number of the particular version.

- x.xx.xxxx.2000 represents the Service Pack release number as well as a minor
  build or revision and it is generally component specific.

  NOTE: This is where the service pack level is determined. If the number reads
  0000, the installation is the initial version of SMS 2.0. If it is 1000, the
  site has Service Pack 1 installed. If the number is 2000, Service Pack 2 has
  been applied. If the number is 3000, Service Pack 3 has been applied.

  NOTE: The last four digits represent several different conditions such as the
  International Client Pack (ICP) version and hotfix levels as well as the
  Service Pack.

For additional information about the ICP levels, click the article number below
to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q213410 Determining Version and Build Number

In general, when any of the last three digits of the file segment change, it is
understood that a new component version has been applied, such as the
installation of a hotfix.

These are the starting versions for each of the client components as of the

of future hotfixes. When you are troubleshooting client version errors, also
check for the Compver.ini on the CAPs. The component specific Compver.ini files
are located in the following directories on the CAP:

  Client Base Components     - CAP_***\clicomp.box\base\compver.ini
  Hardware Inventory         - CAP_***\clicomp.box\hinv\compver.ini
  License Metering           - CAP_***\clicomp.box\licmtr\compver.ini
  Remote Control             - CAP_***\clicomp.box\remctrl\compver.ini
  Software Inventory         - CAP_***\clicomp.box\sinv\compver.ini
  Available Programs Manager - CAP_***\clicomp.box\smsapm32\compver.ini
  Event to Trap(SNMP)        - CAP_***\clicomp.box\snmpelea\compver.ini
  Software Distribution      - CAP_***\clicomp.box\swdist\compver.ini
  Windows Management(WBEM)   - CAP_***\clicomp.box\wbem\compver.ini

If you are troubleshooting version conflicts from the client side, open Control
Panel, and then run the Systems Management applet. The component versions are
listed on the Components tab.
