SUMMARY
=======

This article shows how to programmatically set which printer is the system
default printer. Not all applications or components can select a specific
printer to use. This often makes it necessary to change the default printer for
the system so that the application or component will use the desired printer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: This code changes the default printer for the entire system. So all
applications that do not specify a printer, even applications that are currently
running, use this same default. For this reason, you may want to have your code
remember the previous default and then set it back when your print job is
finished.

The following code sample provides a means to determine which printers are
available, and to designate one as the system default printer.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
  default.

2. Add a new module to the project and insert the following code:

  Public Const HWND_BROADCAST = &amp;HFFFF
  Public Const WM_WININICHANGE = &amp;H1A

  ' constants for DEVMODE structure
  Public Const CCHDEVICENAME = 32
  Public Const CCHFORMNAME = 32

  ' constants for DesiredAccess member of PRINTER_DEFAULTS
  Public Const STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED = &amp;HF0000
  Public Const PRINTER_ACCESS_ADMINISTER = &amp;H4
  Public Const PRINTER_ACCESS_USE = &amp;H8
  Public Const PRINTER_ALL_ACCESS = (STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED Or _
  PRINTER_ACCESS_ADMINISTER Or PRINTER_ACCESS_USE)

  ' constant that goes into PRINTER_INFO_5 Attributes member
  ' to set it as default
  Public Const PRINTER_ATTRIBUTE_DEFAULT = 4

  ' Constant for OSVERSIONINFO.dwPlatformId
  Public Const VER_PLATFORM_WIN32_WINDOWS = 1

  Public Type OSVERSIONINFO
      dwOSVersionInfoSize As Long
      dwMajorVersion As Long
      dwMinorVersion As Long
      dwBuildNumber As Long
      dwPlatformId As Long
      szCSDVersion As String * 128
  End Type

  Public Type DEVMODE

       dmDefaultSource As Integer
       dmPrintQuality As Integer
       dmColor As Integer
       dmDuplex As Integer
       dmYResolution As Integer
       dmTTOption As Integer
       dmCollate As Integer
       dmFormName As String * CCHFORMNAME
       dmLogPixels As Integer
       dmBitsPerPel As Long
       dmPelsWidth As Long
       dmPelsHeight As Long
       dmDisplayFlags As Long
       dmDisplayFrequency As Long
       dmICMMethod As Long        ' // Windows 95 only
       dmICMIntent As Long        ' // Windows 95 only
       dmMediaType As Long        ' // Windows 95 only
       dmDitherType As Long       ' // Windows 95 only
       dmReserved1 As Long        ' // Windows 95 only
       dmReserved2 As Long        ' // Windows 95 only
  End Type

  Public Type PRINTER_INFO_5
       pPrinterName As String

              Exit For
              End If

3. Place a ListBox and a CommandButton on Form1.

4. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Form1:

5. Run the project and note that the preceding code populates a ListBox with all
  available printers.

6. Select one printer in the list and make it the default by clicking the
  CommandButton.

7. Confirm that the default printer has changed: On the Start button, select
  Settings, select Printers, and then check which printer is marked as the
  default. Alternatively, you can print to the default printer from any
  application on your system.
