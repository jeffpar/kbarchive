-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Netlogon service performs a variety of actions on all Windows NT 4.0-based
domain member servers, and additional functions on domain controllers. This
article describes basic operations for domain servers, workstations, and domain
controllers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Member Servers and Workstations
-------------------------------

Netlogon performs similar functions on Windows NT 4.0-based member servers and
workstations. Netlogon has the following responsibilities:

- Locate a domain controller with which to set up a secure channel
- Retrieve a list of users when adding permissions
- Non-local (domain) account authentication
- Change the machine account password

NOTE: The terms "workstation" and "member server" are used interchangeably in
this article.

Secure Channel:

Upon starting, Netlogon attempts to find a domain controller (DC) for the domain
in which its machine account exists. After locating the appropriate DC, the
machine account password from the workstation is authenticated against the
password on the DC. After the machine account is verified, the workstation
establishes a secure channel with that DC.

Secure channels are not stagnant. Netlogon routinely checks the status and
responsiveness of the secure channel. If the secure channel partner does not
meet certain criteria, Netlogon attempts to find a new secure channel partner.
If at this point a domain controller cannot be found, you may see the following
error message in the System log in Event Viewer:

  Event ID 5719

If a machine account cannot be found, you may see the following error message in
the System log in Event Viewer:

  Event ID 5721

If the password does not match, you may see the following error message in the
System log in Event Viewer:

  Event ID 3210

Retrieving a List of Users for Permissions:

When you attempt to add users to a list of permissions, such as adding a user to
the permissions for a file, Netlogon is responsible for pulling the list from
its secure channel partner. However, if your user list is large and your secure
channel partner is located over a slow link, there may be a significant delay in
displaying permissions because the list is not displayed until the entire list
is retrieved.

Non-Local Domain Authentication
-------------------------------

When you log on locally or attempt to establish a network connection to a
workstation, Netlogon can play a role in the authentication. During a logon
attempt, Local Security Authority (LSA) receives the credentials offered. If the
credentials that are provided are not part of the workstation's local Security
Accounts Manager (SAM), Netlogon forwards the credentials to its secure channel
partner. That DC then attempts to validate the credentials and responds back to
the workstation. Netlogon then passes the return information back to LSA, which
permits or denies the logon attempt.

Machine Account Passwords
-------------------------

Netlogon is also responsible for changing the machine account password. By
default, this password is reset every seven days. The workstation sends the
request to the secure channel partner. The secure channel partner passes the
request to the PDC. If the response from the PDC is no "access denied" or
"refusepasswordchange," the Netlogon service considers the password change
successful. Netlogon remembers the last password as well as the new password. If
the machine account is not validated when it is setting up a secure channel
using the new password, Netlogon attempts to use the old password, and if
successful, uses only the old password from this point on.

Domain Controllers
------------------

In addition to the workstation and member server responsibilities listed earlier
in this article, Netlogon manages the following additional tasks on domain
controllers:

- Secure channel
- Domain and pass-through authentication
- Machine account and trust relationship password changes
- SAM database synchronization

NOTE: Netlogon functions vary based on whether the DC is a PDC or a backup domain
controller (BDC).

Secure Channels:

When you start a PDC, Netlogon builds a list of all the BDCs in the domain, and a
list of trusted domains. At this time, Netlogon attempts to set up a secure
channel with a DC from each trusted domain, and if this attempt does not
succeed, Netlogon does not make another attempt until a secure channel with that
domain is explicitly needed.

The BDC's behavior is similar. While Netlogon on a BDC does not enumerate other
BDCs, it does contact the PDC and sets up secure channels with trusted domains
as needed.

Pass-Through Authentication:

Secure channels with other domains are used for pass-through authentication. For
example, if domain A trusts domain B, and a workstation is a member of domain A,
at startup Netlogon tries to locate a DC for domain A. After a DC is located,
the machine account password from the workstation is authenticated against the
password on the DC in domain A. After the machine account is verified, the
workstation establishes a secure channel with that DC. If a user from domain A
or domain B attempts to log on to the workstation, LSA determines that this
needs to be handled by Netlogon. Netlogon on the workstation passes the
credentials to its secure channel partner. If the account does not exist in
domain A, the secure channel partner (the DC in domain A) uses its secure
channel to domain B to pass the credentials to that DC. The DC in domain B
responds to the DC in domain A, which passes the information back to the
workstation. Note that Netlogon handles the authentication process on all three
computers.

Trust Account Passwords:

The Netlogon service on the PDC manages the trust relationship passwords, and
this process is very similar to the machine account password process. Once the
trust is setup or changed, the PDC passes the trust information to the BDCs
during SAM account replication.

  Q128489 Inter-Domain Trust Account Passwords

SAM Synchronization:

The major role that Netlogon plays on domain controllers is in SAM
synchronization. Only the PDC has a writeable copy of the SAM (with the
exception of Last Logon Time), and all changes that are made to the SAM need to
be written to the BDCs. Any change to a user, group, machine account, trust, and
so on, is recorded on the PDC.

The Netlogon service on the PDC records each change to the Netlogon.chg file. The
Netlogon.chg file has three sections: SAM, Built-in, and LSA, and each section
has its own serial number. Every change that is recorded in the change log
updates the serial number in the appropriate section. Each BDC maintains a list
of the three serial numbers from the last synchronization.

Netlogon manages this process. By default, if there are changes, the PDC sends a
"pulse" message every 5 minutes to all BDCs. When a BDC receives a "pulse"
message, it contacts the PDC and then compares each of the serial numbers. If
the serial numbers do not match, the BDC requests the changes made since the
synchronization, and this process is known as a partial synchronization.

If the change log filled up and restarted (wrapped), the BDC requests a full
synchronization. By default, the change log holds about 2,000 changes. Usually,
you should not wrap the change log, but adding accounts by using the Portuas
utility (the LAN Manager upgrade utility) or by scripting can cause the change
log to wrap.

When synchronization is complete, the BDC sets its serial numbers to the same
serial number as the PDC. If no changes are made, there are no pulses, and the
BDC performs periodic checks to verify that the PDC is still available. Note
that no synchronization occurs if the BDC determines that the serial numbers
match.

Netlogon on the domain controllers manages the size of the change log, the
frequency rate of the "pulse" messages, and the number of BDCs that can
synchronize at one time.
