The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0

SUMMARY
=======

Although you may prefer to perform queries for ranges of Transmission Control
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) addresses or subnets, the queries created
tend to return unexpected data. This behavior occurs because the data is stored
in the database as a variable character (VarChar) without a numeric value.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sample Scenario
---------------

Set up the following query statement:

  MICROSOFT|NETWORK|1.0:IP Address is greater than or equal to '148.108.120.0'
  AND MICROSOFT|NETWORK|1.0:IP Address is less than or equal to '148.108.135.255'

You would expect this query to return clients on networks between 148.108.120,
121, 122 through 135. However, the results that you receive contain addresses
such as 148.108.13.1, 148.108.13.2, and so forth, which are not in the expected
range.

Reason for failure:

Because the IP Address is stored in the database as a VarChar, as opposed to a
numeric value, it is read differently. With a number, both SMS and SQL read from
right to left to determine the size of the number for the query. With a
character string, SMS and SQL read from left to right. Consequently, when you
perform a query looking for a value between two strings, it has unexpected
results. For example, in the "Sample Scenario" above, it would return everything
from 12, 120 to 129, and 13, 130 to 135.

Possible Workaround:

- Include the following "exclusions" in the query:

  AND MICROSOFT|NETWORK|1.0:IP Address is not like '148.108.12.%'
  AND MICROSOFT|NETWORK|1.0:IP Address is not like '148.108.13.%'

- Use the Default Gateway field for the query instead of a TCP/IP range. By
  doing so, you can base your query on a specific address instead of on a range
  of addresses.
