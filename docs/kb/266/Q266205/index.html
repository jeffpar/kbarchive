The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Exchange Server, when you send a message and request delivery and
read receipts, you may not receive a message, and a non-delivery report (NDR)
may not be generated.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if you configured the Internet Mail Service in the
following way:

- The Transfer mode is set to Inbound Only.

  -and-

- The Internet Mail Service address space has been removed from the routing
  table.

When an Internet message with a delivery or read receipt request is accepted and
processed by an Internet Mail Service configured in this way, the generated
receipt gets trapped in the MTS-OUT queue and is not delivered.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, configure the Internet Mail Service Transfer mode to
"Inbound and Outbound", and set the Internet Mail Service to forward all
messages to an Internet Mail Service in your organization that is configured for
outbound mail.
