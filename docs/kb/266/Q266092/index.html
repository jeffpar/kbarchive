SYMPTOMS
========

When you send an e-mail message that contains a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet as
an attachment, you may receive a non-delivery report (NDR) similar to the
following:

  Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

     Subject:	FW:
     Sent:	6/13/00 10:54 AM

  The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

     'ldolce@actium.com' on 6/13/00 11:00 AM
  The content length of the message is too long for the recipient to take delivery.
  The MTS-ID of the original message is: c=US;a=;p=MPS;l=JAXN047-000613145408Z-56596
           MSEXCH:IMS:MPS:NAmerica:JAXN024 3903 (000B099C)&lt;BR/&gt;
  Message exceeds size limit.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Excel attachment contains macros. Macros are
expanded when they go through the Internet Mail Service. If the Internet Mail
Service has a message size restriction and the attachment is close to that size,
when you send the message, the attachment may be expanded to a size that is too
large to pass through the Internet Mail Service. For example, if you have an
attachment that is 8 MB and your message size restriction is 10 MB, once the
message is expanded, it will be approximately 11 MB. The Internet Mail Service
rejects the message.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, increase the message size limit on the Internet Mail
Service. To do this:

1. Open Microsoft Exchange Administrator.

2. Click to expand Site, click Configuration, and then double-click Connections.

3. Double-click "Internet Mail Service", and then click Properties.

4. On the General tab, increase the message size limit to accommodate this
  message.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, you may also zip the attachment and send it.
