-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article shows you how to create, package, and deploy a Distributed
Component Object Model (DCOM) client/server application by using Visual Basic.
To create a DCOM client/server application, you need the Enterprise Edition of
Visual Basic. Microsoft assumes that the reader is already familiar with
creating client/server applications that run on the same computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You do not need to change your code to enable a client application to
instantiate a remote server by using DCOM. The difference is the way in which
you package and deploy the client. In addition, there are some security settings
you need to make after the client and the server are installed. You can make
these settings by using an utility called Dcomcnfg.

The following steps show you how to distribute and configure a simple
client/server application. Name the server DCOMDemo_Svr, and name the client
DCOMDemo_Cli. Create a separate folder for each of them. For the purpose of this
article, call these folders c:\DCOMDemo\Server and c:\DCOMDemo\Client.

Create the Server
-----------------

1. Start a new Visual Basic Project. On the New Project dialog box, select
  ActiveX EXE, and then click Open. Class1 is created by default.

2. Add the following code to the Class1 module:

  Public Function ServerTime() As String
      ServerTime = Time
  End Function

3. On the Project menu, click the Project Properties option, and then select the
  General tab.

4. In the Project Name field, type in "DCOMDemo_Svr" (without the quotation
  marks).

5. On the Project Description field, type in "DCOMDemo_Svr - Server" (without
  the quotation marks). Check the Unattended Execution option.

  NOTE: This option should always be checked in servers that don't have any UI
  to assure that no dialog boxes of any type are displayed while the server is
  running. If you have any type of user interaction while your server is
  running under an identity that is not the Interactive User, your server may
  appear to hang.

6. Select the Component tab, and check the Remote Server Files option.

  NOTE: Checking this option makes the Visual Basic compiler generate the VBR
  and TLB files needed for packaging the client applications that use this
  server. These files contain registry entries that need to be included on the
  client computer.

7. Close the Project Properties dialog box.

8. On the File menu, select Save As, and then save this project to the
  c:\DCOMDemo\Server folder.

9. On the File menu, select Make DCOMDemo_Svr and compile the server.

10. On the Project menu, select the Project Properties option, and then select
  the Component tab.

11. On the Component tab, select Version Compatibility, select the Binary
  Compatibility option, and then make the project binary compatible with the
  server's executable file you just created (DCOMDemo_Svr.exe). By selecting
  this option you are assuring that all GUIDs are kept the same if you
  recompile the server.

Create the Client
-----------------

1. On the File menu, select the New Project option, select Standard EXE, and
  then click OK. Form1 is created by default.

2. On the Project menu, click the Project Properties option, and then select the
  General tab.

3. In the Project Name field, type in "DCOMDemo_Cli" (without the quotation
  marks).

4. In the Project Description field, type in "DCOMDemo_Cli Project - Client"
  (without the quotation marks).

5. On the Project menu, select References. From the list of available
  references, select DCOMDemo_Svr - Server.

6. Place a command button on Form1, and change the button's caption to Run.

7. Place the following code in the button's click event:

      Dim MyObj As DCOMDemo_Svr.Class1
      
      On Error GoTo err1
      
      Set MyObj = CreateObject("DCOMDemo_Svr.Class1")
      MsgBox "Server Time=" &amp; MyObj.ServerTime &amp; "  Client Time=" &amp; Time
      
      Exit Sub
  err1:
      MsgBox "Connection failed: Error " &amp; Err.Number &amp; " - " &amp; Err.Description

8. On the File menu, select Save As, and then save the project to the client's
  folder c:\DCOMDemo\Client.

9. Press the F5 key to run the client in the IDE and test it out.

10. On the File menu, select Make DCOMDemo_Cli to compile the client, and then
  close Visual Basic.

Package the Server
------------------

Use the Package and Deployment Wizard to package your server for distribution as
usual. The server is instantiated by a remote client using DCOM. While creating
the package for your server, you get a dialog box asking you if this server will
be used as a Remote Automation server and if you want to include support files
for this purpose. Just click the No button, because DCOM is not Remote
Automation. Remote Automation is an older technology that was replaced by DCOM.

Package the Client
------------------

When packaging the client there are some specific steps that need to be taken,
considering that the server does not run on the same computer as the client. The
changes made to the client's package assure that just the type library (.tlb
file) is installed and some additional registry entries are included instead of
the server's executable, which is not necessary on the client's computer because
it's not going to run there.

Package the client by using the following steps:

1. Start Package and Deployment Wizard, and then select the Client's project.

2. Click the Package button. In the Package Type dialog box, select Standard
  Setup Package, and then click Next.

3. In the Package Folder dialog box, select the folder to store the package, and
  then click Next. In this case, it is c:\DCOMDemo\Client\Package.

  NOTE: You may get a dialog box saying that there is no dependency information
  for the server. Click OK because this server doesn't have any dependencies.

  You should now be in the Included Files dialog box.

4. Deselect the server's executable file, DCOMDemo_Svr.exe, because you do note
  want to distribute the server's executable, and then click the Add button.

5. Change the Files of Type combo box to Remote Server Files (*.vbr).

6. Point to the folder where you have your Server's project (in this case
  c:\DCOMDemo\Server), and select the related VBR file, DCOMDemo_Svr.VBR. Click
  Open, and the Add File dialog box closes. Notice that two files are included,
  DCOMDemo_Svr.VBR and DCOMDemo_Svr.TLB. Click the Next button.

  NOTE: In the Remote Servers dialog box you can define the name of the computer
  (Net Address) where the server is running. Usually you keep this field blank
  because you may not know in advance where the server will be installed. If
  you keep it blank, you are prompted for it when you install the client. For
  this sample, keep it blank.

7. Click Next to proceed. You can now proceed with the standard procedures for
  Package and Deployment Wizard. In this case, just click Next to all remaining
  dialog boxes

Install the Server
------------------

Install the server on the computer on which you would like to run it, using the
distribution package you created earlier. If you want to use your development
computer to run the server, you don't need to install it because Visual Basic
makes the registration for you when it compiles the server.

Install the Client
------------------

Install the Client on the computer on which you would like to run it, using the
distribution package you created earlier. Because this client uses a DCOM server
and you left the actual location of the server blank when you created the
distribution package, you now need to provide this location. When Setup prompts
you for this location, provide the name of the computer where you installed the
server.

Set the Server's Security
-------------------------

If you installed the server on a Microsoft Windows NT or Microsoft Windows 2000
computer, you need to configure security for it. Do this by using Dcomcnfg, as
shown in the following steps, which assume that both client and server computers
are part of a domain, and the user logged on to the client computer is logged on
as a domain user. The suggested settings are just one possible configuration.
They are very generic and give wide access to the server. Remember that this is
just an example. When you deploy your real applications, and security is a
concern for your environment, you should select more restrictive options. Also,
if the computer you are using to test this example server is used to run other
servers, make a note of the current settings before you make the following
changes, and return to the original settings as soon as you are done with your
tests.

1. On the server computer, click the Start button, and then select Run. In the
  Run dialog box, type "Dcomcnfg" (without the quotation marks), and then click
  OK. You need to have Administrator rights to be able to run Dcomcnfg.

2. Select the Default Properties tab, and verify that Enable Distributed COM on
  this computer is checked.

3. Set the Default Authentication Level to Connect, and set the Default
  Impersonation Level to Identify.

4. Select the Default Security tab.

5. Click the Edit Default button in the Default Access Permissions panel.

6. Verify that Everyone and System are included in the list with Allow Access
  rights. If they are not, you can use the Add button to add them to the list.
  Click OK when the list is complete.

7. Click the Edit Default button in the Default Launch Permissions panel.

8. Verify that Everyone and System are included in the list with Allow Launch
  permissions. If they are not, use the Add button to add them to the list.
  Click OK when the list is complete.

9. Select the Applications tab, highlight your server, DCOMDemo_Svr.Class1, and
  then click the Properties button.

10. Select the General tab, set the Authentication Level to Default, and then
  select the Location tab. The only option that is checked should be Run
  application on this computer.

11. Select the Security tab and verify that the Use default access permissions
  and the Use default launch permissions options are checked.

12. Select the Identity tab, check The launching user option, click OK to close
  the Server's Properties dialog box, and then click OK again to close
  Dcomcnfg.

As you can see, the test server uses all of the default settings. When deploying
your own servers, you should define settings specific to your application. All
custom settings take precedence over the default ones.

You are now ready to test your server. On the client computer, launch the client,
and then click the Run button. You should see a message box indicating the
server's time. If you are unable to test this sample successfully, please see
the troubleshooting article, Q269330, listed in the "References" section.
