-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After a Visual FoxPro (VFP) 7.0 application is distributed to a computer that
does not have VFP 7.0 installed, HTML Help files do not open when accessed from
inside the application.

CAUSE
=====

The files FoxHHelp7.exe and FoxHHelpPS7.dll are required in order for HTML Help
to work from a distributed VFP 7.0 application.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you are using "InstallShield Express - Visual FoxPro Limited Edition" to
install your application, add FoxHHelp7.exe and FoxHHelpPS7.dll in step 2 of the
install project. These files should be installed on the development computer in
the \Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\VFP folder. If you do not want
to keep them with your application files, you can place them in
[CommonFilesFolder]\Microsoft Shared\VFP.

If you are copying the files manually, after bringing them over you need to run
the command FoxHHelp7 /regserver on the new computer to put the proper entries
in the registry.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a Visual FoxPro 7.0 application that uses HTML Help.

2. Install the application on a computer that has not had VFP 7.0 installed on
  it.

3. Try to use Help from the application. You will find that nothing happens.

The Microsoft Visual FoxPro HTML Help Support Library merge module which ships
with InstallShield Express contains the files needed for calling HTML Help from
VFP 6.0 applications. Including the merge module (MSM) with a VFP 7.0
application has no effect.

the "InstallShield Express - Visual FoxPro Limited Edition" Help files as well
as the article "Walkthrough: Creating a Visual FoxPro Application Setup Program
Using InstallShield Express" on the VFP 7.0 CD.
