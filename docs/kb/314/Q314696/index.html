-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you shut down a backup domain controller that communicates with a Windows
Internet Name Service (WINS) server over a wide area network (WAN), the
domain&lt;1C&gt; name may sometimes enter a conflicting state. This behavior may
occur if you run Windows NT 4.0-based domain controllers in a WAN environment
that uses central WINS servers. When this problem occurs, the following
information is logged on the backup domain controllers:

  Event Type: Error
  Event Source: NetBT
  Event Category: None
  Event ID: 4320
  Date: 11.10.2001
  Time: 12:42:17
  User: N/A
  Computer: N0001009
  Description:
  Another machine has sent a name release message to this machine probably
  because a duplicate name has been detected on the TCP network. The IP address
  of the node that sent the message is in the data. Use nbtstat -n in a command
  window to see which name is in the Conflict state.

  Data:
  0000: 00040000 00540001 00000000 c00010e0
  0010: 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
  0020: 00000000 00000000 0168fc82

CAUSE
=====

The server incorrectly determines that the name is in conflict when it receives
the name-release message from WINS because the server does not check the name
type.
