-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Streets and Trips 2001 
- Microsoft MapPoint 2001 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use Microsoft Streets &amp; Trips or Microsoft MapPoint, you
may receive an error message similar to the following:

  Your registry settings for this application were not copied correctly. To
  correct these settings, run setup again for this application from the
  location where you originally installed it.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when the installation is not completed successfully.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps in the order in which they are
presented.

Uninstall the Program
---------------------

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

3. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click the program, and then click Add/Remove.

4. Follow the prompts to uninstall the program.

Start Your Computer with a Clean-Boot Procedure
-----------------------------------------------

Use the appropriate method for your version of Microsoft Windows.

Microsoft Windows XP:

For additional information about how to clean boot in Windows XP, click the
article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q310353 How to Perform a Clean Boot in Windows XP

Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition (Me):

1. Click Start, click Run, type "msconfig" (without the quotation marks) in the
  Open box, and then click OK.

2. On the General tab, click "Selective startup".

3. Click to clear all of the check boxes under "Selective startup".

4. On the "Startup" tab, click to select the *StateMgr check box.


5. Click OK. When you are prompted to restart your computer, click Yes. After
  the computer restarts, Click Start, click Run, type "msconfig" (without the
  quotation marks) in the Open box, and then click OK.

  IMPORTANT: Examine the General tab to make sure that the check boxes that you
  cleared are still cleared. If none of the check boxes are selected, proceed
  to the next method. If you see a selected, unavailable check box (it appears
  dimmed and has a check mark in it), your computer is not truly clean-booted
  and you may require assistance from the manufacturer of the program that is
  listed next to the selected, unavailable check box.

Microsoft Windows 98:

1. Click Start, click Run, type "msconfig.exe" (without the quotation marks) in
  the Open box, and then click OK.

2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the
  following check boxes:

   - Process Config.sys File

   - Process Autoexec.bat File

   - Process Winstart.bat File (if available)

   - Process System.ini File

   - Process Win.ini File

   - Load Startup Group Items

3. Click OK, and then restart your computer when you are prompted to do so.

Microsoft Windows 95:

1. Restart your computer. When the Starting Windows 95 dialog box is displayed,
  press F8, and then choose Step-By-Step Confirmation from the Startup menu.

2. When you are prompted, load the following items (if you are prompted to load
  any other items, press N):

   - Dblspace driver.

   - Himem.sys.

   - Ifshlp.sys.

   - Dblbuff.sys.

   - Windows 95 graphical user interface (GUI); choose to load all Windows
     drivers.

NOTE: Windows 95 does not require the Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files, but some
tools installed on the computer may require them. You should never rename the
Config.sys and Autoexec.bat files until you perform a successful interactive
boot to verify that they are not needed.
