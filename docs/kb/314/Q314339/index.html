-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A denial of service vulnerability exists in Internet Information Server (IIS)
4.0, Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0, and IIS 5.1. By exploiting this
vulnerability, an attacker can temporarily prevent a Web server from providing
Web services.

This vulnerability does not allow any data on the system to be compromised, nor
does it enable the attacker to gain any rights on the system.

Microsoft investigations to date suggest that this vulnerability only occurs in
cases in which Front Page Server Extensions (FPSE) are installed on the system,
although it is possible that it may also occur under other conditions.

CAUSE
=====

This vulnerability occurs because IIS incorrectly handles the error condition
that results when one of the ISAPI filters that FPSE installs receives a Uniform
Resource Locator (URL) that exceeds the maximum permitted length. Although the
problem is with IIS, and therefore can also occur in cases that involve
additional Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI) filters,
Microsoft investigations to date have not revealed any other cases in which this
occurs.

RESOLUTION
