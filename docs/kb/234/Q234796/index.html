SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to link a web page to a particular worksheet in an
Excel workbook.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you create a link to an Excel workbook, it will open by default to the last
worksheet that was viewed. To create a link to a specific worksheet follow these
steps:

1. Open the workbook to the worksheet you want to link to. Click to select cell
  A1.

2. On the Insert menu, point to Name, and click Define.

3. Type a name that contains only letters and numbers. Click OK.

4. Save the workbook into the FrontPage web by clicking Save on the File menu.

5. Open a Web in FrontPage Explorer, and double-click the page you want the
  hyperlink to appear on.

6. Select the text or image you want to create a hyperlink for.

7. On the Insert menu, click Hyperlink.

8. In the Hyperlink dialog box, browse to the Excel workbook created earlier,
  and click to select it.

9. In the URL box, put your insertion point after (workbook).xls and type
  #(name), where (name) represents the name you defined in step two.

For example, if the workbook you created was entitled 'Workbook' and the Name you
defined in step two was 'worksheet', the URL line would read:
Workbook.xls#worksheet

10. Click OK. On the File menu, click Save.

Note: Additional links can be created in a single worksheet. Repeat the previous
steps replacing cell A1 in step one with the cell you would like to link to.
