SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the transfer of software inventory from a secondary site
server to its primary site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The software inventory process on a secondary site is performed differently than
on a primary site because the secondary site server does not have a Software
Inventory Processor.

When the Software Inventory Processor is run on a workstation, a Software
Inventory file is created with an extension of either .sic or .sid. A complete
Software Inventory file has the .sic extension, whereas a Software Inventory
file that only includes changes to a previous inventory has the .sid extension.

On a secondary site, the Software Inventory file is copied to the
\\&lt;Server&gt;\CAP_&lt;Sitecode&gt;\Sinv.box folder on the client access point
(CAP). The Inbox Manager Assistant moves the file from the CAP to the
\Sms\Inboxes\Sinv.box folder on the site server. Then, the Software Inventory
files are collected by the Software Inventory Processor and sent to the
Replication Manager for replication to the primary site.

The Software Inventory Processor at a secondary site server operates on a one
hour cycle. During this cycle, the Software Inventory Processor scans the
\Sms\Inboxes\Sinv.box folder. The Software Inventory Processor is also activated
when a No History MIF (NHM) file is copied to the \Sms\Inboxes\Inventry.box
folder.

NOTE: The Software Inventory Processor does not write any log entries when it
processes Software Inventory files.

When Software Inventory files are replicated from the secondary site to the
primary site, the files lose their date or time stamp: files from each
replication process all receive the same time stamp.

On the primary site server, the Software Inventory Processor processes the .sic
files before it processes the .sid files. If the software inventory schedule for
client computers at the secondary site is configured so that several .sid files
are generated for one computer before the replication process occurs, and the
.sid files are received at the primary site, a more recent .sid file can be
processed before an earlier file, which can cause the earlier file to be
discarded. The Software Inventory Processor can create a Management Information
Format (MIF) file from a successfully processed .sic or .sid file.

The Inventory Dataloader component at the parent site processes the resulting MIF
file that is passed to it from the Software Inventory Processor, which updates
the inventory contents and its history. However, a secondary site does not have
the Inventory Dataloader component.

An example of the logging entries that are logged in the Sinvproc.log file on the
parent site server:

on the workstation.
