-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If this article does not describe your hardware-related issue, please see the following Microsoft Web site to view more articles about hardware: 

  http://support.microsoft.com/support/windows/topics/hardware/hwddresctr.asp

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install the video drivers included with the Diamond Fire GL 1000 Pro
video adapter on a Microsoft Windows 98-based computer, your computer may stop
responding (hang) or you may receive an error message similar to the following:

  Invalid VxD dynamic link call from VPOWERD(06) + 00000BD9 to device VMCPD
  Service C.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the Diamond Fire GL 1000 Pro installation program
updates the version of the Vmcpd.vxd file to version 1413 without checking the
installed version of the file. This can happen with Voodoo 5 drivers, as well as
others from other vendors.

NOTE: Removing the driver and installing another video driver does not resolve
this issue.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the DirectX Diagnostic Tool (Dxdiag.exe) to determine
if the version of the Vmcpd.vxd file installed on your computer is version
1413.

For additional information about how to use the DirectX Diagnostic Tool, click
the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q190900 DirectX: Description of the DirectX Diagnostic Tool

If the version of the Vmcpd.vxd file is 1413, replace this file with the version
shipped with Windows 98. To do this:

1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click "Files or Folders".

2. In the Named box, type "vmpcd.vxd" (without the quotation marks).

3. In the Look In box, click My Computer, and then click Find Now.

4. In the list of found files, right-click the Vmcpd.vxd file located in the
  Windows\System folder, and then click Rename.

5. Type "vmcpd.old" (without the quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

6. Close the Find: Files Named Vmpcd.vxd window.

7. Restart the computer.

8. Insert the Windows 98 CD-ROM into your CD-ROM drive. Press and hold down the
  SHIFT key as you insert the CD-ROM to prevent the Windows CD-ROM from
  starting automatically.

9. Click Start, and then click Run.

10. In the Open box, type the following line, and then click OK:

  sfc.exe

11. Click "Extract one file from installation disk."

12. In the "Specify the system file you would like to restore" box, type
  "vmcpd.vxd" (without the quotation marks), andthen click Start.

13. In the Restore From box, type the following line, and then click OK:

  &lt;cd-rom&gt;:\Win98

  where &lt;cd-rom&gt; is the drive letter of your CD-ROM drive.

14. In the Save File In box, type the following line, and then click OK:

  &lt;drive&gt;:\Windows\System\Vmm32

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter of the hard disk on which Windows is
  installed.
