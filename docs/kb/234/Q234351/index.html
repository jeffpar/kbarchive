The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a program that attempts to gain access to a performance counter
that has not been installed, your computer's performance may degrade or the
computer may stop responding (hang) because of a memory leak. For example, if
you use the Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 Healthmon tool on a
computer that does not have the Microsoft Simple Network Management Protocol
(SNMP) configured, the computer may hang and you may be required to restart your
computer periodically.

This problem may also occur if any application, such as system management
products, tries to access performance counters on the computer in question.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because memory is not being deallocated correctly when an
attempt is made to write data to the corresponding performance counter that is
not available. It may be necessary for you to determine which performance
counters your program is attempting to update to ensure their availability.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT Server or Workstation 4.0
------------------------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or the
individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
pack, please go to:

4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, install the SNMP service on your computer. To do
this:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
  Network.

2. On the Services tab, click Add, and then double-click SNMP Service.

3. When you are prompted, type the full path to the installation files folder
  (for example, D:\I386), click Continue, and then click Close.

4. Reinstall the latest Windows NT 4.0 service pack, and then restart the
  computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are using the Healthmon tool and you have already installed Windows NT
4.0 Service Pack 4 with the SMS hotfix, you may also experience this problem.
