-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you migrate users from Lotus cc:Mail to Exchange Server 5.5, the following
critical stop event ID may be logged:

  Event Id: 238
  Source: MSExchangeMigDS
  Type: Error
  Category: None

  Description:

  The e-mail address specified for import object "User" is not unique.
  ccmail:User at PostOffice has already been assigned to Address Book entry
  /o=xxxx/ou=xxxx/cn=Recipients/cn=CCMAIL/cn=DB14168E.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The event ID 238 in the "Summary" section of this article is a misleading event
ID that may be related to the sequence of the add and delete transactions during
the migration.

Even though the event 238 is generated as a critical stop, the cc:Mail user is
actually correctly migrated; an Exchange Server mailbox is created for the user,
and the user's cc:Mail custom recipient is deleted from the Exchange Server
global address list.

In Exchange Server 5.5, the mailbox is added and the cc:Mail custom recipient is
deleted. This process is different than the migration process in Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.0, where the cc:Mail custom recipient is not deleted.
