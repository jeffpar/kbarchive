MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 50: Incorrect Instructions
-------------------------------

On page 50 change:
"Click the Query View button on the toolbar...."

To:
"Click the Query Run button on the toolbar...."


Page 507: Information In Note Is Incorrect
------------------------------------------

Due to changes in the product, the Note on page 507 is no longer correct. Please
disregard it. The following TIP information is correct:

"If you want to move one or more controls only horizontally or only vertically,
hold down the Shift key as you select the control (or the last control in a
group) that you want to move, and then drag either horizontally or vertically.
When Access detects movement either horizontally or vertically, it 'locks' the
movement and won't let the objects stray in the other axis. If you inadvertently
start to drag horizontally when you mean to move vertically (or vice versa),
click the Undo button and try again."


Page 538-541: qryXmplContracts Results In An Error In The Many-To-One Form
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

On pages 538-541, under the section titled Designing a Many-to-One Form, if you
use the qryXmplContracts sample query discussed on pages 537-538, the form will
contain fields that display an error, and your computer screen will not match
Figure 15-4 on page 540.

If you have a form based on a query, and the query contains multiple fields with
the same name (such as PostalCode from Table1 and PostalCode from Table2), the
control(s) on the form that are bound to that field name will be blank or may
display the "#Name?" error.

Because the same field name appears multiple times in the qryXmplContracts query,
Microsoft Access does not know which field to link to the control(s). Therefore,
instead of making an assumption about which field to bind to, it leaves the
control(s) linked to duplicate field names blank or displays the "#Name?" error
in the control.

To correct this behavior, rename the fields in the query so that there are no
duplicates.


Page 647: URL Is No Longer Valid
--------------------------------

The web address in the note on page 647 is no longer valid. Please change:
http://backoffice.microsoft.com/downtrial/optionpack.asp
(http://backoffice.microsoft.com/downtrial/optionpack.asp)

To:
http://www.microsoft.com/Windows/ie/pws/default.htm
(http://www.microsoft.com/Windows/ie/pws/default.htm)


Page 987: Paragraph Is Incorrect
--------------------------------

The first paragraph on page 987 should read as follows:

"You shouldn't normally need to change any of the options shown on the second
dialog box. If you want to be able to work directly with the sample BooksSQL
database, you must leave the options set as shown in Figure A-6. If you plan to
move your databases to a full version of SQL Server later, you should check with
your database administrator to verify that the options you choose match those on
the production server. If the options are different, you will have to import
your database to the new server rather than simply attach it.


ShortFN Folder Contains A Long Filename
---------------------------------------

The "ShortFN" folder contains a copy of all of the sample files included in the
"Running Access 2000 Samples" folder. The files in the ShortFN folder have 8.3
filenames so that users with older, 16bit CD-ROM drives or drivers can view all
files on the CD.

The folder \Documents, within the ShortFN folder, retains its long file name.
Note that any files located beneath this folder have shortened, 8.3 filenames.


Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
already contain most or all of the above corrections.
