SUMMARY
=======

Exchange Server Outlook Web Access (OWA) may use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
security for multiple reasons; the most common is to allow Windows NT domain
password changes from within OWA. However, by enabling SSL on the OWA Exchange
Server virtual directory, you also provide the most currently secure method for
accessing OWA.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To enable SSL on the Exchange Server virtual directory:

1. Register a Root Certificate Authority (CA) Certificate on the Internet
  Information Server (IIS) computer that OWA is installed on. For more
  information on setting up a CA Certificate, see the following article in the
  Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q218445 How to Configure Certificate Server for Use with SSL on IIS

2. Create and install a Key Certificate for the WWW portion of the IIS/OWA
  server. For more information on creating and installing the key certificate,
  see the above listed article, Q218445.

3. Start the Internet Service Manager (ISM), which loads the Internet
  Information Server snap-in for the Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

4. In the MMC, right-click the directory IISADMPWD, and then click Properties.

5. Click the Directory Security (or File Security) tab. Under Secure
  Communications, click the Edit button.

6. Click to select the "Require Secure Channel when accessing this resource""
  check box.

7. Click OK twice to return to the MMC.

  NOTE: These steps are enough to allow password changes from within OWA using
  SSL. Continuing with the remaining steps will enable SSL on the entire OWA
  site.

8. Repeat steps 4-7 for the Exchange Server virtual directory.

Any client's connection to any sites that have been SSL-enabled will require that
a copy of the Root Certificate Authority (CA) Certificate to be installed in the
client's browser. If you are using a commercial (VeriSign) Root CA Certificate,
this is usually already done. However, if you are using your own Root CA
Certificate (Microsoft Certificate Server), you will need to provide a link to
install this. See the above-listed article, Q218445, for additional information
on completing this.

SSL security on the Exchange Server virtual directory provides total encryption
of all data sent to and from the client browsers. The client authentication
methods provided by IIS (Allow Anonymous, Basic Clear Text, and NTLM) only
affect the logon process. Enabling SSL also encrypts the data sent, including
the logon process and the entire OWA session.

By enabling SSL on the Exchange Server virtual directory, you change the URL used
to access OWA to HTTPS://&lt;servername&gt;/Exchange and browsers display the
traditional padlock icon in the status bar.
