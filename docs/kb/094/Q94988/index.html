The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Some Gateway computers ship with the AnyKey programmable keyboard. On such
systems, the keyboard repeat rate may be extremely slow, or you may accidentally
program the keyboard to do something that you do not intend. In this situation,
symptoms may indicate you have a problem with either Microsoft MS-DOS or Windows
when this is not the case. To identify the AnyKey keyboard, locate a key labeled
"Program" in the upper-right corner of the keyboard.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following information may help you work around problems with the AnyKey
keyboard.

Slow Keyboard Repeat Rate
-------------------------

The AnyKey programmable keyboard allows you to select the rate at which keys
repeat when you hold down the keys. This setting overrides any setting made
using the DOS MODE command or Windows Control Panel. You may choose any one of
eight different rates, ranging from 2 characters per second (CPS) to 30
characters per second.

To set the repeat rate:

1. Press the Repeat Rate Key (found in the upper-right corner of the keyboard).
  The Program LED should begin to flash.

2. Function keys F1 through F8 produce the following repeat rates:

      F1    2  CPS
      F2    3  CPS
      F3    5  CPS
      F4    7  CPS
      F5   10  CPS
      F6   15  CPS
      F7   20  CPS
      F8   30  CPS

3. Press the function key that produces the rate you want, then press the Repeat
  Rate key again. The Program LED stops flashing and the new repeat rate is
  set.

Keyboard is Programmed Incorrectly
----------------------------------

To reset the keyboard to its default state:

1. Ensure the NUM LOCK, CAPS LOCK, and SCROLL LOCK LEDs are off. If these keys
  are remapped (that is, they do not respond), skip this step and continue with
  step 2.

2. Press the CTRL+ALT+Suspend Macro key combination. (The Suspend Macro key is
  in the upper-right corner of the keyboard.)

The Program light on the keyboard flashes momentarily, indicating that the
keyboard has been reset. If the keyboard hangs (stops responding) after
performing the above steps, unplug the keyboard from the central processing unit
(CPU), then plug it in again or restart the computer.

If the computer is running Windows, the reset may fail. If this happens, exit
completely out of Windows to the MS-DOS prompt, and repeat the reset
instructions.

The AnyKey keyboard is manufactured by Gateway, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
