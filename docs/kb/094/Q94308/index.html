The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message may appear when you attempt to share an otherwise
properly configured local CD-ROM drive while using Windows for Workgroups
(WFWG):

  You can only share resources that are on your computer. If you are trying to
  share a printer, make sure that it is a local printer and that the TEMP
  directory is on a local drive.

CAUSE
=====

This error may occur if the drive designator (letter) assigned to the CD-ROM
device was previously assigned to a remote resource on the network.

Windows for Workgroups running in enhanced mode provides the ability to share
local disks (including CD-ROMs) and printer resources with other users on the
network. If the local drive letter assigned to the CD-ROM has also been assigned
to a remote disk resource, by using the File Manager or a NET USE command, File
Manager still displays the CD-ROM and its contents for that drive letter.
However, attempts to share the CD-ROM results in the above error message.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are three workarounds to eliminate this problem, depending on the
configuration involved and the intended result. Use one of the following
methods:

- From the MS-DOS Prompt INSIDE of Windows for Workgroups, type:

  net use &lt;x&gt;: /d

  where &lt;x&gt; is the drive letter in conflict between the remote resource
  and the CD-ROM.

  -or-

- From the Windows for Workgroups directory MS-DOS command prompt OUTSIDE of
  Windows, delete the CONNECT.DAT file.

  NOTE: This removes ALL persistent network connections. You will need to
  manually re-establish all non-conflicting connections during your next
  Windows for Workgroups session.

  -or-

- Use the MSCDEX /L:&lt;letter&gt; option to change the drive letter assigned
  to the CD-ROM to that of an available, unassigned drive letter. MSCDEX is
  typically loaded with AUTOEXEC.BAT. Note that the /S parameter is also
  required to share the CD-ROM. Type "mscdex" (without the quotation marks) at
  the MS-DOS command prompt outside of Windows for Workgroups for a list of
  available MSCDEX options.
