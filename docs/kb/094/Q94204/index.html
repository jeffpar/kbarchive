SYMPTOMS
========

A single band of color may print as two bands of different colors on some color
dot-matrix printers. This problem is especially noticeable if you are printing
graphics. It does not usually affect black-and-white printing.

CAUSE
=====

The ribbon carriage on the printer may be out of alignment.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem is not caused by any software application. It is caused by a
mechanical problem with the printer and can usually be corrected by making a
simple adjustment.

For information on adjusting the color alignment of your printer, refer to your
printer manual or contact your printer manufacturer.

you can make color alignment adjustments:

  Brother
  Citizen
