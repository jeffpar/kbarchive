-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows-based application cannot be started from the MS-DOS command prompt
when starting Windows for Workgroups unless it is on the MS-DOS search path in
the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. The application cannot be started even if the current
directory is the directory in which the application resides. For example, typing
"WIN APP.EXE" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt does
not load Windows for Workgroups and then automatically run APP.EXE.

Entering a fully qualified path for the program may not correct the problem if
the program requires additional libraries to run. In this case, the only
workaround to this problem is to add the program's directory location to the
MS-DOS search path in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

This problem does not occur with Windows 3.1.

A notable exception to this problem is Microsoft Excel. It can be launched from
it's own subdirectory even when it is not on the MS-DOS search path.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
