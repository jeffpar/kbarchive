The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Remote for MS-DOS, versions 2.1, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft provides a replacement for the MAIL.EXE that is included with versions
2.1 and 3.0 of Microsoft Mail Remote for MS-DOS.

For complete information about obtaining and installing the MAIL.EXE file, see
the following sections:

- To download the updated file

- To update your MAIL.EXE file

MORE INFORMATION
================

This update contains MAIL.EXE, a replacement for the MAIL.EXE file that is
included with versions 2.1 and 3.0 of Microsoft Mail Remote for MS-DOS. This
update provides the following functionality:

- It adds the ability to save attachments sent from the Microsoft Mail
  Connection gateway and the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, Macintosh
  workstation.

- It corrects a problem with the X.400 gateway where the message body is forced
  into a T.61 attachment instead of an IA5 attachment. When the remote client
  sends mail to X.400 recipients that cannot accept T.61 attachments, the
  entire message is rejected.

- It correctly displays FFAPI network/postoffice entities defined on the remote
  user's home postoffice that have a Service Type = 100.

To download the updated file
----------------------------

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  DownloadDownload Rmtupd.exe now
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/pcmail/Update/18/WIN/EN-US/Rmtupd.exe)

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

After you download RMTUPD.EXE to a clean directory, run it (by typing "rmtupd"
(without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt) to extract the contents of
the file. You should receive the following files:

  MAIL.EXE (221,089 bytes, dated 02-15-93, 3:00 P.M.)
  README.TXT

To update your MAIL.EXE file
----------------------------

At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

  " copy &lt;drive:&gt;\mail.exe &lt;destination&gt; " (without the quotation
  marks)

where &lt;path&gt; is the drive and directory where you ran the self- extracting
RMTUPD.EXE file and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory where your
Mail Remote MAIL.EXE file currently resides. For example, if you ran the
self-extracting file from the TEST directory on drive D, and your MAIL.EXE file
is located in the MSREMOTE directory on drive C, type the following commands:

  copy d:\test\mail.exe c:\msremote
