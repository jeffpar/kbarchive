-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Outlook 98 Deployment Kit 
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When creating Outlook 98 foreign language deployment packages using the English
Outlook Deployment Kit, the package creation may fail with the following error
message:

  The Outlook 98 Deployment Wizard was unable to generate a customized version
  of Outlook. Either an error has occurred, or the user pressed Cancel

CAUSE
=====

When the Odklang.exe copies files from the CD, it is preserving the read-only
attribute of most of the files. When the ODK wizard tries to build a custom
package, it has problems with the read-only state of some of the files.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem.

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information on support costs, please go to the following address on the World
Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

+---------------------------------------------------+
| File Name   | Version    | Date   | Size          | 
+---------------------------------------------------+
| ODKLang.exe | 8.50.5620  | 9/3/98 | 66.560 bytes  | 
+---------------------------------------------------+
| Scrrun.dll  | 4.0.0.2926 | 9/3/98 | 402,481 bytes | 
+---------------------------------------------------+

After you obtain the fix, perform the following steps:

1. Copy ODKLang.exe to a computer that already has an ODK installation on it.

2. Copy Scrrun.dll to your system directory.

3. At a command prompt type, "regsvr32.exe scrrun.dll" (without the quotation
  marks).

4. Run ODKLang.exe.
