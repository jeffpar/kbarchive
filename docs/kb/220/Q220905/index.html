The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
- the operating system: Microsoft Windows CE, versions 3.0 Professional Edition, 3.0 
- Microsoft Windows CE 3.0 for the Handheld PC 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to retrieve mail from a Microsoft Exchange Server computer
version 5.5 mailbox by means of Internet Message Access Protocol 4 (IMAP4) using
the Inbox client included with the Windows CE Handheld PC Professional Edition,
Windows Pocket PC with Windows CE, or Windows CE for the Handheld PC 2000, you
may receive the following error message:

  ! You can send messages but not receive them. Unable to log on. Please check
  user name and password.

In addition, the following events may appear in the application event log:

  Event ID: 1300
  Type: Information
  Source: MSExchange IMAP4
  Description:
  An unauthenticated IMAP4 client IP_address issued the following command:
  01be5f80bfb95780 AUTHENTICATE NTLM.

  Event ID: 13004
  Type: Error
  Source: MSExchange IMAP4
  Description:
  Logon attempt from IP_address has failed: AcceptSecurityContext() call failed
  with error Access denied.

CAUSE
=====

You are attempting to access a mailbox that requires a clear-text password with
Windows NT Challenge/Response (NTLM) authentication enabled.

Or, you are using ANSI characters in your password.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, you have one of two options:

- Configure the Windows CE Inbox client's IMAP4 service wizard (on page 1 of 3)
  to use only clear-text passwords. To do this, you need to leave the Domain
  field in the Optional section blank, and populate the User ID field using the
  following syntax:

  &lt;Windows_NT_Domain&gt;/&lt;Windows_NT_account&gt;/&lt;Exchange_mailbox_alias&gt;

  For example: If the Windows NT domain is Domain1 Windows NT account is User1
  and the Exchange mailbox alias is U1, then the User ID field would be similar
  to the following:

  Domain1/User1/U1

  -or-

- Request your network or e-mail administrator to change the Exchange mailbox
  alias to match your Windows NT account.

Do not use ANSI characters in your password. An example of such an invalid
password occurs when you combine certain key strokes to use characters in the
ASCII extended character set, for example, when you hold down the ALT key while
you type 23456 on the numeric keypad of your keyboard.


MORE INFORMATION
================

When the optional Domain field on page 1 of the Windows CE Inbox IMAP4 service
wizard is populated, it forces the client to use Windows NT Challenge/Response
authentication. By leaving this field blank, the client uses a clear-text
password.

This article also applies to the Windows CE Inbox POP3 service wizard, although
the errors and event IDs may differ.
