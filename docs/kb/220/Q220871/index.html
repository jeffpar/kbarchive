The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11SP1, 2.11SP2, 3.0, 3.0SP1, 3.0SP2, 3.0SP3, 4.0, 4.0SP1, 4.0SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When an SNA Client application, such as a 3270 or 5250 emulator, attempts to
access a LU, and the LU is assigned to the built-in Authenticated Users group in
SNA Server Manager, an error message may be returned to the application
indicating that a problem has occurred. When using the 5250 or 3270 applet, the
following error message will be presented in a dialog box on the client
workstation:

  5250 Applet
  The Remote LU Name Specified For This Session Is Invalid.
  [0001] [000015B]

  3270 Applet
  ERROR - Your User Record Is Not Configured.
  Please Contact Your System Administrator

NOTE: Third-party emulators may not display the same error messages.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server is not properly handling resources assigned to the built-in
Authenticated Users group.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do not assign SNA resources to the built-in Authenticated Users group. Use other
Windows NT groups, such as Everyone, as an alternative.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server versions
2.11, 2.11SP1, 2.11SP2, 3.0, 3.0SP1, 3.0SP2, 3.0SP3, 4.0, 4.0SP1, 4.0SP2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To enable an SNA user to work with a specific 3270 LU, an administrator must
associate the LU with a corresponding user account or a group to which the user
belongs. In general, if LU resources are assigned to groups, all members of that
group can use the corresponding LUs to access host-based applications. Groups
can simplify the configuration of multiple users, whereas user accounts allow
SNA resources to be assigned more individually. APPC LUs can be defaulted to
users and groups as well.

A new built-in Windows NT group called Authenticated Users is created in the
Security Account Manager (SAM) database when installing Windows NT 4.0 Service
Pack 3 or later. You can select this group from the drop-down list when you
attempt to add a group to the Configured Users folder in SNA Server Manager.
Some SNA administrators may be tempted to use this new group when assigning or
defaulting LUs to respective SNA users.

NOTES: For additional information about Authenticated Users group, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q143474 Restricting Information Available to Anonymous Logon Users

For more information on how SNA Server prioritizes accounts when determining
default LUs, please see the online documentation.
