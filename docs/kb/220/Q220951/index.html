The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

If your Real Time Clock (RTC) or BIOS are not year-2000 compatible, logging on
to a computer running Windows NT in the year 2000 may result in the following
error message being displayed:

  Invalid System Time

  The time or date on your system time is invalid. Please use the date/time
  applet in the Control Panel to properly set your system time and date.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs during the log on process when Windows NT checks the date to
see if the date is possibly out of synchronization. If Windows NT 4.0 detects
the date is before 1996, then it assumes that there may be a problem with the
date and presents the above error message. Windows NT 3.51 uses the date of 1990
as the reference date.

For more information on how Windows NT interacts with the RTC and BIOS, please
reference the white paper Microsoft Operating System Interactions with BIOS and
Real Time Clock.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, contact your hardware manufacturer and get an update to
your System BIOS or RTC.

This is the best way to get your hardware ready for the year 2000. Some older or
specialized computers may not have an updated BIOS available and the above error
message could become tiresome or could hinder functionality.
If your system does not have an updated BIOS that addresses the year 2000
problem, you can use the Time Server Service from the Windows NT resource kit.
This utility allows one computer to be specified as a time server. The other
computers in the enterprise connect to the time server and update the Windows NT
clock. The Time Server service runs as a service so it loads whether a user logs
on or not. The computer designated as the time server needs to be year-2000
compliant because the computers that are not year-2000 compliant are
synchronizing with the time server.
The Time Server Service utility comes with the Windows NT resource kit and
instructions on how to use the service are included.
