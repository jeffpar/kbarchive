The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

As part of the troubleshooting steps for the Exchange OV/VM (PROFS) Connector,
it may be required to capture messages sent from the host to Exchange Server,
and subsequently reproduce the same problem locally. This article describes an
undocumented feature of the OV/VM Connector included with Microsoft Exchange
Server 5.5 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Install Exchange Server 5.5 and apply Service Pack 2.

2. Install and configure the OV/VM (PROFS) connector from Service Pack 2. Refer
  to the PROFS Connector documentation for further details if necessary.

3. Locate the Exchconn.ini file in the Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn folder.

4. Edit the Exchconn.ini file so that the following line is present in the
  [LME-PROFS] section. In the majority of cases, this parameter will already be
  present, but commented out.

  debug = Yes

5. Restart the OV/VM (PROFS) Connector for this to take effect. Note that this
  setting should only be used for troubleshooting purposes. It should be
  removed as soon as the problem is resolved, otherwise, every message sent
  from the host to Exchange Server is archived.

6. Create a secondary PROFS address for a mailbox recipient in Exchange Server
  that matches the intended recipient of that message, depending on the
  customer's environment and problem.

7. Start the Exchange Connectivity Administrator program.

8. Go to the Process Manager window.

9. Select, and then stop the following process:

  NJE Server or LME-PROFS-NJE

10. Open a command window and change directory to Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn.

11. Type in the following command to put your modified message back into the
  mail stream:

  "xfmload -nLME-PROFS-VMDIA -pCONTROL-SERVICE -i njeXXXX.dat" (without the
  quotation marks)

  where XXXX represents the sequential ordering of each archived file.

12. You see the following output:

C:\exchsrvr\CONNECT\exchconn&gt;xfmload -nlme-profs-vmdia -pcontrol-service -i nje0
000.dat
17:37:57- 3 00504:lme-profs-vmdia started
&gt; stdmain(883)
entering xfmlServEventTimer
exiting xfmlServEventTimer

exiting xfmlServEventTimer
max ru size specified in CT record is 1024
entering xfmlServEventTimer
nje0000.dat files not found...continuing
exiting xfmlServEventTimer
17:38:27- 2 00500:An ABNORMAL SHUTDOWN request has been received
&gt; stdmain(920)
17:38:27- 2 01108:Event server-lsnje.f-1.r has been destroyed, but is still registered with the event manager
&gt; evtsem(335)

C:\exchsrvr\CONNECT\exchconn&gt;

13. After the message has been reintroduced into Exchange Server, the NJE Server
  process needs to be manually restarted.
