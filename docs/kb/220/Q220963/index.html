IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain circumstances, all objects in the Multimedia tool in Control Panel
may not be displayed. This may cause problems if you need to configure an object
using the Multimedia tool.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the size of the following registry key becomes larger
than 512 bytes:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Drivers32

The Multimedia tool reads this key to obtain a display of objects. If the size of
this key is larger than 512 bytes, the Multimedia tool cannot read the entire
list of values (512 bytes are approximately 50 objects).

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods:

- Remove any unused audio or video codecs, sound card drivers, or video capture
  devices from the Multimedia tool. After the size of the registry key is less
  than 512 bytes, objects are properly displayed in the Multimedia tool.

- Change the order of objects in the registry so that the objects that you want
  displayed are configured to be at the top of the registry key:

  1. Click Start, click Run, and then type "regedit" (without the quotation
     marks).

  2. Find the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT \CurrentVersion\Drivers32

  3. Click the Drivers32 data value, click the Registry menu, and then click
     Export Registry File.

  4. Name the file Mm.reg, and then save it to the hard disk.

  5. Right-click the Mm.reg file, and then click Edit. This opens the file in
     Notepad so you can edit the registry keys.

  6. Cut and paste the entries that you want displayed in the Multimedia tool
     to the bottom of the file, leaving no blank lines.

  7. Save the changes to the file, and then quit Notepad.

  8. Double-click the Mm.reg file. A message appears, confirming that the
     registry is updated.

  9. Restart the computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The fact that an object is not displayed does not affect most programs; the
driver for a device still loads and is available.
