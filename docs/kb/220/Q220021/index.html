SYMPTOMS
========

In an AppWizard-generated MDI application with more than two view windows
overlapping each other, if the user clicks in the client area of the MDI frame
window other than the view, such that the view loses the focus, and then clicks
back in the client area of the view, the CHtmlView does not repaint correctly.
However, if the user clicks the nonclient area of the view, the CHtmlView
repaints correctly.

CAUSE
=====

The WS_CLIPCHILDREN style is not set for CHtmlView, and therefore, on activating
the view by clicking the view area, CHtmlView does not send a message to the
embedded Web Browser control to repaint itself.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, in PreCreateWindow of CHtmlView, add the
WS_CLIPCHILDREN style. Following is a code example:

  BOOL CSampleView::PreCreateWindow(CREATESTRUCT&amp; cs)
  {
  	// TODO: Modify the Window class or styles here by modifying
  	//  the CREATESTRUCT cs
  	cs.style |= WS_CLIPCHILDREN;

  	return CHtmlView::PreCreateWindow(cs);
  }

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++ .NET.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create an MDI application using the AppWizard.

2. In step 6/6 of AppWizard, choose View class as CHtmlView.

3. Build and run it.

4. On the File menu, click New, and launch a new ChildFrame so that you have
  more than two frames, one overlapping the other.

5. Click in the client area of the MDI frame window other than the CHtmlView,
  such that the view in consideration loses focus.

6. Try to set focus by clicking in the client area of CHtmlView in
  consideration.

RESULTS: Notice that the view has not completely repainted. Portions of the view
window, overlapped by the other view window, are not painted.
