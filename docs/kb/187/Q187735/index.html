-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a NetBIOS connection is established from a multihomed computer running
TCP/IP protocol to another computer, it might experience a delay in completing
the connection.

On versions of Windows NT earlier than Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3), a
multihomed computer will always try to establish a NetBIOS session using the
primary transport bound to the redirector before it tries other transports.

For additional information about this feature, please see the following article:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q166159
  TITLE : NetBIOS Connections from a Multihomed Computer

CAUSE
=====

When the redirector accepts the first transport that responds to complete the
call, it will issue cancel calls to the primary transport and all other
transports if applicable. It will then wait until all cancels are returned
before it continues with the session setup process on the accepted transport.
NetBT does not respond to a cancel call immediately until its session setup is
complete or times out (that is, going through all its name resolution methods).
This will cause a redirector delay in the session setup on the accepted
transport.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Technical Support to obtain the
following fix, or wait for the next Windows NT service pack.

This fix should have the following time stamp:

+---------------------------------------------------+
| 12/18/97 | 08:43p | 119,856 | Netbt.sys | (Intel) | 
+---------------------------------------------------+
| 12/18/97 | 08:40p | 220,048 | Netbt.sys | (Alpha) | 
+---------------------------------------------------+

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next service pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.


MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem and hotfix do not apply to Windows Sockets-based connections. When
a Windows Sockets application places a call from a multi-homed host the best
local source address is chosen automatically (using the route table), unless the
application specifies otherwise by choosing a local IP address to use in the
bind() call.

This behavior was changed in Windows NT Service Pack 3, where you can set a
registry parameter that causes the redirector to accept the first transport to
complete a call, rather than waiting for success or failure on the primary
transport.
