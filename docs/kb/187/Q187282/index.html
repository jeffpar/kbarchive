SUMMARY
=======

This article lists the Visual Basic run-time files installed by each version of
Visual Basic, Service Packs, and other updates. This information is helpful
because problems can result when you distribute mismatched versions of these
files with your Visual Basic application.

NOTE: The run-time files listed in this article are the core dependencies
required by all 32-bit Visual Basic applications. Your application may require
additional files based on the components you have included.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Following are the file names and version numbers listed by product. If a file is
not updated by a Service Pack or other update, three dashes (---) appear in
place of a version number:

Visual Basic 6.0 (Pre-release)
------------------------------

  MSVBVM50.DLL   6.00.7322

A pre-release version of Visual Studio 6.0 installed MSVBVM50.DLL version
6.00.7322. You cannot use or redistribute this file. If you have MSVBVM50.DLL
6.00.7322 on your computer, please delete and replace it.

After deleting MSVBVM50.DLL, you can reinstall it on Windows 95 and NT 4.0 (up to
Service Pack 3) by running MSVBVM50.EXE. (For more information, please see the
"References" section later in this article.)

If you have NT 4.0 Service Pack 4, you can reinstall MSVBVM50.DLL (after you
delete the pre-release version of the file) by reinstalling Service Pack 4.

There is a version of MSVBVM50.DLL version 05.00.4319 that is optimized
specifically for Windows 98. If you are running Windows 98, you can extract
MSVBVM50.DLL from the Win98_35.cab file on the Windows 98 CD. For additional

Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q129605 HOWTO: Extract Original Compressed Windows Files


Visual Basic/Visual Studio 6.0
------------------------------

  MSVBVM60.DLL    6.00.8176
  OLEAUT32.DLL    2.30.4261
  OLEPRO32.DLL    5.0.4261
  STDOLE2.TLB     2.30.4261
  ASYCFILT.DLL    2.30.4261
  COMCAT.DLL      4.71*

* On computers running Windows 9x, the Internet Explorer 4.01 Service
Pack 1 Setup installs COMCAT.DLL version 5.0. Internet Explorer 4.01 
Service Pack 1 is installed in the first segment of the Visual Studio 
6.0 setup program.

NT 4.0 Service Pack 4
---------------------

  MSVBVM50.DLL    05.02.8244 (SP2)
  MSVBVM60.DLL    6.00.8244
  OLEAUT32.DLL    2.30.4265
  OLEPRO32.DLL    5.0.4265
  STDOLE2.TLB     2.30.4265
  ASYCFILT.DLL    2.30.4265
  COMCAT.DLL      4.71

The version of Msvbvm50.dll that ships with Service Pack 4 for Windows NT 4.0 is essentially the same as the version that shipped with Visual Basic 5.0 Service Pack 2 and Service Pack 3. The only difference is a change that was made to avoid a problem due to the new heap allocator in Windows NT 4.0, Service Pack 4. The version number is higher so that it will not
be overwritten.

Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 1
--------------------------------

  MSVBVM60.DLL    6.00.8268
  OLEAUT32.DLL    2.30.4265
  OLEPRO32.DLL    5.0.4265
  STDOLE2.TLB     2.30.4265
  ASYCFILT.DLL    2.30.4265
  COMCAT.DLL      4.71*

* Service Pack 1 contains COMCAT.DLL version 4.71, but Windows 9x 
computers that already have Visual Studio 6.0 installed will have 
COMCAT.DLL version 5.0 because it is installed with Internet Explorer 
4.01 Service Pack 1 during the Visual Studio 6.0 Setup.

Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 2, Vbrun60.exe
---------------------------------------------

  MSVBVM60.DLL    6.00.8268
  OLEAUT32.DLL    2.40.4268
  OLEPRO32.DLL    5.0.4268
  STDOLE2.TLB     2.40.4268
  ASYCFILT.DLL    2.40.4268
  COMCAT.DLL      4.71*

* Service Pack 1 contains COMCAT.DLL version 4.71, but Windows 9x 
computers that already have Visual Studio 6.0 installed will have 
COMCAT.DLL version 5.0 because it is installed with Internet Explorer 
4.01 Service Pack 1 during the Visual Studio 6.0 Setup.
