-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When the message transfer agent (MTA) on one Microsoft Exchange Server computer
attempts to connect to the MTA on another Exchange Server computer, it proposes
a particular checkpoint size. When the second MTA accepts the connection, it may
propose a different checkpoint size. If the connection ends unexpectedly, the
first MTA attempts to connect again. However, the second MTA may not propose the
same checkpoint size that it originally proposed, even if the first MTA does.

Note that if the first MTA established a monologue connection, the inconsistency
between the original session protocol data unit (SPDU) and the recovery SPDU may
prevent the first MTA from reconnecting after the original connection ends.

STATUS
======
