-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to select, configure, and use a game controller in
Baseball 3D.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following topics explain how to set up game controllers in Baseball 3D and
how to use them when you play a game.

- Choosing Controllers

- User Settings

- Using Game Controllers

- Batting

- Running the Bases

- Pitching

- Fielding

Choosing Controllers
--------------------

You can play Baseball 3D with a game pad, a joystick, or a keyboard. For best
results, we recommend you use a game pad. To select a game controller in
Baseball 3D, follow these steps:

1. Start Baseball 3D, choose a game, and then select teams.

2. On any pre-game screen, click Controls.

3. Select a controller for each team. Baseball 3D displays the currently
  selected controller for a team in color, available controllers in light gray,
  and unavailable controllers in dark gray. To select a game controller, follow
  these steps:

  a. If you want to run a simulated game, click Reset to clear all controller
     selections.

  b. If you want to play a single-player game, click the controller you want to
     use for your team, and then verify that no game controller is selected for
     the other team.

  c. If you want to play a two-player game, click the controller you want to
     use for your team, and then click the controller your opponent wants to
     use for their team.

4. When you are ready to play, click Play Ball.

User Settings
-------------

In Baseball 3D, each player can configure their own user settings. To do so,
follow these steps:

1. On the Controls screen, click User Settings in the controller selection box
  for your team.

2. Under Batting, click either Basic or Advanced. If you click Advanced, you can
  aim your swing and move the batter in the box. Advanced batting gives you
  more control, but also makes it more challenging to hit the ball. If you
  click Basic, you only need to time your swing to hit the ball.

3. Baseball 3D can provide computer assistance for running or throwing and
  fielding, and display swing selection and pitch selection menus. To configure
  the computer assistance options, follow these steps:

  a. If you want computer assistance with base running, click the Running
     button to turn it on. If you want full control of base running, click the
     Running button to turn it off.

  b. If you want computer assistance with throwing and fielding, click the
     Throwing/Fielding button to turn it on. If you want full control of
     throwing and fielding, click the Throwing/Fielding button to turn it off.

  c. If you want to see swing and pitch selection menus, click Select
     Swing/Pitch Menus to turn it on. If you do not want to see swing and pitch
     selection menus, click Select Swing/Pitch Menus to turn it off.

4. Click OK.

Using Game Controllers
----------------------

To open the online Player's Guide to the "Controls" topic, click Using
Controllers on the User Settings screen. From there you can link to Help topics
that contain printable tables of commands for game pads, joysticks, and
keyboards. Controller information is also available in the booklet inside the
CD-ROM jewel case.

The tables below list the Baseball 3D commands for game pads, joysticks, and
keyboards.

Game Pad:

The direction control on the game pad is laid out like a baseball diamond, and so
are the game pad buttons.

For an illustration of the game pad button and direction assignments in Baseball
3D, please see the Using a Game Pad topic in the online Players' Guide.

  Second base   UP          2
  Third base    LEFT        3

Joystick:

The direction control on the joystick is laid out like a baseball diamond, and
the joystick buttons are sequentially assigned to the bases, starting with home
plate for button 1.

For an illustration of the joystick direction assignments in Baseball 3D, please
see the Using a Joystick topic in the online Players' Guide.

Keyboard:

There are three different keyboard layouts in Baseball 3D. Each set of keys is
configured like a baseball diamond, as are the ARROW keys. All three keyboard
layouts are active when you select the keyboard as your controller.

For an illustration of the keyboard key assignments in Baseball 3D, please see
the Using a Keyboard topic in the online Players' Guide.

1. If you want to use keyboard layout 2 or keyboard layout 3, substitute the
appropriate keys.

*NOTE: The longer you hold the energy boost button, the greater the effect. For
best results, release the button just before the pitcher releases the ball. If
you hold the button too long, you decrease the effectiveness of the energy
boost. The effect of the energy boost differs with the type of pitch. On a
fastball or split-fingered fastball, an energy boost increases the speed of the
ball. On a curve ball or screwball, an energy boost increases the spin of the
ball.

Fielding
--------

Before Fielding the Ball:

When the batter hits the ball, you can select the fielder closest to the ball,
increase fielder speed, and run, dive, or jump for the ball.

  NOTE: Throws from the outfield might be cut off before reaching the intended
  base. The catcher has one second to throw to a base after a pitch.

After you finish a play, the player that has the ball automatically returns it to
the pitcher. To manually return the ball to the pitcher, tap the game pad
button, joystick button, or key for the base where the ball is located.
