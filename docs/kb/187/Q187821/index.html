SUMMARY
=======

The following article describes the functionality of the Registration Web
component of Microsoft FrontPage.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The purpose of the Registration Web in FrontPage is to provide a limited means
of tracking the usage of the restricted Web. The Registration Web provides a
very limited form of security in that it requires a user to first register for
the Web before browsing the Web; however, the Registration Web allows you to
create a new account at any time, which defeats security for the restricted Web.
Even if an administrator removes a specific user from the restricted Web, that
user could simply use the registration form to add herself or himself to the
list of registered users. Moreover, there is no verification that the data that
is entered by users is correct. Even if the registration form requires the entry
of an e- mail address, the form handler does not verify that the e-mail address
is valid before adding the user to the list of registered users for the
restricted Web.

The Registration Web relies heavily upon the honesty of the users who are
registering for the Web. For example, if the restricted Web is a discussion
forum and user x is causing problems on the forum, the administrator for the Web
could remove user x from the list of registered users. However, user x could
return to the registration form and register as user y with a false e-mail
address. User y would be instantly granted access to the discussion forum.
