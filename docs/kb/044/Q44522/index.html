Question:

When using QuickC 2.00 and the regular-expression search parameters,
there seems to be an inconsistency in the way they are handled when
more than one regular expression is used in a search. For instance,
suppose I have the following string in my source file:

   "VUTTVVUU"

The string is found when I search using the following regular
expression:

   "[TUV]*"

If I search with the following regular expression, I would expect it
to find the data between quoted strings, but it matches each
individual character:

   [TUV]*

How is this inconsistency explained?

Response:

The regular expressions work as described in the QuickC 2.00 on-line
help. When more than one expression is used in a search, the results
are unpredictable. The example above is one such inconsistency that
occurs.

Only one regular expression should be used per search. Regular
expressions, within QuickC, were not meant to write complex search
strings. If such functionality is desired, it is better to use another
editor capable of such operations.
