Invoking C Version 5.10 SETUP with the /L command (to rebuild the
libraries) should create xSETARGV.OBJ (where x = S,M,C,L) for each
memory model chosen if a "C 4.00 compatible names for SETARGV.OBJ"
option is requested during setup. However, when the Setup program is
invoked with the /L command, it does not generate SETARGV.OBJ for any
memory model. Setup does not even copy that file to the destination
drive; only the setup for the whole compiler creates xSETARGV.OBJ for
different memory models.

C 4.00 has four model-specific object modules, xSETARGV.OBJ (where x =
S,M,C,L), which you can link into a program to get wild-card expansion
for program arguments. In C 5.10 there is only one object SETARGV.OBJ
needed for ALL memory models. However, if you have MAKE files which
rely on the C 4.00 convention, you may want to tell the Setup program
to make COPIES of this file with the appropriate model-specific name.
In fact, the modules of xSETARGV.OBJ are all identical and differ only
in their names. Renaming SETARGV.OBJ is all that is required.

Therefore, if you are using SETUP just to rebuild the libraries and
have chosen C 4.00 compatibility, you must find SETARGV.OBJ on the
disk labeled "Floating-Point Libraries" and you must copy/rename that
file to suit the memory model(s) you have built.
