For the best explanation of tiling with the PAINT statement, please
refer to one of the following manuals:

1. Pages 181 to 191 (Section 5.8.2, "Painting with Patterns: Tiling")
   of the "Microsoft QuickBASIC 4.5: Programming in BASIC" manual for
   Version 4.50

2. Pages 228 to 239 (Section 5.8.2, "Painting with Patterns: Tiling")
   of the "Microsoft QuickBASIC 4.0: Programming in BASIC: Selected
   Topics" manual for Versions 4.00 and 4.00b

3. Pages 228 to 239 (Section 5.8.2, "Painting with Patterns: Tiling")
   of "Microsoft BASIC Compiler 6.0: Programming in BASIC: Selected
   Topics" for Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS OS/2 and MS-DOS

4. Pages 179 to 189 ("Painting with Patterns: Tiling") of "Microsoft
   BASIC 7.0: Programmer's Guide" for Microsoft BASIC Professional
   Development System (PDS) Version 7.00 for MS OS/2 and MS-DOS

The tiling information on these pages also applies to QuickBASIC 2.00,
2.01, and 3.00 (which support only SCREENs 0, 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10).

Please also see a separate article in this Knowledge Base, which can be
found by querying on the following words:

   PAINT and tiling and QuickBASIC

Consider the following sentence taken from the PAINT statement in the
language reference manual:

   In the tile string, each byte masks eight bits along the x-axis
   when putting down points.

The effect of each bit on screen pixels depends upon how many
attributes are in that screen mode. On two-attribute screen modes
(SCREENs 2, 3, 4, 11), each bit in the tile string directly represents
a pixel, and each byte in the tile string represents 8 pixels along
the x-axis. In graphics screens with more than two attributes (1, 7,
8, 9, 10, 12, 13), each pixel is represented by more than 1 bit (in
order to carry the extra color information). In SCREEN 13, which has 8
bits per pixel, tiling is not very useful. Tiling is most flexible in
SCREENs 2, 3, 4, and 11.
