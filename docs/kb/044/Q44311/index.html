Screen images displayed in some painting and picture-viewing programs
can be imported to QuickBASIC. To do this, you must be able to exit
program that displays the picture, and leave the viewed picture on the
screen. Most programs that can terminate while leaving the screen
intact can be used, as described below.

This information applies to Microsoft QuickBASIC Versions 2.00, 2.01,
3.00, 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50; Microsoft GW-BASIC Interpreter Versions
3.20, 3.22, and 3.23; Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b
for MS-DOS and MS OS/2; and to Microsoft BASIC PDS Version 7.00 for
MS-DOS and MS OS/2.

1. The BASIC program must first activate the screen mode that the
   picture will be displayed in. This is done with a SCREEN statement.

2. The BASIC program should then SHELL out to the picture viewing
   program, which should display the picture and then exit, leaving
   the picture displayed (check the picture program's manual for the
   proper procedure to do this).

3. When the picture-viewing program has terminated, control is passed
   back to BASIC. The BASIC program can then use the BSAVE statement
   to save the screen image to disk.

Note: There are several graphics programs available on CompuServe and
GE GEnie (General Electric Network for Information Exchange) that are
suitable for this use.
