-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Word supports conversion of WordPerfect 5.x secondary merge files, but
not conversion of WordPerfect 6.x secondary merge files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A WordPerfect 6.x document can be opened in Word 97, provided the WordPerfect
6.x import converter has been installed. However, the format of an imported
secondary file is not valid as a Word 97 data document unless you edit it prior
to performing a mail merge.

Word 97 supports direct conversion of secondary files from WordPerfect 5.0 and
5.1 for MS-DOS and WordPerfect 5.1 and 5.2 for Windows. Word 97 can use the
imported secondary file in a mail merge. To use a WordPerfect 5.x secondary
file, simply open the file in Word 97, or access the file in a mail merge.

WordPerfect 5.x Secondary files and Word 97
-------------------------------------------

Word 97 automatically detects and converts WordPerfect 5.x secondary merge files
to Word data source document format, provided the appropriate text converter is
installed. To open the WordPerfect 5.x secondary file simply open the file in
Word 97, or access the file in a mail merge.

Secondary files containing 31 fields or fewer become tables, and those with more
than 31 fields become tab-delimited data documents. WordPerfect conditional
print merge constructs and macros are not retained. WordPerfect {END FIELD} and
{END RECORD} merge commands must be properly placed in a WordPerfect file or
field data may be placed in the wrong column or row after conversion to Word.

WordPerfect 6.x Secondary Files and Word 97
-------------------------------------------

Word 97 can open a WordPerfect 6.x secondary file if the WordPerfect 6.x import
converter has been installed. However, the file will be interpreted as a normal
WordPerfect document.

When converting the WordPerfect 6.x secondary file, the document text and layout
will be retained, but merge commands appearing within braces (for example,
{FIELD NAMES}, {END FIELD}, and {END RECORD}) are lost.

NOTE: You will need to obtain the WordPerfect 6.x for Windows import text
converter.

How to Import a WordPerfect Secondary File
------------------------------------------

Use the appropriate method below to import.

Method 1: Use If You Have Access to WordPerfect:

Create a new primary document in WordPerfect 5.x or 6.x such that when it is
merged with the secondary file, the resulting merged file is in a valid data
document format that Word can use in a print merge. Use the method appropriate
for your version of WordPerfect to accomplish this.

WordPerfect 5.x:
----------------

1. Open the secondary file in WordPerfect and determine whether the records are
  in the correct format. Each record should appear on a separate page and
  should have the same number of {END FIELD} codes. If any record contains
  fewer {END FIELD} codes than any other record, the record contains fewer data
  categories than the other records. This format causes an error if used in a
  Word merge unless an {END FIELD} code is inserted as a place holder for each
  missing data category of information in each record.

2. Create a new WordPerfect document.

3. Type one quotation mark ("), click Merge on the Tools menu and select Field.

4. In the Insert Merge Code Box, type a 1 (The 1 corresponds to the first field
  and so on) click OK. The result is the text "{Field}1~ in the document.

5. Type one quotation mark, which encloses the field in quotation marks, and
  type a comma in order to separate the field from the next field that will be
  inserted. Do not press the ENTER key between fields.

6. Repeat steps 3 through 5 for each field in the secondary file. You should
  also enclose the last field that is inserted in quotation marks; it should
  not be followed by a comma.

7. After inserting all the fields such that they are enclosed in quotation marks
  and separated by commas, press ENTER once and save the file with the name
  Newmain.wpd. An example of the file might look like (where &lt;HARD
  RETURN&gt; represents pressing ENTER once):

  "{Field}1~","{Field}2~","{Field}3~"&lt;HARD RETURN&gt;

8. To merge the previously created secondary file, click Merge on the Tools
  menu, select Merge, type the name of the new primary file, Newmain.wpd, in
  the Primary File box, type the name of the existing secondary file in the
  secondary File box, and click OK.

9. Save the file with a new name, and then open the file in Word.

10. If the first line of text in the merged file contains text other than actual
  data, select the entire first line of text and press ENTER once. (This
  deletes the existing first line of text, and moves the data to the first
  line in the file.)

11. Click Replace on the Edit menu, click the Clear button if it is available.
  Place the insertion point in the Find What box, type "^d" (without the
  quotation marks. Clear any text or spaces in the Replace With box. Click
  Replace All and close the Replace box.

12. Place the insertion point at the beginning of the document in front of the
  quotation mark before the first record and press ENTER once. Move the
  insertion point back up to the empty paragraph that was created by pressing
  the ENTER key and type the name of each field. Enclose each field name in
  quotation marks and separate it with commas. Be sure not to forget to type
  any of the names of the fields. There should be as many field names as there
  are {END FIELD} codes for a record in the WordPerfect secondary file. For
  example, the first line of text (called a header record followed by data)
  might look like:

  "firstname","lastname","address","city","state","zip"&lt;HARD RETURN&gt;
  "Jane","Doe","One Main Street","Seattle","WA","98101"&lt;HARD RETURN&gt;

  No spaces, punctuation, slashes, or dashes are allowed in the header record.
  No blank lines or text should appear before the header record.

13. Save the file.

You can use this document as a Word data document in a print merge.

WordPerfect 6.x:
----------------

NOTE: If the WordPerfect 6.x secondary file is in a table format rather than a
text format, you can open the file in Word 97 with the WordPerfect 6.x import
converter and you do not need to follow the steps below. You can use the data
file after removing the extra paragraphs in each of the table cells.

1. Create a new WordPerfect document.

2. On the Tools menu, click Merge, and then click Form.

3. In the Associate A Data File box, type the name of the previously created
  data document and click OK.

4. Type one quotation mark (").

5. Click Insert Field and select and insert a field in the list.

6. Type another quotation mark to enclose the field in quotation marks. Then
  type one comma (,).

7. Type another quotation mark, select another field and insert it.

8. Type another quotation mark and type a comma.

9. Repeat steps 7 and 8 for each field. You should also enclose the last field
  that you insert in quotation marks, but should not follow it with a comma.

10. After inserting all the field names such that they are enclosed in quotation
  marks and separated by commas, press ENTER once. For example, the file might
  look as follows (note that ENTER was pressed once only after the last field
  name was inserted):

  "FIELD(firstname)","FIELD(lastname)","FIELD(address)",
  "FIELD(city)","FIELD(state)","FIELD(zip)"&lt;HARD RETURN&gt;

  No spaces, punctuation, slashes, or dashes are allowed in the header record.
  No blank lines or text should appear before the header record.

11. Click Merge, and then click Merge in the dialog box.

12. Click Options, and click to clear the "Separate Each Merged Document with a
  Page Break" option. Click OK twice.

13. Place the insertion point before the quotation mark in front of the first
  word in the document and press ENTER.

14. Move the insertion point back to the first blank paragraph created in the
  previous step and type the name of each field where each field name is
  enclosed in quotation marks and separated by commas. Be sure not to forget
  to type any of the names of the inserted fields. For example, a one-record
  data file might look as follows:

  "firstname","lastname","address","city","state","zip"&lt;HARD RETURN&gt;
  "Jane","Doe","One Main Street","Seattle","WA","98101"&lt;HARD RETURN&gt;

15. Save the file.

You can use the resulting document as a Word 6.x or 7.0 data document in a print
merge. If you have an earlier version of Word, save the file in an intermediary
format, such as the version of Word being used, an earlier WordPerfect format,
or Rich Text Format. Method 2: Use If You Do Not Have Access to WordPerfect:

It is possible to clean up a WordPerfect 5.x or 6.x for Windows data document in
Word after converting the file directly from WordPerfect format. However, due to
the number of possible variations to the layout of a WordPerfect data document
and the complexity and variations that are required in a clean-up macro, this
method is recommended only if you do not have access to WordPerfect and cannot
use method 1.

A valid Word data file must be either a comma or tab delimited file, or must be
formatted as a table. If a delimited document is used, the delimiter must
separate each category of information (or data field) for each record. Each
record must have the same number of delimiters, and each record must be
separated from the next record by a hard return.

If a table is used, data field information must appear in a separate table cell,
and each row (which corresponds to a singe record) must have the same number of
cells. Both types of data files must contain a header record, which lists all
the field names that identify the data field categories. An example of a
two-record tab delimited data file, where the non printing characters have been
noted in brackets, follows:

  First {TAB} Last {TAB} Address {TAB} City {TAB} State {TAB}
  Zip {HARD RETURN}
  Sam {TAB} Elliot {TAB} 3499 Green Hills Rd. {TAB} Beverly Hills {TAB}
  CA {TAB} 98830 {HARD RETURN}
  Kate {TAB} Simmons {TAB} 1104 Calvary St. {TAB} Hampton {TAB} VA {TAB}
  11101 {HARD RETURN}

The following method uses the Replace command to arrange a converted WordPerfect
data file for use in Word.

1. Open the WordPerfect secondary merge file in Word.

2. View the document and determine whether the records are in the correct
  format. Each record should appear on a separate page and should have the same
  number of tabs. (Turn on non printing characters if you cannot see tabs,
  which look like gray arrows.) If a record contains a paragraph mark that is
  not at the end of the last field but is between data fields, delete the
  paragraph and press the TAB key once. If a record has fewer tabs than any
  other record, the record contains fewer data categories than the other
  records. You must determine which data category is missing in the record,
  place the cursor at that location, and insert a tab as a placeholder.

3. On the File menu, click Page Setup, and change the paper size to custom, 20"
  width and 20" length.

4. On the Edit menu, click Replace, and replace Page Breaks with two percent
  signs as follows. Click Replace All.

  In the Find What box, type: ^m

  In the Replace box, type: %%

5. On the Edit menu, click Replace, and replace paragraph markers with nothing
  as follows. Click Replace All.

  In the Find What box, type: ^p

  In the Replace box:

6. On the Edit menu, click Replace, and replace the two percent signs with a
  paragraph marker as follows. Click Replace All.

  In the Find What box, type: %%

  In the Replace box, type: ^p

7. Save the file with a new file name in order to preserve the original file.
  The file should now look like each line contains only one record. Each record
  should begin with the same field information.

8. Insert a header record as the very first record in the data file, where each
  field name is separated from the others by a tab.

  A header record inserted at the top of a data file might appear like this (non
  printing characters are not noted):

     name           address                city         state  zip
     Sam Elliott    3499 Green Hills Rd.   Beverly Hills   CA  98830
     Kate Simmons   1104 Calvary St.       Hampton         VA  11101

  No spaces, punctuation, slashes, or dashes are allowed in the header record.
  No blank lines or text should appear before the header record.

9. Once the header record is inserted, save the file.

You can now use this file for a data file in a Word Mail Merge.

WordPerfect Mail Merge Formats
------------------------------

WordPerfect's secondary mail merge files are significantly different from Word
for Windows, Word for the Macintosh, and Word for MS-DOS data documents. In
WordPerfect, a data document (by default) aligns merge data down the left margin
with each field on a separate line, and each record separated by an
end-of-record code. In all versions of Microsoft Word, each record contains
fields that are separated by delimiters, and each record is separated by a hard
return.

The sections below describe the default layouts used by WordPerfect 5.1 for
MS-DOS and WordPerfect 5.x and 6.x for Windows, as well as the somewhat
different format used by WordPerfect 5.0 for MS-DOS. Possible manual variations
of the default formats are also described.

WordPerfect 6.x Secondary Merge File Format
-------------------------------------------

By default, a WordPerfect secondary text file created in WordPerfect 6.0 or 6.1
for Windows separates records by using the ENDRECORD merge command followed by a
hard page break. The information in each record is divided into fields. Fields
within each record are separated by the ENDFIELD merge command followed by a
hard carriage return.

Fields may be referenced in a primary merge document by number or by name. Fields
are automatically numbered by WordPerfect from top to bottom by default. If
names are assigned to fields, these names will appear in a record at the
beginning of the secondary merge file preceded by the FIELDNAMES merge command.

Therefore, by default, a WordPerfect 6.x secondary merge file that includes field
names appears similar to the following:

  FIELDNAMES(Name;Address)ENDRECORD
  (Hard Page Break)
  Mary Jane DoeENDFIELD
  Seattle, WashingtonENDFIELD
  END RECORD
  (hard page break)

WordPerfect 5.x Secondary Merge File Format
-------------------------------------------

By default, a WordPerfect secondary file created in WordPerfect 5.1 for MS-DOS or
WordPerfect 5.1, 5.2 for Windows separates records by using the {END RECORD}
merge command followed by a hard page break. The information in each record is
divided into fields. Fields within each record are separated by the {END FIELD}
merge command followed by a hard carriage return.

Fields may be referenced in a primary merge document by number or by name. Fields
are automatically numbered by WordPerfect from top to bottom by default. If
names are assigned to fields, these names appear in a record at the beginning of
the secondary merge file preceded by the {FIELD NAMES} merge command.

Therefore, by default, a WordPerfect 5.1 or 5.2 secondary merge file that
includes field names appears similar to the following:

  {FIELD NAMES}Name~Address~~{END RECORD}
  (Hard Page Break)
  Mary Jane Doe{END FIELD}
  Seattle, Washington{END FIELD}
  {END RECORD}
  (hard page break)

You might choose to manually manipulate the layout of a secondary merge document
in WordPerfect. The following are some of the possible manual variations of the
default layout:

- You could insert hard returns following each field name at the beginning of a
  secondary merge document so that the field names appear aligned down the left
  column in the same manner as the actual field entries appear by default. In
  such a case, the example above would instead appear as:

     {FIELD NAMES}
     Name~
     Address~
     ~{END RECORD}
     {Hard Page Break}
     Mary Jane Doe{END FIELD}
     Seattle, Washington{END FIELD}
     {END RECORD}

- You could remove the hard returns that normally follow each {END FIELD} code
  so that each data record appears horizontally across the page in the same
  manner as the field names do by default. In such a case, the example above
  would instead appear as:

     {FIELD NAMES}Name~Address~~{END RECORD}
     (Hard Page Break)
     Mary Jane Doe{END FIELD}Seattle, Washington{END FIELD}{END RECORD}

- You could reverse the layout of both field names and field entries. In such a
  case, the example above would instead appear as:

     {FIELD NAMES}
     Name~
     Address~
     ~{END RECORD}
     (Hard Page Break)
     Mary Jane Doe{END FIELD}Seattle, Washington{END FIELD}{END RECORD}

- You could not include any field name definitions in the secondary merge
  document, and instead simply make reference to each field in the primary
  document based on its field number. Depending on the horizontal or vertical
  (default) layout chosen for field entries, they are numbered in a record
  either from top to bottom or from left to right. In the example above, Name
  is field 1 and Address is field 2, and the secondary merge file would appear
  by default as:

     Mary Jane Doe{END FIELD}
     Seattle, Washington{END FIELD}
     {END RECORD}
     (hard page break)

WordPerfect 5.0 Secondary Merge File Format
-------------------------------------------

By default, a WordPerfect secondary file created in WordPerfect 5.0 for MS-DOS
separates records by using the Merge E command (^E followed by a hard page
break). The information in each record is divided into fields. Fields within
each record are separated by the Merge R command (^R followed by a hard
return).

Fields can be referenced in a primary merge document by number or by name.
WordPerfect automatically numbers fields from top to bottom by default. If names
are assigned to fields, these names appear in a record at the beginning of the
secondary merge file, preceded by the Merge N command (^N followed by a hard
return).

Therefore, by default, a WordPerfect 5.0 secondary merge file that includes field
names appears similar to the following:

  ^N
  Name^R
  Address^R
  ^E
  Mary Jane Doe^R
  Seattle, Washington^R
  ^E

This layout, with the exception of the differing merge commands, is the same as
that used by the more recent WordPerfect versions 5.1 and 5.2. The same possible
variations of this layout as outlined for those versions above are applicable to
WordPerfect 5.0.
