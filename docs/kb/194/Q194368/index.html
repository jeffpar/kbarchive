Last Modified: 04-MAR-2002

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0, the following code calls the default property of
obj:

  Dim obj As Object
  If obj = 5 Then

If the Object's default property returns an object, it recursively calls the
default property of that object until it finally finds a non-object property.

Prior to Visual Basic 6.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3), Visual Basic 6.0 only invoked the
default property of the second level, at most. If the default property is also
an object, Visual Basic 6.0 generates the following error message:

  Type Mismatch

CAUSE
=====

The way the comparison operators (=, &gt;, &lt;, etc.) evaluate objects was
changed in Visual Basic 6.0. However, the behavior was changed back in Visual
Basic 6.0 SP3.

NOTE: Visual Basic 5.0 behavior for this case is undocumented and programmers
should not rely on this feature.

RESOLUTION
==========

- Install Visual Basic 6.0 SP3 or later.

  -or-

- Use the following workaround:

  1. Add the following function to your project:

        Public Function EvaluateObjToLong(obj As Object) As Long
              EvaluateObjToLong = obj
           End Function

  2. Replace the following line:

        if obj = 5 then

  with:

        if EvaluateObjToLong(obj) = 5 then

NOTE: This is only a workaround for migrating from Visual Basic 5.0 to Visual
Basic 6.0. Programmers should not rely on this feature. The recursive evaluation
of the default property of the assignment operator may change in future
versions.

The use of default properties, especially non-parameterized default properties,
is discouraged for the following reasons:

- The code is harder to read because the person who reads your code must know
  exactly which property is the default to understand what you are really
  doing.

- The code might not work the way you think it should and the behavior might
  change between different versions of Visual Basic.

- If you forget to write the property name when you use an object that has a
  default property, Visual Basic considers that you are using the default
  property and you will not get an error message when you compile the code.
  However, if your object does not support a non-parameterized default
  property, the compiler generates an error message.

STATUS
======

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3.

For more information about Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs, please see the
following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q194022 INFO: Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs, What, Where, Why

  Q194295 HOWTO: Tell That Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs Are Installed

NOTE: This behavior change is by design. The reasons for this are:

- This change makes the behavior of late bound objects more closely match that
  of early bound objects.

- The behavior of Visual Basic 5.0 permits the possibility of an infinite loop,
  which was determined to be much worse than this restriction.

================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new ActiveX DLL project in Visual Basic 5. Class1 is created by
  default.

2. From the Project menu, add two additional classes named Class2 and Class3 to
  the project.

3. Add following code to Class1:

        Public Property Get DefProp() As Object
           Set DefProp = New Class2
        End Property

4. From the Tools menu, select Procedure Attributes. In the Procedure Attributes
  dialog box, click the Advanced &gt;&gt; command button, and then change the
  Procedure ID to "&lt;Default&gt;."

5. Add the following code to Class2:

        Public Property Get DefProp() As Object
           Set DefProp = New Class3
        End Property

6. Set the DefProp of Class2 to be the default property, as in step 4.

7. Add the following code to Class3:

        Public Property Get DefProp() As Long
           DefProp = 5
        End Property

8. Set the DefProp of Class3 to be the default property, as in step 4.

9. From the File menu, add a Standard EXE project to the project group as
  Project2. Form1 is created by default. Set Project2 as the start up project.

10. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Form1:

        Public Function EvaluateObjToLong(obj As Object) As Long
              EvaluateObjToLong = obj
           End Function

           Private Sub Form_Load()
              Dim obj As Object
              Set obj = CreateObject("project1.Class1")
              If obj = 5 Then MsgBox "work"
           End Sub

11. Press the F5 key to run the project, and note that a message box displays
  the word "work."

12. Stop the project and save the project group.

13. Open the project group in Visual Basic 6.0 (without Service Pack 3) and run
  the project. The following error message displays:

  Run Time Error '13':
  Type Mismatch

14. Change the line:

        If obj = 5 Then MsgBox "work"

to:

         If EvaluateObjToLong(obj) = 5 Then MsgBox "work"

15. Run the project again, and note that the Message box displays "work."
