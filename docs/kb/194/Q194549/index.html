-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to send a message to a single X.400 recipient, and the
Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 is unable to deliver the message, you may
receive a non-delivery report (NDR) that is not associated with the original
message, and the following entry may appear in the System.log file:

  [024] Message was not delivered: routing file was corrupted.

CAUSE
=====

When the Microsoft Mail Gateway to X.400 is unable to deliver a message, the
gateway creates a non-delivery report (NDR) and an associated P1 file. If the
message was sent to a single recipient, the NDR and P1 file are created with no
recipients. Even though the NDR does not contain any valid recipients, the
gateway may attempt to send the NDR. When the External program attempts to
deliver the NDR, an additional NDR is generated, and the above entry is added to
the System.log file.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems
