-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Host Print Server introduced with SNA Server 3.0 is unable to successfully
print data from System/36 (S/36) or Advanced System/36 (AS/36) systems. If an
Advanced Program-to-Program Communications (APPC) print session is defined for
use with an S/36 or AS/36 system, the APPC print session will usually stay in an
Inactive or Pending state in SNA Server Manager when it attempts to activate.

CAUSE
=====

The Host Print Server was not originally designed to differentiate between
AS/400 and S/36 (or AS/36) printing. Therefore, it does not send the correct
Program Initialization Parameter (PIP) data to S/36 or AS/36 systems to allow
for successful initialization of a print device on these systems.

SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 2 added an update that allowed the System Type for
APPC print sessions to be specified as either AS/400 or System/36. This option
was exposed under the APPC tab for an APPC print session in SNA Server Manager.
When this option is set to System/36, S/36- and AS/36- specific PIP data is set
to the remote system.

In addition to this change, additional testing revealed that additional
modifications were needed to allow for additional S/36- and AS/36-specific PIP
data, and to allow the print sessions to be properly de-allocated and closed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
4.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 4.0.
This problem was first corrected in SNA Server version 4.0 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After applying the update, the APPC print session needs to be configured with
the System Type set to System/36 in SNA Server Manager under the APPC tab of the
Print Session Properties dialog box. This causes the Host Print Server to send
the correct PIP data to the S/36 or AS/36 system to initiate the print session.
In addition, the AS/400 Device Name parameter under the APPC tab of the Print
Session Properties dialog box must be set to a two- digit value that specifies
the Target-ID of the S/36 or AS/36 system.
