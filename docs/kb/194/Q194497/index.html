SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word, when you open a document that is in WordPerfect 5.x or 6.x
format, you may see PRIVATE fields at the beginning of and throughout the
converted document.

CAUSE
=====

This is a design feature of Word and the WordPerfect converter. A PRIVATE field
stores data for documents converted from other file formats. The field contains
data that allows Word to retain formatting information not used by Word but that
is necessary for optimally converting the file back to its original format. At
this time, PRIVATE fields are used only when converting documents from
WordPerfect 5.x and 6.x format to Word.

PRIVATE fields do not affect document layout in Word. If you do not want PRIVATE
fields to be displayed in your document, click the Show/Hide button on the
Formatting toolbar. Sometimes there is no way to turn off the PRIVATE field,
regardless of whether Show/Hide or Field Codes are turned off. However, it will
not appear in print preview or when the document is actually printed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The PRIVATE field that appears at or near the beginning of converted WordPerfect
documents notifies Word that the document was originally opened from
WordPerfect. This enables Word to make necessary adjustments to process other
PRIVATE fields for table of contents formatting codes and several other formats
if you later choose to save the document in WordPerfect format.

Sometimes, whether Field Codes are on or off under the View or Print tabs (on the
Tools menu, click Options), the {PRIVATE} fields are shown in normal and print
preview views and print {PRIVATE} on the document. When this behavior occurs,
Bookmark Not Defined is also shown in page layout view. To work around this
behavior, find these codes and cut them from the document.

You can search for these fields by using Replace or Find on the Edit menu. Type
"^dPRIVATE" (without the quotation marks). You can also manually search through
the document for the {PRIVATE} fields, select them, and then click Cut on the
Edit menu.
