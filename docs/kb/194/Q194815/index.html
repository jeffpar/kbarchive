SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to start your aircraft engines in Combat Flight
Simulator.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To start your aircraft engines in Combat Flight Simulator, use one of the
following methods:

Automatically Starting the Engine (Pointing Device)
---------------------------------------------------

To use your pointing device to automatically start the engine, click the Starter
switch and hold down the left mouse button.

The Prop Control, Mixture Control, Throttle, Magnetos, and Starter switches
automatically move to their proper positions, the engine is started, and then
the Starter switch automatically moves to the Off position.

Automatically Starting the Engine (Keyboard)
--------------------------------------------

To use the keyboard to automatically start the engine, press and hold down the E
key. The Prop Control, Mixture Control, Throttle, Magnetos, and Starter switches
automatically move to their proper positions, the engine is started, and then
the Starter switch automatically moves to the Off position.

Manually Starting the Engines
-----------------------------

To manually start the engines, follow these steps:

1. Press SHIFT+2 to open the engine controls window.

2. Set the Prop Control to the Max. R.P.M. position. To use your pointing device
  to do this, drag the Prop Control lever all the way forward. To use the
  keyboard to do this, press CTRL+F4.

3. Set the Mixture Control to the Full Rich position. To use your pointing
  device to do this, drag the Mixture Control lever all the way forward. To use
  the keyboard to do this, press CTRL+SHIFT+F4.

  NOTE: The Messerschmitt 109E and 109G only have throttle and prop control
  levers. The mixture is controlled automatically.

4. Set the Throttle Control to a position just above Minimum. To use the
  pointing device to do this, drag the Throttle Control lever all the way back
  (the Idle position), and then move it forward a small amount.

  To use the keyboard to do this, press the F3 key repeatedly until the Throttle
  Control lever moves all the way back (the Idle position), and then press the
  F4 key once to move the Throttle Control lever forward a small amount.

  To use the joystick to do this, turn the throttle control on your joystick all
  the way down, and then turn it up a small amount.

  NOTE: The Focke-Wulf 190 has a single lever that controls throttle, propeller,
  and mixture at the same time. Move this lever all the way back.

5. Activate the magnetos. The following table lists the appropriate methods for
  doing this for the different nationalities of aircraft.

     Aircraft
     Nationality            Method
     -----------------------------------------------------------------

     United Kingdom (RAF)   Click the Magneto switches to move them
                            both to the On position.

     Germany (Luftwaffe)*   Click the Magneto switch to move it to the
                            M1+M2 position.

     USA (USAAF)            Click the Magneto switch to move it to the
                            Both position.

  * The Focke-Wulf 190 does not have a Magneto switch.

6. Click the Starter switch and then hold the left mouse button down until the
  engine starts.

NOTE: You cannot use the Starter switch to turn off the engine.
