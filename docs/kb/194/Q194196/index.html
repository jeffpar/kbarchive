Last Modified: 22-OCT-2000

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

No help appears when you press the F1 key or when you select Microsoft Visual
FoxPro Help Topics from the Help menu. This occurs with distributed applications
installed on a system that does not have Visual FoxPro installed.

CAUSE
=====

The Setup Wizard does not copy either the Foxhhelp.exe or the Foxhhelpps.dll
file when you select the HTML HELP ENGINE in step 2 of the Setup Wizard.

RESOLUTION
==========

Copy the Foxhhelp.exe file and the Foxhhelpps.dll file from the Visual FoxPro
directory to the distribution directory from which you run the Setup Wizard.
During setup, select ActiveX in step 6 for the Foxhhelpps.dll file. Also, in
step 6, set the target directory to Winsysdir for the Foxhhelp.exe file and the
Foxhhelpps.dll file.

When you install a distributed application on a system that does not have Visual
FoxPro, you must manually register the Foxhhelp.exe file. You can do this by
running the Foxhhelp.exe file with the /REGSERVER option, for example:

  FOXHHELP /REGSERVER

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug has been fixed in the updated version of the Setup Wizard Vfp6swiz.exe
dated 10/08/1998. This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3.
For more information about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following
articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a program and add the following code:

  **** Code starts here
        SET HELP ON
        SET HELP TO mbshelp.chm

        ?SET("HELP")
        ?SET("HELP",1)
        ?SET("HELP",2)
        ?ON("key","f1")

        ON KEY LABEL F6 CLEAR EVENTS
        ON KEY LABEL F7 DO ShowIt
        READ EVENTS

        PROCEDURE ShowIt
        ?SET("HELP")
        ?SET("HELP",1)
        ?SET("HELP",2)
        ?ON("key","f1")
        RETURN
        **** Code ends here

2. Compile the program into an exe.

3. Create a Mbshelp.chm file or copy a .chm file from the Microsoft Developer
  Network directories and rename it to Mbshelp.chm.

4. Run the Setup Wizard and select HTML Help Engine in step 2.

5. Run the setup you created in step 4 and install the .exe file on a computer
  that does not have Visual FoxPro installed.

6. Run the .exe file.

7. Press the F1 key.

8. From the Help menu, choose Microsoft Visual FoxPro Help Topics.

9. Press the F7 key to display the current SET HELP settings.

10. Press the F6 key to exit the program.

The cursor disappears until the mouse moves and no help appears. The drop- down
menu disappears, but no help appears. The screen shows whether Help is on and to
where the help is set.
