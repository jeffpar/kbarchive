SUMMARY
=======

This articles discusses how to automatically install (register) a converter in
Word 97.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To automatically install (register) a converter in Word 97, follow these steps:

1. Copy the converter file that you want to install to either the Word program
  folder or the \Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Textconv folder.

2. Start Word.

3. On the File menu, click Open.

4. Select a file that Word cannot recognize (for example, a plain text file or a
  document in the format supported by the converter that you installed).

Word will detect and automatically register the converter in the following
location in the Windows 95 Registration Database:

  HKEY_USERS\.Default\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word\Text Converters

It is not necessary to complete steps 1 and 2 during the first file open in a
Word session. Also the "Confirm conversion at Open" option (located on the
General tab of the Options command on the Tools menu) does not have to be
checked during this process.


One of the following occurs when you open a foreign file in Word 97:

1. If the "Confirm Conversions at Open" option (located on the General tab of
  the Options command on the Tools menu) is not checked, Word will immediately
  open your document using the matching supported and installed converter.

2. If the file is a text file, Word will immediately open the file as Text Only.

3. If the file is of some other format not recognized by Word, and the "Confirm
  Conversion at Open" option is not check, the Convert File From dialog box
  will appear anyway, proposing to open the document as Text Only. Click Cancel
  and only open documents supported by the available converters.

  NOTE: If the FileOpen command has been modified in some way, the Convert File
  From dialog box may be bypassed. The macro intercepts the Convert File From
  dialog box and defaults to opening the file as Text Only, resulting in
  garbage characters. To display the Convert File From dialog box, select
  Confirm Conversions before opening the file.


4. If the Confirm Conversions option is checked, Word will prompt to open the
  document from the format supported by one of the installed converters or will
  prompt to open the file as Text Only if the file is plain text or another
  format not recognized by any of the installed converters or internally by
  Winword.exe.

  NOTE: All converters that are made available for use with Word 97, with the
  exception of the AmiPro and Enable converters, are shipped with Word 97 and
  Microsoft Office 97. You should use Setup to add and remove converters that
  are supplied with the product.
