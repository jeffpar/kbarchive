SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start one of the programs listed at the beginning of this
article, you may receive one of the following error messages

  Could not open "&lt;drive&gt;:\books\DSWMEDIA\homescr\stylegd.dcr" because it
  is already open with write permission by another user.

  Could not open "&lt;drive&gt;:\encyc99\DSWMEDIA\hscreen\hsint.dcr" because it
  is already open with write permission by another user.

  Could not open "&lt;drive&gt;:\encyc99\mm\titleseq.dc" because it is already
  open with write permission by another user.

where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive that contains the
program CD-ROM.

If you click OK, the program starts, but the background is white, and the menus

  encyclopedia will not work. Click Help to lean how to correct the problem.
  Click OK to continue without fixing the problem. Click Cancel to exit the

  problem persists, contact the program vendor.

If you click Details, you receive the following error message
