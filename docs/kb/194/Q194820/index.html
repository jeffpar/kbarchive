-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 on an Exchange Server
5.0 computer on which the Internet Mail Service is installed and Microsoft
Internet Explorer 4.01 Service Pack 1 (SP1) with Outlook Express has been
applied, the following error message may be displayed, and the installation
process may not complete successfully:

  Self registration of the DLL c:\winnt\system32\inetcomm.dll failed.

CAUSE
=====

When you install Exchange Server 5.5 on an Exchange Server 5.0 computer on which
the Internet Mail Service is installed, the Setup program attempts to register
the Inetcomm.dll file. During this registration process, the Inetcomm.dll file
attempts to load the Msoert.dll file.

When you apply Internet Explorer 4.01 SP1 with Outlook Express, new versions of
the Inetcomm.dll and Msoert.dll files are copied to your hard disk. When the
Exchange Server 5.5 Setup program attempts to register the Inetcomm.dll file, it
uses the new version of the Inetcomm.dll file on your hard disk. However, when
the Inetcomm.dll file attempts to load the Msoert.dll file, it uses the older
version of the Msoert.dll file on the Exchange Server 5.5 CD-ROM. This file
mismatch prevents the Inetcomm.dll file from being registered.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, replace the Inetcomm.dll and Msoert.dll files that
were copied to your hard disk when you applied Internet Explorer 4.01 SP1 with
the versions of the files on the Exchange Server 5.5 CD-ROM. Then, install
Exchange Server 5.5. After Exchange Server 5.5 has been installed, replace the
Inetcomm.dll and Msoert.dll files from the Exchange Server 5.5 CD-ROM with the
versions of the files that were copied to your hard disk when you applied
Internet Explorer 4.01 SP1.

To do so, follow these steps:

1. Rename the Inetcomm.dll and Msoert.dll files in the Winnt\System32 folder on
  your hard disk to Inetcomm.new and Msoert.new.

2. Copy the Inetcomm.dll and Msoert.dll files from the Exchange Server 5.5
  CD-ROM to the Winnt\System32 folder on your hard disk.

3. Install Exchange Server 5.5.

4. Rename the Inetcomm.dll and Msoert.dll files in the Winnt\System32 folder on
  your hard disk to Inetcomm.old and Msoert.old.

5. Rename the Inetcomm.new and Msoert.new files in the Winnt\System32 folder on
  your hard disk to Inetcomm.dll and Msoert.dll.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
