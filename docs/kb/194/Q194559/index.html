-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Systems Management Server SNMP Event Log Extension Agent (SNMPELEA) is
installed on a system that also has Compaq Insight Manager Agents installed, the
Windows NT SNMP service may fail to start at system startup. The Windows NT
Service Control Manager will report that the Windows NT SNMP service failed to
start. However, the Windows NT SNMP service will automatically start within a
few seconds.

RESOLUTION
==========


A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. If you are not severely affected by this
specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Systems
Management Server service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information on support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date       Time        Size      File name    Platform
  ------------------------------------------------------
  10/13/98   5:41pm      112,544   Snmpelea.dll (Intel)
  10/13/98   5:43pm      205,072   Snmpelea.dll (Alpha)


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, perform the following steps on the Systems Management
Server site server:

1. Replace the Snmpelea.dll file in the
  &lt;SMS_root_directory&gt;\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\&lt;platform&gt;.bin
  directory with the hotfixed version.

  NOTE: You can perform this step automatically by using Hotfix.exe with the
  provided Hotfix.ini file.

2. Maintenance Manager will replicate the updated files to the
  Logon.srv\&lt;platform&gt;.bin directory on the Systems Management Server
  logon servers during its next work cycle. After that occurs, you can update
  the clients. To update the clients, either manually run Upgrade.bat on each
  client or follow the instructions in the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:
