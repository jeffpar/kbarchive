CAUSE
=====

There may be more than one reason for this problem. One possible reason is that
the server's IP address or addresses listed in the registry contains leading
zeros in one or more octets. For example:

  015.057.120.001

When the DHCP Server service starts, it fails to come up on any of these
computer.

Adding leading zeros to the IP address from TCP/IP GUI Setup will not write to
registry. However, it is possible to enter leading zeros in IP addresses in an
Unattend.txt file; these leading zeros can be written to registry.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not use leading zeros for any of the IP addresses listed in an Unattend.txt
file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Server version 4.0.
