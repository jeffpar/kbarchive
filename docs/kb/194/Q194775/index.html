The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator: WWII Europe Series, version 1.0 
- Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator 2: WWII Pacific Theater, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you join or host a multiplayer game in Combat Flight Simulator or Combat
Flight Simulator 2, certain events or commands can put you in a suspended state.
When you are in a suspended state, your airplane does not seem to move on your
screen, but other players see you flying in a straight line on their screens.

If another player fires on you when you are in a suspended state, your airplane
is not damaged. Also, other players may notice that you can fly through solid
terrain features when you are in a suspended state.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you play a multiplayer game, Combat Flight Simulator sends suspended state
information to each player in the game. To monitor this information and catch
potential cheaters, you must modify the Combatfs.cfg file in Combat Flight
Simulator or the Cfs2.cfg file in Combat Flight Simulator 2. To do this, follow
these steps:

1. Quit Combat Flight Simulator or Combat Flight Simulator 2 if it is running.

2. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

3. In the Named box, type the following line appropriate for your version of
  Combat Flight Simulator:

  Combat Flight Simulator: WWII Europe Series

  "combatfs.cfg" (without the quotation marks)

  Combat Flight Simulator 2: WWII Pacific Theater

  "cfs2.cfg" (without the quotation marks)

4. In the Look In box, click My Computer, and then click Find Now.

5. Double-click the Combatfs.cfg or the Cfs2.cfg file.

6. In the "Choose the program you want to use" box, click Notepad.

7. Click to clear the "Always use this program to open this file" check box, and
  then click OK.

8. On the Search menu, click Find.

9. Type "[MULTIPLAYER]" (without the quotation marks) and then click Find Next.

10. When you locate the [MULTIPLAYER] section, click Cancel, and then change the
  number at the end of the following line to 1:

  SP_DISPLAY_CHEAT_WARNINGS=0

11. On the File menu, click Exit. When you are prompted to save the changes,
  click Yes.

When you play a multiplayer game in Combat Flight Simulator after you follow
these steps, you see the following message when any player enters the suspended
state

  &lt;Player&gt; has entered a suspended state.

where &lt;Player&gt; is the name of a pilot in the multiplayer session. If a
player enters the suspended state more than twice in a single game, Combat
Flight Simulator displays an asterisk (*) beside that player's score.

The following table lists some of the commands and actions in a multiplayer game
that can start and stop the suspended state.
