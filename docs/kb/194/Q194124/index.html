SYMPTOMS
========

When connecting to an Excel Spreadsheet using the DAO OpenRecordset method, some
values in an Excel column may be returned as Null when the underlying value is
not a Null. This typically occurs when numeric and text datatypes are intermixed
within the same Excel column.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by a limitation of the Excel ISAM driver in that once it
determines the datatype of an Excel column, it will return a Null for any value
that is not of the datatype the ISAM driver has defaulted to for that Excel
column. The Excel ISAM driver determines the datatype of an Excel column by
examining the actual values in the first few rows and then chooses a datatype
that represents the majority of the values in its sampling.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two workarounds for this behavior:

1. Insure that the data in Excel is entered as text. Just reformatting the Excel
  column to Text will not accomplish this. You must re-enter the existing
  values after reformatting the Excel column. In Excel, you can use F5 to
  re-enter existing values in the selected cell.

2. You can add the option IMEX=1; to the Excel connect string in the
  OpenDatabase method. For example:

        Set Db = OpenDatabase("C:\Temp\Book1.xls", _
              False, True, "Excel 8.0; HDR=NO; IMEX=1;")

  NOTE: Setting IMEX=1 tells the driver to use Import mode. In this state, the
  registry setting ImportMixedTypes=Text will be noticed. This forces mixed
  data to be converted to text. For this to work reliably, you may also have to
  modify the registry setting, TypeGuessRows=8. The ISAM driver by default
  looks at the first eight rows and from that sampling determines the datatype.
  If this eight row sampling is all numeric, then setting IMEX=1 will not
  convert the default datatype to Text; it will remain numeric.

  You must be careful that IMEX=1 not be used indiscriminately. This is IMPORT
  mode, so the results may be unpredictable if you try to do appends or updates
  of data in this mode.

  The possible settings of IMEX are:

       0 is Export mode
       1 is Import mode
       2 is Linked mode (full update capabilities)

  The registry key where the settings described above are located is:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Jet\3.5\Engines\Excel

  See the REFERENCES section of this article for information on when the Excel
  spreadsheet has text column headers with numeric data.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

To duplicate this problem, first create an Excel Workbook with a default Sheet1
spreadsheet. In the first column of Sheet1, enter the following values - 123,
aaa, 456, bbb, 789. Save this Workbook in your C:\Temp directory, and name it
Book1.XLS.

In Visual Basic, create a new Standard EXE project and follow these steps:

1. Make a reference to Microsoft DAO 3.5 Object Library. In Visual Basic 6.0,
  this will be Microsoft DAO 3.51 Object Library.

2. Add a CommandButton to the new Form.

3. Place the following code in the Form's General Declarations section:

        Dim Db As Database
        Dim Rs As Recordset

        Private Sub Command1_Click()
            Set Rs = Db.OpenRecordset("Sheet1$")
            'This will print the spreadsheet Text values as Nulls.

            Do While Not Rs.EOF
                Debug.Print Rs(0)
                Rs.MoveNext
            Loop

        End Sub

        Private Sub Form_Load()
            'HDR refers to the Excel header row.
        Set Db = OpenDatabase("C:\Temp\Book1.xls", _
                 False, True, "Excel 8.0; HDR=NO;")

        End Sub

        Private Sub Form_Unload(Cancel As Integer)
            Db.Close
            Set Db = Nothing

        End Sub

  Run the Project by pressing the F5 key and note that in the Debug window the
  text values are printed as Null. If the majority of the values in the Excel
  Spreadsheet were text, then the result from the code above would be reversed.
  That is, the numeric values would come back as Nulls.
