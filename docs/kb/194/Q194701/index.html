-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Age of Empires, version 1.0 
- Microsoft Age of Empires Expansion: The Rise of Rome, version 1.0 
- Microsoft Age of Empires, Gold Edition 
- Microsoft Age of Empires II Expansion: The Conquerors 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you play a multiplayer game on one of the Microsoft Age of Empires games
listed at the beginning of this article, you may receive one of the following
error messages:

  Game stopped because it was out of sync!

  -OR-

  You were dropped from the game because of a sync error. Your network
  connection may have been lost.

NOTE: This occurs when playing the multiplayer game types listed below.

- On the MSN Gaming Zone (one.com)

- IPX/SPX local Area Network

- TCP/IP Local Area Network

- Serial Connection

- Modem to Modem Connection

CAUSE
=====

This error message can occur if any of the following conditions is true:

- The player is using a Trainer program.

- The processor (CPU) installed in the computer is configured to use an
  incorrect clock speed (Overclocked).

- A Realtek RTL 8029 network adapter is installed in your computer and the
  network adapter drivers are out of date.

- You are connecting through a proxy server and the proxy settings in Internet
  Explorer are incorrect or set to use an Automatic Configuration Script.


RESOLUTION
==========

The Player is using a Trainer Program
-------------------------------------

Do not use a trainer program while playing any of the games listed above.

More Information:

A trainer program is a program that runs in the background that allows a player
to have functionality that is not normally built into Age of Empires. While
these programs are not necessarily cheats, they can still cause these
synchronization errors because they tend to "piggyback" on the data packets.
These programs are too numerous to list as they can be made by anyone that knows
how to code.

It is important to note that these "trainer" programs, no matter what they are
used for, are not supported or endorsed by Microsoft.

For additional information about using Trainer programs in Age of Empires, click
the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q250837 AOE: Age Of Empires Update Is Available

The Processor (CPU) Is Configured to Use an Incorrect Clock Speed (Overclocked)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Set the motherboard bus speed and multiplier to settings recommended by the
manufacturer.

More Information:

Often the Motherboard and processor can be pushed beyond its factory limitations.
While in theory this sounds like a benefit, overclocking will severely limit the
life of the processor. Overclocking a CPU can cause many strange anomalies since
you are not only overclocking the processor but putting all of your devices at
risk as well.

Overclocking can be undone either in the system BIOS or via a combination of
jumper or dipswitches on the computer's Motherboard.

For more information about how to set up the processor for recommended use,
please contact the Motherboard manufacturer or your OEM.

appropriate article number in the following list to view the article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q60782 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, Q-Z


You are Using A Realtek RTL 8029 Network Adapter with an Outdated Driver
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Download the Latest Driver for your network adapter.

To download the latest driver for your Realtek RTL 8029 network adapter, visit
the following Realtek Web site:

  http://www.realtek.com.tw


More Information:

There is one version of this chipset that is incompatible with Windows XP. For
more information, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/hcl/default.asp

This particular adapter is often an onboard Network Adapter.

There was a network incompatibility in this particular Network adapter's older
drivers. Newer drivers usually fix this error.

Connecting Through a Proxy Server and the Proxy settings in Internet Explorer are Incorrect or Set to Use an Automatic Configuration Script
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contacy your Internet Service Provider (ISP) for the correct proxy settings.

If your ISP supports automatic proxy detection, set Internet Explorer to
automatically detect proxy settings instead of running a configuration script.

To set Internet Explorer to automatically detect proxy settings:

Internet Explorer 5 or Later:

1. Open Internet Explorer, and then click Tools.

2. Click Internet Options.

3. On the Connection tab, click LAN Settings.

4. Click to clear the Use Automatic Configuration Script check box.

5. Select the Automatically Detect Settings check box.

6. Click OK, click OK again, and then restart Internet Explorer.

For additional information about how to play multiplayer games through a firewall
or Proxy Server, click the article numbers below to view the articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q240429 DirectX: Ports Required to Play on a Network

  Q159031 Zone: Connecting to the Zone Through a Firewall or Proxy Server

More Information:

The appropriate ports and settings must be present on your ISP's end as well as
your own (if you are using a firewall). It is important to note that many
antivirus software installation packages also install their own version of a
firewall and they are often set to their most restrictive settings. Please
contact your firewall/antivirus program manufacturer for help configuring their
software.

Sometimes a proxy client will configure your browser to use an automatic
configuration script. This can interfere with the network traffic that a DirectX
game requires and cause a sync error.
