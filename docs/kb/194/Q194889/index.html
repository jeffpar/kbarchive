SUMMARY
=======

Sgcinst.exe is a command-line tool that is used when installing Server Gated
Cryptography certificates into Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS).
Sgcinst.exe converts vendors' Server-Gated Cryptography certificates into a
format that can be imported into IIS.

Sgcinst.exe is available at the following Internet location:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/misc/sgcinst/

MORE INFORMATION
================

Installing an SGC Certificate with current versions of IIS may require a two
step process. Verisign and other Certificate Authorities (CAs) currently issuing
server identification Certificates return the server Certificate as a base-64
encoded x.509v3 Certificate. The released version of IIS Key Manager is designed
to accept these and install them for IIS use.

To more effectively control issuance of the SGC Certificates, Verisign has
created an intermediate, or issuing, CA for SGC Certificates. This requires a
Certificate chain be returned to the IIS computer. This chain includes both the
SGC server Certificate and the intermediate CA Certificate in a base-64 encoded
PKCS-7 data structure. With current IIS releases, this must be pre-processed
prior to installing the SGC server Certificate using IIS Key Manager.

The program Sgcinst.exe performs the required pre-processing. It accepts a
base-64 encoded PKCS-7 data structure, installs the intermediate CA Certificate,
and creates a base-64 encoded x.509v3 Certificate file containing only the SGC
server Certificate. This output file may then be loaded for IIS using Key
Manager.

The process for installing an SGC server Certificate from Verisign, or other CA
returning a PKCS-7 Certificate chain, is as follows:

1. Retrieve the PKCS-7 Certificate chain from the CA and save it to a temporary
  folder on the IIS computer. It is recommended this be saved with a .pk7
  extension.

2. Run the Sgcinst.exe program with the PKCS-7 Certificate chain file as the
  inputfile and a filename to hold the base-64 encoded x.509v3 SGC server
  Certificate as the outputfile.

  To do this, open a Command Prompt window on the Windows NT server computer, go
  to the folder containing the Certificate files, and then enter the following
  command:

     sgcinst inputfile -i -o outputfile

  where:

     inputfile  = file containing the base-64 encoded PKCS-7 Certificate
                  chain
     outputfile = file which will hold the base-64 encoded x.509v3 SGC
                  server Certificate

  If the CA Certificate chain had been saved to a file named Sgccert.pk7, then
  the SGCINST command would be:

     sgcinst sgccert.pk7 -i -o sgccert.cer

  If the inputfile is not a properly formatted base-64 encoded PKCS-7, the
  program will return the following error message:

  Error in reading input file: inputfile

3. Install the base-64 encoded x.509v3 SGC server Certificate using the IIS Key
  Manager. See your IIS documentation if you need assistance with this
  operation.
