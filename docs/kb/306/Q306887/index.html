-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Windows 2000 Application event log may be populated with several event 2002
Perfproc errors that have the following (or similar) description:

  Unable to open the job object Winlogon Job 0-13f0822 for query access. The
  calling process may not have permission to open this Job. The status returned
  is data DWORD 0. For more information, see Help and Support Center at
  http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/events.asp.

CAUSE
=====

Perfproc.dll logs the 2002 event error when it cannot open a job object. Refer
to the "More Information" section for additional information.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows 2000. For
additional information, click the following article number to view the article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q260910 How to Obtain the Latest Windows 2000 Service Pack

Perfproc.dll was modified to call OpenJobObject using the full path in the object
name space from the \BaseNamedObjects path.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date        Time     Version       Size    File name
  ----------------------------------------------------
  12-Feb-2002 04:48PM  5.0.2195.3990 28,944  Perfproc.dll


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Windows 2000 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A job object allows groups of processes to be managed as a unit. In this case,
Perfproc cannot open the Winlogon job object because no user is logged on to the
console and a process that is running as a service or in a terminal server
session requests process performance data (which is implemented in
Perfproc.dll). The open process fails on the Winlogon job object because
Perfproc.dll calls OpenJobObject with the job name instead of with the full path
to the job. When OpenJobObject is called with a job name instead of the full
path to the job in the object name space, it looks for the job under the running
processes session sub-tree which will fail if there is no user logged on to the
console.
