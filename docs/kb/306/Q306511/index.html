SYMPTOMS
========

If you schedule an advertisement for a package with a dependency and the
advertisement is scheduled to run at the next logon, this process works
correctly. However, if before the next logon, another advertisement (which might
be totally unrelated to the first advertisement) is sent to the same computer
and is started before the first advertisement starts (because the computer has
not yet been restarted), the second advertisement runs normally. After this
occurs, the advertisement that is scheduled for the next logon will incorrectly
start even though a new logon has not yet happened. This occurs even though
advertisements should run according to the schedule that is set when the
advertisement is configured.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by the trigger list for Advertised Program Manager being
incorrectly re-evaluated when the second advertisement starts.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
