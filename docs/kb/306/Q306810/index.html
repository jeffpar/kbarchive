-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Outlook 98 Deployment Kit 
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For a Microsoft Outlook 98 Deployment Kit English version of this article, see Q220923.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Japanese Outlook Deployment Kit to create Microsoft Outlook 98
foreign language deployment packages, package creation may fail with the
following error message:

  The Outlook 98 Deployment Wizard was unable to generate a customized version
  of Outlook. Either an error has occurred, or the user pressed Cancel

CAUSE
=====

When the Odklang.exe file copies files from the CD, it is preserving the
read-only attribute of most of the files. When the ODK wizard tries to build a
custom package, it has problems with the read-only state of some of the files.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem.

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information on support costs, please go to the following address on the World
Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The Japanese version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date        Time   Version      Size     File name  
  ----------------------------------------------------
  08/29/2001  4:05a  8.50.0.5620   65,536  Odklang.exe
  08/28/1998  8:19a  4.0.0.2926   402,481  Scrrun.dll



WORKAROUND
==========

Remove all read-only attributes of the files that are copied by Odklang.exe.
