-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Splits property, if you set the ScrollBar property to
dbgAutomatic, the DataGrid control may repaint itself continuously.

This behavior causes CPU utilization to remain at 100 percent. Under certain
circumstances, you receive the following error message:

  Run-time Error 28 "Out of Stack Space"

The application quits, and the Visual Basic Integrated Development Environment
(IDE) closes unexpectedly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, set the ScrollBar property for each Splits property
to dbgBoth.

If you set ScrollBar to dbgAutomatic, dbgNone, or dbgVertical, the grid is
displayed and continuously repainted until you receive the "Out of Stack Space"
error message. If you use the dbgHorizontal setting, you do not receive the same
error message consistently. If you use the dbgHorizontal setting, sometimes the
CPU utilization remains at 100 percent.

You can use the property pages of the DataGrid control to change the ScrollBar
property at design time. You can also set this property in code before you
display the DataGrid.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. On the Project menu, click References, and select the Microsoft ActiveX Data
  Objects Library check box.

3. On the Project menu, click Components, and then select the following
  components:

   - Microsoft DataGrid Control 6.0 (OLEDB)
   - Microsoft ADO Data Control 6.0 (OLEDB)

4. Place an ADO Data Control on Form1. Adodc1 is added by default. Set the
  following properties for Adodc1:

  ConnectionString: Type a valid Northwind database connection
  CursorLocation: adUseClient
  RecordSource: SELECT * FROM Employees

5. Place a DataGrid on Form1. DataGrid1 is added by default. Set the following
  properties for DataGrid1:

  DataSource: Adodc1

6. Place a Command button on Form1. Command1 is added by default. Add the
  following code to Form1:

   Option Explicit

     Private Sub Command1_Click()
        Dim I As Integer
        
        With DataGrid1
           For I = 1 To .Splits(0).Columns.Count - 1
              .Splits(0).Columns(I).Visible = False
           Next I
           .Splits.Add (1)
           '.Splits(0).ScrollBars = dbgBoth
           
           .Splits(1).Columns(0).Visible = False
           For I = 1 To .Splits(1).Columns.Count - 1
              .Splits(1).Columns(I).Visible = True
           Next I
           
           '.Splits(1).ScrollBars = dbgBoth
        End With
     End Sub

     Private Sub Form_Load()
        Command1.Caption = "Show Split"
     End Sub

7. Run the code. Click Show Split to split the grid.

  Notice that CPU utilization is 100 percent, and the DataGrid flickers. If you
  try to size the grid, the scroll bar may redraw incorrectly. You receive the
  above-mentioned error message, and the Visual Basic IDE stops responding and
  then closes unexpectedly.

8. Stop the application, and uncomment the two lines that explicitly set the
  ScrollBar property of each of the splits.

  '.Splits(0).ScrollBars = dbgBoth

  -and-

  '.Splits(1).ScrollBars = dbgBoth

9. Run the application again. Notice that the grid is split properly.
