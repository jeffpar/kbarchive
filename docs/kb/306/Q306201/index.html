SYMPTOMS
========

You sign in to MSN Messenger. Once signed in, you go to http://www.hotmail.com
and sign in using a different account than the one you used to signed in to MSN
Messenger. At the Hotmail Web site, you click the Address Book tab. You click
the Create New button to create a new contact in the Address Book. You complete
the information on the form that appears, and you specify a valid Hotmail.com or
MSN.com address in the Address box. You click the OK button at the bottom of the
page. The contact is added to the Address Book of the account you used to sign
in to the Hotmail Web site. However, the account will also be added as a contact
in the contact list of the account you used to sign in to MSN Messenger.

CAUSE
=====

This is a known issue.

RESOLUTION
==========

This issue will be resolved in a future release of MSN Messenger. If you do not
want the contact in your MSN Messenger contact list, you can delete the entry by
selecting the contact in the Messenger window, clicking File on the top menu,
then clicking Delete Contact.
