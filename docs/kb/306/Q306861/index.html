SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the steps that are necessary to make a Remote Access
connection to a remote server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before you can create a Remote Access connection to a remote server, you must
know the following information:

- The remote server's phone number.

- Your username and password for accessing the remote server.

- The network protocols installed on the remote server.

- The type of remote server you want to connect to (such as Windows for
  Workgroups and Windows NT 3.1; NetWare Connect [NRN]; or Windows 95, Windows
  98, Windows 98 Second edition, Windows NT Server 3.5, or Internet [PPP]).

To create a Dial-Up Networking connection

1. Click the Open Apple, select Control Panel, then select Remote Access.

2. From the File menu, select Configurations.
  This displays the list of existing configurations.

To modify an existing configuration

- Select the connection from the list, and then click the Make Active button.

To create a new configuration

1. Select an existing configuration, and then click the Duplicate button.

2. Click the Rename button to give the new configuration a unique name.

3. Click the Make Active button.
  The Remote Access control panel contains the following:
   - User name (for your Internet Service Provider [ISP] account)

   - Password (for your ISP account)

   - Access phone number (access number for your ISP)

  If you make any changes you are prompted to save them when closing the Remote
  Access control panel.

4. Click the Remote Access menu while the Remote Access control panel is open.
  This menu lists several other control panels. The other control panels of
  interest for configuring an ISP connection are Modem and TCP/IP.

5. Double-click the Modem control panel.
  Note: The Configurations option described above in the Remote Access control
  panel are also available in the Modem control panel.

6. Select the port that the modem is connected to in the Connect via: menu.

7. Select the modem script in the Modem: menu.
  Leave the other settings as they are.

8. Double-click the TCP/IP control panel and make the following selections:
   - Connect via: For most ISPs this should be set to PPP.

   - Configure: For most ISPs this should be set to Using PPP Server.

Note: The Configurations option described above in the Remote Access control
panel is also available in the TCP/IP control panel.

The Apple Location Manager 2.0 provides a convenient way of grouping the settings
in the Remote Access and TCP/IP control panels. For further information open the
Location Manager and click the question mark for online help.
