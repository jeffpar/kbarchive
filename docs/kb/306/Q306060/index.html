SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Mailbox Cleanup Agent (MBClean) may fail to properly
notify users when it has cleaned their mailbox. This behavior can occur if
MBClean's own mailbox is over the quota limit specified for the information
store. This condition may also cause MBClean to prematurely stop cleaning
mailboxes. The following two errors in the event log may indicate this problem:

  Event Type: Error
  Event Source: MSExchangeMCA
  Event Category: None
  Event ID: 706
  Date: 6/26/2001
  Time: 7:15:00 PM
  User: N/A
  Computer: SERVERNAME
  Description:
  Failed to process users in container /o=Organization/ou=Site/cn=Recipients.

  Event Type: Error
  Event Source: MSExchangeMCA
  Event Category: None
  Event ID: 721
  Date: 6/26/2001
  Time: 7:15:00 PM
  User: N/A
  Computer: SERVERNAME
  Description:
  Microsoft Exchange Server Mailbox Manager was interrupted before processing
  was complete - error no = 80004005.The Microsoft Exchange Server Mailbox
  Manager has completed processing mailboxes

  Started at: 04/30/01 15:33:36

  Mailboxes processed: 267
  Messages moved: 532
  Size of moved messages: 18.00 MB
  Deleted messages: 17
  Size of deleted messages: 52.00 KB

CAUSE
=====

The MBClean mailbox has exceeded its mailbox size limit, as specified by the
information store settings. When MBClean tries to submit a message to notify a
user that their mailbox has been cleaned, the information store returns the
error 0x4D9, which is ecQuotaExceeded. This error is returned as 0x80004005
(MAPI_E_CALL_FAILED), which is logged in event 721 above.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this behavior, MBClean has been modified to permanently delete any
messages in its Inbox folder upon starting the service. Also, MBClean will set
the incoming size limit for the mailbox to 0 to prevent any further messages
from being delivered. The mailbox is also configured to not use the information
store storage limit defaults.

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: MBClean

+---------------------------+
| File name   | Version     | 
+---------------------------+
| Mbclean.exe | 5.5.2655.34 | 
+---------------------------+

NOTE: Due to file dependencies, this hotfix requires Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 4.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine if the MBClean mailbox is over its size limit:

1. In the Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5. Administrator program, locate the
  Mailbox Resources object under the Private Information Store object.

2. Add the Storage Limits column to the view. For more information on how to
  perform this step, please refer to the following article:

  Q260184 XADM: How to Add Storage Limits Columns for Mailboxes

3. Find the mailbox with the display name "Microsoft Exchange Server Mailbox
  Manager for &lt;ServerName&gt;, where &lt;ServerName&gt; is the name of the
  server on which MBClean is running.

The Storage Limits column for this mailbox will display "Prohibit Send" or
"Mailbox Disabled," depending on the information store storage limits that are
configured. If either setting is displayed, MBClean may not correctly send
status messages to the users to inform them that their mailbox was cleaned.
