-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 2000 SP2 Server 
- Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Windows 2000 Service Pack 2 to your Windows 2000 Server-based
computer, one or more of the following events may be logged to the Application
Event log, and these events may be logged multiple times:

  Event: 2075
  Source: MsExchangeDSAccess
  Description: Process MAD.EXE" (PID=1392) DsBind failed name of your server,
  hr=0x80070862, deltaT=109. The operation will be retried.

  Event: 2075
  Source: MsExchangeDSAccess
  Description: Process INETINFO.EXE (PID=1276) DsBind failed name of your
  server, hr=0x80070862, deltaT=110. The operation will be retried.

  Event: 2064
  Source: MSExchangeDSAccess
  Description: Process MAD.EXE" (PID=1392) All the remote DS Servers in use are
  not responding.

  Event: 2064
  Source: MSExchangeDSAccess
  Description: Process INETINFO.EXE (PID=1676) All the remote DS Servers in use
  are not responding.

  Event: 2064
  Source: MSExchangeDSAccess
  Description: Process WINMGMT.EXE (PID=1516) All the remote DS Servers in use
  are not responding.

  Event: 2064
  Source: MSExchangeDSAccess
  Description: Process STORE.EXE" (PID=3268) All the remote DS Servers in use
  are not responding.

NOTE: The PID number varies on individual servers.


CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because of the timing of the individual services that are
shutting down during the server shutdown process. To verify that these events
are being logged at server shutdown and not during boot-up or some other time:

1. Shut down the server.

2. Make a note of the time, wait a few minutes, and then restart the server.

3. Check the Application Event Log, and then compare the time of the 2075 and
  2064 events to the time that you noted in step 2. In most cases, the time
  that the events are logged will have occurred before system startup.

WORKAROUND
==========

To prevent these error messages from being logged:

1. Click Start, point to Program Files, point to Administrative Tools, and then
  click Services.

2. Right-click Microsoft Exchange System Attendant, and then click Stop.

3. When you are prompted to stop other services, click Yes.

4. Right-click IIS Admin Service, and then click Stop.

5. When you are prompted to stop other services, click Yes.

6. Shut down or restart the server.

======
