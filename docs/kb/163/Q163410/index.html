SUMMARY
=======

There may be times you want to create run-time applications that include
Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, Microsoft PowerPoint presentations, or Microsoft
Word documents using the ODE Setup Wizard. This article demonstrates how to
create custom applications that you can distribute to other users who don't have
Microsoft Excel, Word, or PowerPoint on their computers. One way this can be
done is by adding the application's viewer files to the Setup Wizard program
when you are creating your distribution disks.

NOTE: Using the methods described in this article, your users will only be able
to view your Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, Word documents, or PowerPoint
presentations. They will not be able to make any modifications to the files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To create a custom application that you can distribute to other users, include
the correct viewer files for the particular application in the ODE Setup Wizard.
The files you will need to add to the Setup wizard depends on the types of files
you want to distribute.

For example, if you want to distribute Microsoft Excel spreadsheets, you will
need to obtain the files for the Microsoft Excel Viewer. The Microsoft Excel
viewer enables users to view Microsoft Excel spreadsheets without having
Microsoft Excel on their computers. This viewer is available on the Microsoft
web at:

  http://www.microsoft.com/office/excel/downloads/default.htm

If you want to distribute PowerPoint presentations or Word documents, you can
obtain the Word and PowerPoint viewers from the ValuPack folder that is included
in the Microsoft Office 97, Professional Edition package. The viewer files are
in the subfolder Ppt4view for the PowerPoint files and Wordview for the Word
files.

Creating a Distributable Application for Microsoft Excel Files
--------------------------------------------------------------

To create a distributable custom Setup program for your Microsoft Excel
spreadsheets, do the following:

1. Download the Microsoft Excel Viewer files from the Microsoft Web Site at:

  http://www.microsoft.com/office/excel/downloads/default.htm

2. After you have run the setup file xlViewer.exe to install the Microsoft Excel
  viewer on your computer, start the ODE Setup Wizard program.

3. In the ODE Setup wizard, on the Add files screen, add the following files and
  any Microsoft Excel spreadsheet files you want to distribute to the List Of
  Files box:

  - XL5EN32.OLB
  - XLINTL32.DLL
  - XLKEY32.DLL
  - XLVIEW.EXE
  - XLVIEW1.REG
  - XLVIEW2.REG
  - XLVIEW3.REG

  NOTE: These files can be found in the folder where you installed the Microsoft
  Excel viewer files.

4. Select Xlview.exe in the List Of Files box, and then click to select the "Set
  as Application's Main File" check box. Click Next.

5. On the Add Shortcuts screen, click Add, and then type a description for your
  shortcut in the Description box. Leave the default "I would like to use a
  wizard-provided command line" option selected on the General Shortcut
  Properties tab. Click Next three times.

6. In the "What is the name of your application" box, type the name you want to
  give to your new Microsoft Excel viewer application. Fill in the rest of the
  information as needed for your particular application. Click Next twice.

7. On the screen marked "Where do you want the Setup Wizard to copy the files
  for your custom Setup program," accept the default for the folder your disk
  images will be copied to in the "The Setup Wizard creates a folder for each
  of your disk images within the folder you specify" box.

8. Select the option for the type(s) of distribution disks you want to create.
  Click Finish.

At this point, the ODE Setup Wizard creates the disk images for your application.
Once the disk images are created, you can run your custom Setup program on any
computer. Users of your spreadsheets who do not have Microsoft Excel can view
them through the Microsoft Excel viewer.

For more information about using the Microsoft Excel viewer, read the following
files that are installed when you download xlViewer.EXE in the folder where you
have installed Xlview.exe:
