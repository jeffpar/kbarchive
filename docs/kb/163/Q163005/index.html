The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP2 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Compaq Advanced Network Control utility included on Compaq's support
software disk (SSD) 1.18 or later (up to SSD 1.20a at the time this article was
written) fails to work properly after applying Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2.
The utility starts up after some time, but does not have all the information it
had before the service pack was applied. The utility fails whether it is
installed before or after the service pack has been applied. Removing the
service pack causes the utility to start working correctly again.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, do either of the following:

- Obtain the hotfix mentioned in the STATUS section of this article.

  -or-

- Use the Netflx3.sys driver that comes with the Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 2
  media. There is a new Netflx3.sys driver (version 1.51) in the
  Drvlib\Netcard\Netflx3 directory. Because this is a Drvlib (OEM) driver,
  there is no mechanism to automatically update the service pack installation
  with the new driver. In other words, you must manually copy the Netflx3.sys
  driver that comes with the service pack to the target system. When this is
  done, the Compaq utility works as expected.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0 Service
Pack 2.

A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression- tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.



MORE INFORMATION
================

The Compaq Advanced Network Utility uses a graphical user interface (GUI) that
allows a user to install, configure, update, and monitor the status of all
Compaq network controllers containing the TLAN chip set. It uses the Netflx3.sys
file to configure network controllers for redundancy or stand- alone
configurations.
