-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A form containing the Treeview control suddenly loses the images shown in the
Treeview. This happens after any property of the Treeview control was modified
in the Form Designer.

CAUSE
=====

Right-clicking on the Treeview control in the Form Designer reveals a context
menu. The bottom bar of that menu opens the TreeCtrl Properties dialog box. That
dialog box holds a PageFrame with three pages. Page 1 has the caption "General."
It holds a stack of nine ComboBox controls, plus other objects. The fifth
ComboBox from the top is labeled "ImageList" (without the quotes).

Comctl32.ocx contains both the ImageList control and the Treeview control.

With the version of Comctl32.ocx that originally came with Visual FoxPro 5.0 the
ImageList to be used with the Treeview control could be selected from that
ComboBox on the General page of the TreeCtrl Properties dialog box. The
developer could drop the ComboBox down and see all of the ImageList controls on
the current form. Typically that would be one, but the application design might
require multiple ImageLists. A Treeview can be associated with any one of those,
but only one.

Several Microsoft developer products that have been released since the release of
Visual FoxPro version 5.0 install a revised Comctl32.ocx.

In the Form Designer of Visual FoxPro 5.0, the new version of Treeview no longer
lists, in the TreeCtrl properties general page, the ImageLists that reside on
the current form. It shows the expression &lt;none&gt;.

Clicking the "Apply" button at the bottom of the page sets all of the properties
to the settings shown, so the new ImageList property is "none."

RESOLUTION
==========

The ImageList must be specified in code. For example, if the form has an
ImageList in OLE container control "OleControl1," then in the Init event method
for the OLE container control that holds the Treeview, add a command similar to
the following:

  

     This.Object.Imagelist = Thisform.Olecontrol1.Object

The above is only a suggestion. The specifics of the application determines where
to make the modification and the appropriate syntax to use.

NOTE: The symptoms listed in this article also apply to the ListView control. The
code for a workaround using the ListView control follows:

  

     This.object.icon = thisform.olecontrol1.object
     This.object.smallicon = thisform.olecontrol2.object

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

Use the following steps in Microsoft Visual FoxPro 5.0 for Windows:

1. Modify a form that contains a TreeCtrl control.

2. Modify any property of the Treeview within the TreeCtrl properties dialog box

3. Click Apply, then OK. The value "&lt;none&gt;" is now saved as the ImageList
  property. Consequently no ImageList is specified for the Treeview
