The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry. Before
you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if a problem
occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring the Registry"
Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key" Help topic in
Regedt32.exe.

When you open or receive mail in the Microsoft Exchange client, one of the
following error messages may occur:

  Exchng32.exe - No Disk
  There is no disk in the drive. Please insert a disk into &lt;drive&gt;:

  -or-

  WMS Spooler: Mapisp32.exe - No Disk

  -or-

  OleMainThreadWndName: Mapisp32.exe - No Disk

NOTE: If you select the Abort option, the message box clears. Selecting Retry or
Ignore only works if a floppy disk is inserted into the drive.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the PATH statement in the Autoexec.bat file, Windows NT
System Environment Variables, or User Environment Variables for &lt;user
name&gt; refers to a floppy disk drive or CD-ROM drive.

If the Autoexec.bat file refers to a floppy disk or CD-ROM drive, Windows NT 4.0
does not display the error when you log on, but when you run applications.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you should either have a disk in the drive or
remove the entry from the PATH statement.

The drive letter may not be entered in the PATH statement, but may be found in
the following registry location:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\SETUP\WinntPath

Delete the entry here and log back in.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a user logs on to their account, Windows NT searches for an Autoexec.bat
file in the root directory of drive C. If the file is found, Ntvdm.exe appends
its PATH environment variable to the system PATH environment variable. Only the
DOS virtual machine (VDM) PATH variable is affected.

Ntvdm.exe tests the PATH statement for validity. If the drive physically exists,
Ntvdm.exe tests for the drive type (removable media or fixed). If the drive is a
floppy disk or CD-ROM, Ntvdm.exe tests for the presence of valid media. If no
valid media is found, the error message is displayed. If invalid drives are used
in the Autoexec.bat PATH statement, no error message is displayed; however, the
PATH variable in any previously opened VDMs may be invalid.

For more information, please see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q102418 NTVDM Error: There Is No Disk in the Drive


This problem can also occur after you save an attachment to removable media, and
then eject the media. For example, when you save an attachment to a zip drive,
and then eject the disk and attempt to open another message, the error message
appears. To work around this problem, insert a new disk in to the same drive and
open a message.
