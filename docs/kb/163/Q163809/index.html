SYMPTOMS
========

If your Visual Basic for Applications macro contains a line to change ExtendMode
to "On" (True), when the macro ends, Extend Mode is turned "Off" (it is set back
to False).

NOTE: In earlier versions of Microsoft Word, extend selection mode remained on,
upon completion of the macro.

CAUSE
=====

This functionality is by design. The following sample Visual Basic for
Applications macro demonstrates this behavior by changing extend selection mode
to "On":

  Sub TurnExtendModeOn()
     Selection.ExtendMode = True
     Msgbox "Extend Mode is On."
  End Sub

When the macro ends, extend selection mode will be turned "Off".
