- MSPRESS PC 97 Hardware Design Guide ISBN 1-57231-381-1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article contains comments, corrections, and information on known errors
relating to the Microsoft Press book "PC 97 Hardware Design Guide."

The following topic is covered:

- CD-ROM index.htm contents frame is broken

MORE INFORMATION
================

CD-ROM Index.htm Contents Frame Is Broken
-----------------------------------------

The Index.htm file on the companion CD-ROM for this book does not show a list of
CD-ROM contents along the left edge of the HTML page.

The missing table of contents is caused by incorrectly interpreted HTML code in
the Index.htm. Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.01 is affected by this issue. Other
Web browsers might be similarly affected.

Correction:

Microsoft Press has created a correction CD-ROM to address this issue. The
original CD-ROM has already been replaced in most of the first printing of this
book, and is available to customers as a replacement CD-ROM.

In the United States, a correction CD-ROM can be ordered free of charge by
calling the Microsoft Order Desk at (800) 360-7561 and requesting part number
097-0001603. Outside the United States, please contact your local Microsoft
Press distributor for replacement CD-ROM information. A list of international
Microsoft Press distributors can be found on the Microsoft Press Web site at
this address:

  http://www.microsoft.com/mspress/

If you have any problems obtaining the correction CD-ROM, please e-mail

  MSPINPUT@MICROSOFT.COM.

WORKAROUND
==========

Without the corrected CD-ROM, the only workaround is to copy the TOC subfolder
and all files in the root directory of the CD-ROM to a folder on a hard disk.
This set of files is less than 2.5 MB.

To copy the CD-ROM, use the following steps:

Copy the root directory files and the TOC subfolder:

1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, and then click Windows Explorer.

2. Place the "PC 97 Hardware Design Guide" companion compact disc in the CD-ROM
  drive.

3. In the all folders pane, double-click the CD-ROM drive icon (typically drive
  D). You may need to scroll down the all folders pane to view the CD-ROM drive
  icon.

4. On the Edit menu, click Select All to select all of the files and folders in
  the contents pane.

5. Press and hold the CTRL key and click the IE30 folder icon at the top of the
  list in the contents pane. This will cancel the selection of the IE30 folder.

6. On the Edit menu, click Copy.

Paste copied files to a new hard disk folder:

1. In the all folders pane, click the icon of the hard disk that you want to
  copy the files to (typically drive C).

2. On the File menu, point to New, and then click Folder. A New Folder box will
  appear in the contents pane.

3. Type "PC97_HDG" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER to name the new
  folder.

4. Double-click the PC97_HDG folder in the contents pane.

5. On the Edit menu, click Paste to paste all the files that you copied from the
  compact disc.

After you paste the CD-ROM files to your hard disk using the copy and paste
procedures, you can view the online Hardware Design Guide using Windows
Explorer. To do this, double-click the Index.htm file that is now located in the
C:\PC97_HDG folder.

Please e-mail MSPINPUT@MICROSOFT.COM if you have any questions or comments
regarding this issue.

Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
already contain most or all of the above corrections.
