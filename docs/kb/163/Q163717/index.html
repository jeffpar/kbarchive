-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.


SYMPTOMS
========

When you insert a Microsoft ActiveX Slider control version 5.0 into a form in
Microsoft Access 97 and then preview the form, the Slider control may not be
displayed as expected.

NOTE: The Microsoft ActiveX Slider control version 5.0 is included in the
Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools package. It is not included in the
Microsoft Office 97, Professional Edition or the Microsoft Access 97 stand-alone
package.

CAUSE
=====

How the Slider control is displayed in Print Preview will depend on the printer
driver you are using. Some printer drivers cause certain ActiveX controls, such
as the Slider control, to look different when you view them in Print preview.
This will usually be more common in some laserjet printer drivers, dot matrix
printer drivers, and Generic/text only drivers.

RESOLUTION
==========

To make an ActiveX control image display more clearly in Print Preview, use a
color printer driver or a postscript printer driver. Certain laserjet and
deskjet printer drivers work well also.

You may also need to change some of the properties for the printer driver you are
using. For example, if you are using an HP Laserjet 4 Plus printer driver, you
will need to change the graphics dithering in order to get a clearer display of
the control in Print Preview. These options can be set on the Graphics tab in
the Printer Properties dialog box in Control Panel.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft Access 97.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. In Control Panel, add the HP Laserjet 4 Plus driver to the list of printers.
  Set this as your default printer and do the following:

  a. On the File menu, click Properties.

  b. On the Graphics tab, select 600 dots per inch in the Resolution box and
     click Coarse in the Dithering option box. Click Apply, and then click OK
     to close the Printer Properties box.

2. Create a new form in Microsoft Access 97.

3. Insert the Microsoft Slider version 5.0 ActiveX control into the form. Resize
  the control to make it larger.

4. On the File menu, click Print Preview. Note that the Microsoft Slider ActiveX
  control displays with black dots on a white background.
