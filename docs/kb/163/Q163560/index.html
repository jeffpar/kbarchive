-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, on platform(s):
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You may observe problems when an SLI application issues an SLI_OPEN followed by
an SLI_CLOSE followed by another SLI_OPEN, all in quick succession. Due to the
sequence of messages on the server, the client SLI_OPEN call sometimes returns
before the SNA Server service sends the NOTIFY(enabled) request to the host.
This causes the SLI application to not receive the host logon screen (on the
SSCP-LU session) as it expects.

This problem can be further complicated in an environment where the host sends a
logon screen before it receives a response to the previous logon screen.

CAUSE
=====

Because a client SLI_OPEN is completing before the SNA Server sends a
NOTIFY(enabled) to the host, the host logon screen is not being received
immediately by the SLI application as expected.

RESOLUTION
==========

An update to SNA Server 2.11 SP1 and 3.0 is available to correct this problem.
The updated module is SNASERVR.EXE. This fix incorporates two changes to the SNA
Server service:

- New client open requests are now queued inside the node if there is a NOTIFY
  request pending.


- Queue up outbound SSCP data messages if there is an SSCP response pending.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.0, 2.1,
2.11, and 3.0. This problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server
2.11 and 3.0 U.S. Service Packs. For information on obtaining the service pack,
