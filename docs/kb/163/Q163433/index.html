Removing Protect It!
--------------------

Although it is not recommended that you remove Protect It! (because you lose

The first step in removing Protect It! is to remove the restrictions for each
Family Member and to disable Protect It!. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Start Protect It!.

2. Click a family member in the Family Members box, click Set/Change, clear all
  of the check boxes in the "Protect It! - Limit Access to Computer (Step 1 of
  3)" dialog box, and then click Next.

3. Clear all check boxes in the "Protect It! - Limit Access to Programs (Step 2
  of 3)" dialog box, click Next, and then click Finish.

4. Verify that the following text is displayed next to the family member's
  name:

  &lt;NOT RESTRICTED&gt;

5. Repeat steps 2-4 for each family member listed in Protect It!.
