-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft SNA Server Manager starts in a minimized state in the following
scenarios:

- Manager is minimized on the Windows NT 4.0 Task Bar and cannot be restored,
  sized, or maximized.

- Manager is shown as a title bar somewhere on the desktop. It can be resized
  by dragging one of the edges of the minimized window.

- Toolbar and menu bar are missing although the SNA Subdomain is still listed
  in the title.


CAUSE
=====

SNA Server Manager can get into this minimized state if it is started after one
of more of the SNA Server services fail to start. Typically, the SNA MngAgent or
the SnaBase service are the services that failed to start when this problem
occurs.

Note: The Windows NT System Log should contain Service Control Manager errors
that indicate why the SNA Server services failed to start.

SNA Server Manager stores information about its window state in a file called
SNAEXP.SNAV. This file contains information regarding the size and position of
the main SNA Server Manager window, as well as which part of a subdomain is
displayed in each multiple document interface (MDI) window and the size and
position of the MDI windows. When SNA Server Manager is started, it reads the
information in this file and restores the window state recorded in the
SNAEXP.SNAV file.

The problem occurs because Manager gets out of sync when reading the SNAEXP.SNAV
file when the SNA Server services do not start properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following steps will resolve the issue:

1. Close SNA Server Manager if it is running.

2. Delete the SNAEXP.SNAV file in the &lt;snaroot&gt;\system directory.

3. Make sure that the SNA MngAgent service is started.

4. Start SNA Server manager.

SNA Server Manager has been updated so that is always reads the SNAEXP.SNAV file
in a normal order to prevent it from getting out of sync.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server, version
3.0. This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 3.0 U.S.
Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the
