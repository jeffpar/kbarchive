-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Microsoft StatusBar control on a top-level form does not display the size
grip--the three diagonal lines at the lower left of the status bar. Windows 95
interface standards state that top-level forms should have size grips if they
are resizable. A top-level form is resizable by definition.

When used on a form with the ShowWindow property set to other than 2 - As
Top-Level Form, the StatusBar does not display the size grip. But this is not a
Windows 95 specification for 0 - In Screen, or 1 - In Top-level Form forms.

CAUSE
=====

The StatusBar control is a member of Comctl32.dll. At the time Visual FoxPro for
Windows, version 5.0 was released, the StatusBar control did display a size grip
on a top-level form.

Several other Microsoft developer's products that have been released subsequently
replace the Comctl32.dll that was installed with Visual FoxPro 5.0.

When placed in the OLE Container Control on a Visual FoxPro 5.0 form, the
StatusBar control that is in the later version of Comctl32.dll does not exhibit
the size grip, although the form can be resized by grabbing the lower-right
corner with the mouse pointer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.
