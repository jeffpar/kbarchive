-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.


SYMPTOMS
========

When you remove Microsoft Replication Manager 3.5 from your computer, and then
reinstall it, you may receive the following message when you start Replication
Manager:

  The managed replica '&lt;Path and Filename&gt;' doesn't exist or isn't
  accessible.

This message may appear if you have installed Replication Manager from the
Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools (ODE Tools), or from a Microsoft
Access 97 run-time application that includes Replication Manager.

CAUSE
=====

When you remove Microsoft Replication Manager 3.5 from your computer, the
Windows Registry keys that store information about managed replicas remain.

RESOLUTION
==========

When you see the message described in the "Symptoms" section, you are also
prompted with the question "Would you like to remove it from the list of managed
replicas?" If the managed replica no longer exists, click Yes to remove it from
the managed replica list. If the replica is temporarily inaccessible, and you
still want to manage it with Replication Manager, click No.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Office 97 Developer
Edition Tools.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The message is the same one that you see any time you start Microsoft
Replication Manager and it cannot find a managed replica. However, when you
remove Replication Manager from your computer, you might expect information
about which replica databases it managed to be removed also.

If you install Microsoft Replication Manager 3.5 as part of ODE Tools Setup,
remove it, and then reinstall it again later, the replicas that it previously
managed may still exist. If those replicas are accessible when you start
Replication Manager, you won't even see the message; the replicas will
automatically appear in Replication Manager's managed replica list.

If you have Replication Manager on your computer as part of a run-time
application, and you remove that application, the information about the managed
replicas remains in the Windows Registry. If you later install another run-time
application that includes Replication Manager, the original managed replica
displayed in the message no longer exists on your computer.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Set up and configure Replication Manager on your computer.

2. Add at least one managed replica to Replication Manager.

3. Remove Replication Manager from your computer.

4. Move, rename, or delete the managed replica.

5. Reinstall Replication Manager, and then start it. Note that you receive the
  message as Replication Manager looks for the replicas it managed in its
  previous installation.

Tools Help Index for "Replication Manager," or refer to the Replication Manager
white paper included with Microsoft ODE Tools.
