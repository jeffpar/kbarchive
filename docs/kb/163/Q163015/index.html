The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Customers have often requested a capability for an invoking APPC transaction
program (TP) to use security option "Already Verified", even in cases where the
invoking TP was not invoked by some other APPC TP. This capability was always
available in SNA Server, but somewhat inefficient in implementation. In SNA
Server and other industry standard implementations of APPC, it is possible to
implement a "pass through" TP, which could be invoked by the real invoking TP,
and merely passes on the messages from the original invoking TP.

For a trusted APPC application, it is inefficient to issue originating (that is,
invoking) APPC conversations on behalf of multiple users using APPC "Already
Verified" security.

The direct approach would be to issue an [MC_]ALLOCATE APPC verb specifying both
security=AP_SAME and an arbitrary username in the verb control block (VCB). The
corresponding action in CPI-C would be to call cmscst(, CM_SECURITY_SAME,) and
cmscsu( , &lt;someUser&gt; . . .), or provide this information in the symbolic
destination definition. However, actually doing either of these results in an
APPC conversation that ignores the value of the username parameter.

CAUSE
=====

This limitation is behavior specified in version 1.2 of the WOSA WinAPPC and
WinCPIC specifications. It has been implemented in other APPC libraries, such as
Communications Manager 1.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

The SNA Server WinAPPC and WinCPIC APIs will support an extension as follows:

- A TP was invoked by another TP, and now initiates a conversation specifying
  security type SAME: Any username that might be be specified in the VCB is
  ignored, and the system will provide the already verified username under
  which the TP was invoked, and set the "already verified" indicator in the
  outgoing conversation request. This behavior is unchanged.

- The TP was not invoked by another TP, issues a conversation startup request
  with security type SAME, and provides a user name: The system will copy the
  specified username into the outgoing conversation request and set the
  "already verified" indicator.

- The TP was not invoked by another TP, issues a conversation startup request
  with security type SAME, but does not provide a user name: The system will
  check for environment value: AP_SAMENOSUser. If this has a value starting
  with Y, the system will provide the current logged- on user name in the
  outgoing conversation request. If the environment value is not defined, or
  has some other value, the system will provide *no* username in the outgoing
  conversation request.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 2.0, 2.10,
2.11 and 2.11 Service Pack 1 (SP1).


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.


This is a hotfix, and distribution requires manager approval. To receive the
hotfix, customers must be encountering the bug as described above. You must
track the customers you send this to and supply them with the next Service Pack
when it becomes available.
