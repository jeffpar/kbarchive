- Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

SUMMARY
=======

If you are creating a custom Setup program for your application using the
Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools (ODE) Setup Wizard, and you include
the ODBC components on the "You may now add redistributable Microsoft Office,
Microsoft Jet, and ODBC components to your custom Setup program" screen, you
must be certain that all the files needed for the added components are included
in the Setup Wizard program.

This article lists the files that are required by the ODBC Desktop Database
Drivers included in the Microsoft Office 97, Professional Edition. Some files
are included automatically. Some files are required by more than one component.
You must include these files when you run the Microsoft Office 97 Developer
Edition Tools (ODE) Setup Wizard if they are not automatically included.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For certain components that you add to the Setup Wizard program, all necessary
files are added automatically as long as Setup can find them on your computer.
For other components that you add to the Setup Wizard program, you will need to
add the files specific to those components using the "Add the files that you
want your custom Setup program to copy and then set properties for each file"
dialog box.

For example, if you plan to include the ODBC Support with SQL Server component in
your custom Setup program, the Setup Wizard will automatically include the files
needed for that component to your custom Setup program, provided the Microsoft
SQL Server driver is already installed on your computer.

Files Needed For Distributing ODBC Support with SQL Server Components
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The following files are automatically included with your custom Setup program
when you select "ODBC Support with SQL Server" if they can be found on your
computer.

  12520437.cpx     12520850.cpx
  Dbnmpntw.dll     Drvssrvr.hlp
  Ds16gt.dll       Ds32gt.dll

Files Needed for Distributing ISAM Components
---------------------------------------------

The Microsoft Access ISAM driver, Msrd2x35.dll, is automatically preselected by
the Setup Wizard. The following files are specific for each database driver, and
are included when the appropriate component is selected from the "You may now
add redistributable Microsoft Office, Microsoft Jet, and ODBC components to your
custom Setup program" screen.

  Database Driver      File Name(s)
  ---------------------------------
  dBASE                Msxbse35.dll
  Lotus 1-2-3          Msltus35.dll
