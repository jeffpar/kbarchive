SUMMARY
=======

When you upgrade to Windows NT 4.0 from an earlier version of Windows NT, all
nonessential services and devices should be disabled before beginning the
upgrade.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In order to ensure a clean, stable upgrade from Windows NT 3.x, you must disable
or remove third-party services and devices. If you do not, these devices or
services may try to start during the reboot between the character-based and
GUI-based portions of Setup. This situation may cause the computer to display a
debug screen (for example, "STOP 0x00000050" or "STOP 0x0000001E") and halt, or
to become so unstable that Setup cannot finish.

If a driver or service is not required for system operation, it should be
disabled before upgrading to Windows NT4.0.

If a driver or service is required for system operation (such as a SCSI
controller or network card), you should obtain a driver for Windows NT 4.0 from
the third-party provider and have the driver available on a floppy disk for use
during the upgrade process.

To disable a driver, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Devices.

2. Click the third-party driver you want to disable, and then click Startup.

3. In the Device dialog box, click Disabled, and then restart the computer.

4. In Control Panel, double-click Devices, and verify that the device did not
  start.

To disable a service, use the following steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Services.

2. Click the third-party service you want to disable, and then click Startup.

3. In the Service dialog box, click Disabled, and then restart the computer.

4. In Control Panel, double-click Services, and then verify that the service did
  not start.
