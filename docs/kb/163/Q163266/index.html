- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 3.0

SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain circumstances it may be appropriate to configure SNA Server as the
primary on a leased SDLC connection and have end to end LLC connectivity
established without the prior exchange of XIDs during activation.

To enable this type of connection activation, the following change must be made
to the "System Identification" parameters of the "Connection properties" for the
SDLC connection in question. One set of these parameters, which together
constitute the "Local Node Name", includes a parameter called the "Local Node
ID". The "Local Node ID" is composed of two fields, the ID Block (first field of
3 digits) and the ID Number(second field of 5 digits), to prevent sending an XID
you must delete the ID Block digits.

Note that it must be deleted (in other words, select all 3 chars and hit the DEL
key) not filled with spaces. Addtionally, it is still a required to supply an ID
number field (the second 5 characters) even though it will never be used.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

On leased SDLC links, SNA Server Service always sends a NULL XID and expects a
response to indicate to the SNA Server Service to send the Open(Station) request
to the Link Service causing the LLC mode setting command SNRM to flow to the
secondary link station.

This configuration tells the SNA Server Service that there is no XID to send on
the connection and as a result it will follow an Open(Link) Response OK with an
Open(Station) request immediately causing the Link Service to send a SNRM.
