SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word version 7.0 or 2000, there may be a delay when you save a
modified document to a network drive that is located on a Windows NT 4.0 server.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows NT client was ignoring the oplock break request from the server.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been identified as a Windows NT environment issue.

To work around this problem, you can disable an optimization called oplock
(opportunistic lock) on the remote Windows NT server or you can apply the latest
service pack.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Start the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Find the following key:

  \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
           \LanmanServer\Parameters

3. Add the following entry, if it is not already present:

    Value Name: EnableOplocks
        Data Type:  REG_DWORD
        Data:       0

  If the entry already exists, set the data to 0.

4. Exit the registry.

5. Shut down and restart Windows NT.

For additional information about oplocks, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q129202 Explanation of Opportunistic Locking on Windows NT

Disabling oplocks might cause a slight decrease in performance, but should not be
noticeable.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  " SERVPACK " (without the quotation marks)

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. A fix to
this problem is in development, but has not been regression-tested and may be
destabilizing in production environments. Microsoft does not recommend
implementing this fix at this time. Contact Microsoft Product Support Services
for more information on the availability of this fix.
