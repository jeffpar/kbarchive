SUMMARY
=======

Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.

Microsoft Visual SourceSafe integration with Microsoft Access enables you to
create a database from the SourceSafe server. This feature enables users to
create additional copies of a shared project on different workstations or
folders.

This article discusses methods for maintaining linked tables when you create a
new database from a Visual SourceSafe project.

This article assumes that you are familiar with using the client and server side
capabilities of Visual SourceSafe. For more information about Visual SourceSafe,
please refer to the "Visual SourceSafe User's Guide" or the Help topics
available from the Visual SourceSafe Help menu.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you create a new database from a project on a Visual SourceSafe server, any
linked tables in the database are refreshed as the table definitions are
created. Microsoft Access expects to find the exact configuration on the target
workstation with respect to the location of the linked tables or in the case of
linked ODBC tables, the exact DSN and configuration to connect to the ODBC data
source successfully.

If the required folder, database file, or ODBC data source is not found as the
linked table is being created, the following error occurs:

  An error occurred while trying to create the linked table '&lt;Table
  Name&gt;'

The error indicates that the table definition could not be created and will not
exist in the new database. It is important to note that the table still exists
in the SourceSafe project on the server and that the new database is not a true
reflection of the project; this situation must be corrected.

The following sections discuss techniques you can use to relink the tables in
your database.

Links to ODBC Data Sources
--------------------------

You can create a procedure that uses the RegisterDatabase method to create an
ODBC data source for a linked table. Create the code module in your database and
check it in to the Visual SourceSafe project; then when you create a new
database from that project on another workstation, the database will contain the
necessary code to refresh its linked ODBC tables.

NOTE: If ODBC is not installed on the target workstation when you create a new
database from a Visual SourceSafe project, you must install ODBC and the ODBC
drivers your database uses before you can refresh linked ODBC tables.

For an example of a procedure that programmatically creates ODBC data sources and
refreshes linked tables, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q159691 INF: Procedure to Create Data Sources and Relink ODBC Tables

Follow these steps to recreate ODBC links and resolve conflicts with the
SourceSafe project when you create a new database:

1. Create your custom procedure for creating ODBC data sources and refreshing
  your linked tables, and check it in to the Visual SourceSafe project.

2. On another workstation, start Microsoft Access and create a new database from
  the Visual SourceSafe project by pointing to SourceSafe on the Tools menu,
  and then clicking Create Database from SourceSafe Project.

3. As the database is created, you receive the following error for any linked
  ODBC tables that Microsoft Access cannot refresh:

  An error occurred while trying to create the linked table '&lt;Table
  Name&gt;'.

  Respond to all error messages and finish creating the database.

4. Execute your custom procedure to create ODBC data sources and refresh the
  linked tables.

5. Check out Data and Misc. Objects. If the object checks out successfully, your
  database is synchronized with the files on the Visual SourceSafe server. You
  can check in Data and Misc. Objects, or leave it checked out and work on the
  project.

Links That Use the Microsoft Jet Database Engine
------------------------------------------------

When you create a database from a Visual SourceSafe project that contains links
to Microsoft Access, Microsoft FoxPro, dBASE or any of the other file formats
supported by the Jet database engine, you receive one of the following error
messages if Microsoft Access cannot locate the linked table:

  Couldn't find file '&lt;File Name&gt;'.

-or-

  The Microsoft Jet database engine could not find the object '&lt;File
  Name&gt;'. Make sure the object exists and that you spell its name and the
  path name correctly.

This is followed by:

  An error occurred while trying to create the linked table '&lt;Table
  Name&gt;'.

This happens if the path to the linked table file is different on the workstation
than it is on the computer where the table links were created, or if the linked
file has been moved.

For example, the following steps cause an error when you create a new database
from a Visual SourceSafe project:

1. Create a new database with a link to a dBASE file called
  C:\MyFolder\MyFile.dbf.

2. Place the database under source code control.

3. On another workstation, create a new database from the VSS project. When
  Microsoft Access tries to create the linked dBASE table, it looks for a file
  called C:\MyFolder\MyFile.dbf. If that file does not exist on the
  workstation, an error occurs.

To avoid this problem, place the dBASE file in a shared network location before
you create the linked table. When you link to the file, use the UNC name (such
as \\MyServer\MyFolder\MyFile.dbf), or use a mapped drive letter that will be
the same on all workstations (such as G:\MyFile.dbf). Then when you place the
database under source code control and create a new database from the Visual
SourceSafe project on another workstation, Microsoft Access will find the file
and successfully create the linked table. If you use this method, and you still
receive error messages when you create a new database:

- Check that the workstation has installed the correct drivers in Microsoft
  Access to link to the table. If not, run Setup to install the necessary
  drivers.

- Verify that the workstation can access the network server via the UNC name or
  mapped drive letter (\\MyServer\MyFolder or G:), and that the correct
  permissions exist on that share to allow the workstation to read the file.

Once you resolve the connection issues to the linked file, check out Data and
Misc. Objects in the new database. If all the linked tables check out
successfully, your database is synchronized with the files on the Visual
SourceSafe server. You can check in Data and Misc. Objects, or leave it checked
out and work on the project.
