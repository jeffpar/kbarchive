Sample Visual Basic Procedure
-----------------------------

     Sub ChangeView()

        ' The smallest percentage you can use is 10%.
        Const MinViewPercent As Long = 10

        ' The largest percentage you can use is 400%.
        Const MaxViewPercent As Long = 400

        ' Stores the results of the MsgBox selection.
        Dim lResult As Long

        Dim lCurrentViewPercentage As Long
        Dim lNewViewPercentage As Long

        ' Get the current view percentage.
        lCurrentViewPercentage = ActiveWindow.View.Zoom

        ' Calculate a new view by dividing the old view by 2.
        lNewViewPercentage = (lCurrentViewPercentage / 2)

        ' Check to see if OK to change the percentage. If you apply a view
        ' percentage less then 10, a run-time error results. This code
        ' ensures a valid zoom is assigned.
        If lNewViewPercentage &gt;= MinViewPercent Then

           ' Assign the calculated percentage to the zoom percentage.
           ActiveWindow.View.Zoom = lNewViewPercentage

        Else

           ' If percentage goes out of range set to minimum level.
           ActiveWindow.View.Zoom = MinViewPercent

        End If

        ' See whether a change was made to the zoom percentage.
        If lCurrentViewPercentage = ActiveWindow.View.Zoom Then

           ' No change was made.
           MsgBox "No change was made. Your zoom percentage is already " _
           &amp; "set to the minimum percentage.", vbInformation, _
           "Minumin Already Set"

        Else

           ' A change to the zoom percentage was made.
           ' Option to restore the original zoom percentage.
           lResult = MsgBox("The zoom percentage was changed to " _
                     &amp; ActiveWindow.View.Zoom &amp; "%. " _
                     &amp; "Do you want to restore your original " _
                     &amp; "zoom percentage of " &amp; lCurrentViewPercentage _
                     &amp; "%?", vbYesNo, "Restore Original Percentage")

           ' See whether they clicked the Yes button.
           If lResult = vbYes Then
              ActiveWindow.View.Zoom = lCurrentViewPercentage
           End If
