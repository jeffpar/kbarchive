-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to look properties of the Microsoft Exchange client, either by
means of the Control Panel Mail utility or by right-clicking the Inbox on the
desktop, you may receive the following error message:

  Title : Mail
  You need more memory or system resources. Close some windows and try
  again.

Or, you may see the following symptom. When you attempt to start the Exchange
client, the splash screen appears for only a moment and the client does not
start.

CAUSE
=====

The incorrect mapi32.dll file exists in the Win95/system directory. This problem
may occur if a component is removed and again added out of the properties for
network neighborhood (control panel/network) and mapi32.dll from Win95 replaces
the Exchange mapi32.dll from the Exchange client.

When a network neighborhood component is removed and re-added on a computer that
has the Exchange client installed, the user should be prompted with the
following during the "copying files" stage:

  "A file being copied is older than the file currrently on your computer.
  It is recommended that you keep your existing file.
  File name mapi32.dll
  Description Extended MAPI 1.0 for Windows 95
  Your version 4.0.xxxxxxxxxxx
  Do you want to keep this file?

If you click No, the Windows 95 version of Mapi32.dll overwrites the newer
Mapi32.dll.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, do one of the following:

- Reinstall the Exchange client.

  -OR-

- Copy Mapi32.dll from another (working) computer running the Exchange Windows
  95 client.

  -OR-

- Expand Mapi32.dll from the Exchange client cabinet (cab) files:
  1. From a command prompt, change directory to the location of the Exchange
     Cab files (CD or netlocation)

  2. Carry out the command:

  extract /l c:\win95\system exchng5.cab mapi32.dll

NOTE: The size and date of this file will differ, depending on which version of
Exchange client is installed.
