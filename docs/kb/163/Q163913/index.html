- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Information Store (IS) or Directory (DS) services shut
down unexpectedly and log the following message in the Windows NT Server Event
Viewer Application log:

  Event ID: 49
  Source: EDB
  Type: Warning
  Category: Logging/Recovery
  Description:
  MSExchangeIS (or DS) ((286) ) The database engine is rejecting update
  operations due to low free disk space on the log disk.

  Event ID: 1113
  Source: MSExchangeIS (or DS)
  Type: Error
  Category: None
  Description:
  The log disk is full. Attempting to stop the Microsoft Exchange Information
  Store service.

One or more of the entries in the Event Log may indicate error -529 (
JET_errLogDiskFull) has occurred.

CAUSE
=====

The disk drive containing the transaction logs for the service (MDBDATA for the
IS and DSADATA for the DS) has no available space to create another log file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Using the Microsoft Exchange Performance Optimizer, move the transaction logs to
another drive containing sufficient free disk space. The new drive should have
enough free disk space for all the existing logs to be moved to that drive and
then have enough free disk space for the service to startup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following events take place when the JET database engine detects and out of
disk space condition on the log file drive:

1. The JET database engine refuses to take any more transactions from the
  Information Store service or Directory service.

2. The Information Store will rollback all uncommitted transactions (this is
  done with the use of the reserved log files RES1.LOG and RES2.LOG).

3. The Information Store shuts down gracefully, meaning all uncommitted
  transactions in the log files are flushed into the database and the databases
  are in a consistent state.

If log files are filling up your drive, you may want to find out whether they are
being purged after backups. For additional information on how to determine which
log files can safely be deleted, click the article number below to view the
