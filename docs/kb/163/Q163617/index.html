SYMPTOMS
========

If you run Equation Editor to insert an equation into a Microsoft Word document
on a multiprocessor computer, the system may stop responding (hang) for a period
of time (2 minutes or more) when you attempt to return to the container
document.

When the computer begins to respond, you may see the following error message:

  The action cannot be completed because unknown is busy. (switch to, retry,
  cancel).

Clicking Cancel causes the computer to stop responding again, and the following
error message is displayed:

  There is not enough memory to display or print the picture"

Finally, at this point, you are returned to the document.

Attempting to edit the equation again may result in the following error message:

  Word cannot edit the Microsoft Equation 2.0

This problem does not occur on single processor computers.
