SUMMARY
=======

You can return a list of bookmarks in a document sorted either alphabetically or
by placement. Omitting or including the Range object in your command will
determine that sort order. This article contains examples for both methods.

Method 1: To Return a List of Bookmarks Sorted Alphabetically
-------------------------------------------------------------

The following macro demonstrates how to return the list of bookmarks in a
document alphabetically. Note that, in this example, the Range object has been
excluded from the ActiveDocument.Bookmarks command line.

     Sub GetBookMarksByName()
        Dim bmBookMark As Bookmark
        For Each bmBookMark In ActiveDocument.Bookmarks
           MsgBox bmBookMark.Name
        Next
     End Sub

Method 2: To Return a List of Bookmarks Sorted by Placement
-----------------------------------------------------------

The following macro demonstrates how to return the list of bookmarks in a
document by order of placement. Note that, in this example, the Range object is
part of the ActiveDocument.Bookmarks command line.

     Sub GetBookMarksByPlacement()
        Dim bmBookMark As Bookmark
        For Each bmBookMark In ActiveDocument.Range.Bookmarks
           MsgBox bmBookMark.Name
        Next
     End Sub

For more information about Bookmarks, from the Visual Basic Editor, click the
Office Assistant, type "Bookmarks" (without the quotation marks), click Search,
