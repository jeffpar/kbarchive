-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When inserting an OLE object into a general field, adding an insertable OLE
object in a container control on a form, or assigning an object name to the
DocumentFile property of an OLE container control in program code, the following
error message may appear:

  OLE error code 0x80000008: Unspecified error.

CAUSE
=====

The object inserted into the general field, or added as an insertable object in
an OLE container on a form, or assigned to the DocumentFile property, has File
and Creator types that are not associated with an application on the Macintosh.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are several workarounds to this error:

- Open the file/graphic in an existing application on the Macintosh, then copy
  and paste the text/graphic into the general field.

- Use a resource editor such as Apple's ResEdit to change the File and Creator
  type to the types required by the application server.

- Use the Foxtools.cfm function FxSetType() to set the File and Creator type of
  the file to types associated with an application installed on the Macintosh.

For more information on using the FxSetType() function with an Imager File,
please see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152370 How To Use the APPEND GENERAL Command with an Imager File

  Q109482 How To Change the Creator and Type Set by FCREATE()

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

On the Macintosh, all files are associated to an application by either the File
or Creator type. A file's Creator and Type attributes identify the parent
application of a file and its specific kind. The Type attribute is used by other
applications in order to determine whether a file is a valid document to load.
Whereas in Windows, files are generally associated to applications by their file
extension.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

This error message can be produced in the following three methods.

Method 1:

Attempt to assign a file to the DocumentFile property in code when creating an
OLE object using the CREATEOBJECT() function.

NOTE: By default, the "Picts folder" and the graphics do not exist. Visual FoxPro
ships with sample graphics files that are contained in a self- extracting
archive (SEA) file located in the "Microsoft Visual FoxPro:Samples:Graphics"
folder. To follow the steps below, double-click the Picts.sea to extract the
PICT files. Store them in the default folder specified "Picts Folder." For more
information of these SEA files, read the Graphics Readme in the above folder.

     * The file and creator types used below are specific to Microsoft Imager
     * Uncomment the next three lines of code to prevent OLE error
     * mypict= HOME()+"Samples:Graphics:Picts Folder:Fox:Add.PICT"
     * SET LIBRARY TO HOME() + "Foxtools.cfm" ADDITIVE
     * =FxSetType(SYS(2027,mypict ),"PICT","MIMG")

     frmMyForm = CREATEOBJECT('form')  &amp;&amp; Create a form
     frmMyForm.Closable = .F.  &amp;&amp; Disable the close box
     frmMyForm.AddObject('cmdCommand1','cmdMyCmdBtn')  &amp;&amp; Add Command button
     frmMyForm.AddObject("oleObject","oleImager")      &amp;&amp; Add OLE object
     frmMyForm.cmdCommand1.Visible=.T.   &amp;&amp; Display the "Quit" Command button
     frmMyForm.oleObject.Visible=.T.     &amp;&amp; Display the OLE control
     frmMyForm.oleObject.Height = 50     &amp;&amp; OLE control height
     frmMyForm.oleObject.AutoActivate = 2
     frmMyForm.Show  &amp;&amp; Display the form
     frmMyForm.oleObject.DoVerb(0)       &amp;&amp; 0 for Default, -1 for Edit

     READ EVENTS  &amp;&amp; Start event processing
     CLEAR CLASS oleImager

     DEFINE CLASS oleImager as OLEControl
        OleClass ="MSImager.2"  &amp;&amp; Server name
        * Uncomment next line, comment 2nd DocumentFile to prevent error
        * DocumentFile = mypict
        DocumentFile = HOME()+"Samples:Graphics:Picts Folder:Fox:Add.PICT"
     ENDDEFINE

     DEFINE CLASS cmdMyCmdBtn AS CommandButton  &amp;&amp; Create Command button
        Caption = '\&lt;Quit'  &amp;&amp; Caption on the Command button
        Cancel = .T.  &amp;&amp; Default Cancel Command button (Esc)
        Left = 125    &amp;&amp; Command button column
        Top = 210     &amp;&amp; Command button row
        Height = 25   &amp;&amp; Command button height

        PROCEDURE Click
           CLEAR EVENTS  &amp;&amp; Stop event processing, close form
        ENDPROC
     ENDDEFINE

Method 2:

Attempt to insert an OLE object into an OLE container on a form:

1. Create a new form.

2. From the Form Controls toolbar, select the OLE Container Control button and
  click somewhere on the form.

3. In the Object Type dialog box, choose Microsoft Imager 2.0 Picture. Then
  choose the 'From File' option button under the Create label.

4. Then select Add.PICT from the following folder:

     MACINTOSH HD:VFP:Samples:Graphics:Picts Folder:Fox

Method 3:

Directly insert the OLE object into the general field of the table.

1. Create a table with a general field.

2. Browse the table and double-click on the general field to open the general
  field window.

3. Choose the Insert Object command on the Edit menu.

4. In the Object Type dialog box, choose Microsoft Imager 2.0 Picture. Then
  choose the 'From File' option button under the Create label.

5. Then select Add.PICT from the following folder:

     MACINTOSH HD:VFP:Samples:Graphics:Picts Folder:Fox

The task in Method 3 can also be accomplished by using the APPEND GENERAL
command. For more information on using the APPEND GENERAL command with OLE
objects, please see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152370 How To Use the APPEND GENERAL Command with an Imager File

  Q137295 How To Convert Memo Fields into Embedded Word Documents
