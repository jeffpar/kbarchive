SYMPTOMS
========

When you use a For Each...Next statement to loop through and remove all shapes
on a specified slide, some shapes are not deleted. For example, the following
code does not delete all the shapes on a slide.

     For Each shapeObject In ActivePresentation.Slides(1).Shapes
   
        shapeObject.Delete
   
     Next shapeObject

CAUSE
=====

When you use a For Each...Next statement in a Microsoft Visual Basic for
Applications procedure, the procedure keeps track of each shape that it finds.
When it finds the first shape, it knows that the next shape is the second shape
on the slide. However, when it finds the first shape and then deletes it, the
next shape becomes the first shape on the slide. Consequently, each subsequent
shape on the slide is assigned a new position.

Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without warranty
either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied
warranties of merchantability and/or fitness for a particular purpose. This
article assumes that you are familiar with the programming language being
demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug procedures. Microsoft
support professionals can help explain the functionality of a particular
procedure, but they will not modify these examples to provide added
functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific needs. If you have
limited programming experience, you may want to contact a Microsoft Certified
Partner or the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more

to contact Microsoft, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

As the following sample Visual Basic procedure demonstrates, you can replace the
For Each...Next statement with a Do...Loop statement (including the While
keyword) to remove all the shapes on a slide.

     Sub DeleteAllShapes()

        ' Delete every shape on slide 1.
        With ActivePresentation.Slides(1)
           While (.Shapes.Count &gt; 0)
              .Shapes(1).Delete
           Wend
        End With

     End Sub
