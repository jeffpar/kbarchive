-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Server version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS), if you place a period
(.) in a browser's command line after any script-mapped file name, you receive
unexpected results. The browser produces a document that contains the scripting
information and other data in the file.

For example, if you enter:

  http://server_name/asp_directory/file.asp.

you will receive something similar to the following:

  &lt;% emailx=request.form("email")
     remarkx=request.form("remark") Set Conn =
     Server.CreateObject("ADODB.Connection") Conn.Open "Local SQL
     Server", "sa", "DTide" Set RS = Conn.Execute("insert into
     Web_data.dbo.ASP_data(email,remark) values('" &amp; emailx &amp;
     "','" &amp; remarkx &amp; "')") %&gt;

     Your information has been added to our database.

The browser should return a confirmation Web page without the script.

CAUSE
=====

The problem affects any script-mapped files requested from a virtual directory
that has both read and execute permissions set. Adding one or more extra periods
onto the end of the URL causes the file to be displayed in the browser, instead
of run on the server. This allows end users to see information that may be
confidential, such as server-side script logic (for example, the discount
applied to the retail price from a database). This problem affects any file in
the script-map list, such as .asp, .ht., .id, .PL, and so on.

This problem only occurs on virtual directories that have both read and execute
access. If read is disabled, the server-side information is not viewable by the
end user.


RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
it has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to computers
experiencing this specific problem. If you are not severely affected by this
specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information on support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

Or use the following full URL on your client browser:

  FTP://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/

Properties cannot contain any forward slashes. Any forward slashes must be
converted to back slashes.

WORKAROUND

To work around this problem, do not place script-mapped files in a directory
that has both read and execute permissions.
