-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Setup program for your custom application, you may receive the
following error message

  Setup could not open the file:
  &lt;Path and File name&gt;

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when you run Setup from a compressed setup image that includes
a file without a 3-character file extension. The 1.44-MB Disks and Compressed
Network or CD Setup options in the Setup Wizard both create compressed setup
files.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure all file names you include with your custom application have a
3-character extension if you plan to create setup images using the 1.44-MB Disks
or Compressed Network or CD Setup options on the "Where do you want the Setup
Wizard to copy the files" screen of the Setup Wizard.

Note that if you click the Network or CD Setup option, the setup files are not
compressed, and the 3-character extensions are not required.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition Tools Help topic "Avoiding or Solving
the Most Common Problems Encountered When Using the Setup Wizard states:

  If you create disk images for your application in compressed format (you
  select 1.44-MD Disks or Compressed Network or CD Setup on the Specify
  Disk Image Options page in the Setup Wizard), you must either use full
  three-letter filename extensions (for example, MyApp.mdb) or use no
  extension (for example, Readme) for any files you specify for your
  application."

This is incorrect because file names with no extension cause an error when you
run your custom Setup program.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Use Notepad or another text editor to create a text file called Readme. The
  file can contain any text.

2. Start the Microsoft ODE Tools Setup Wizard.

3. On the opening screen of the Setup Wizard, click "Create a new set of setup
  options for my application's custom Setup program."

4. On the "Add the Files" screen of the Setup Wizard, click the Add button, and
  then add the Readme file that you created in step 1. Click to select the "Set
  as Application's Main File" check box, and then click Next.

5. On the "Add the Shortcuts" screen of the Setup Wizard, click the Add button.
  Type TestFilename in the Description box, and then click Next.

6. Click Next until you see the "Where do you want the Setup Wizard to copy the
  files" screen of the Setup Wizard. Click 1.44-MB Disks and select a folder
  where you want to store the disk images. Click Finish.

7. When prompted if you want to save the current Setup template, click No. The
  Setup Wizard creates the setup image.

8. After the Setup Wizard creates the 1.44-MB Disk images, run Setup.exe from
  the Disk1 folder on your hard drive. Note that you receive the following
  error message before Setup is finished:

  Setup could not open the file:
  &lt;Pathname&gt;\README

  Click Abort to quit Setup before it is finished.
