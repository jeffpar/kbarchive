The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows versions 2000, 2000 SP1, 2000 SP2 Advanced Server 
- Microsoft Windows versions 2000, 2000 SP1, 2000 SP2 Server

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade a Windows NT 4.0-based backup domain controller (BDC) to the
English-language version of Windows 2000 and the built-in domain accounts were
originally created in a localized version of Windows NT, after the system
upgrade process, the server restarts to start the Dcpromo.exe process. After the
server restarts, you may receive the following error message:

  The Local policy of this system does not permit you to log on interactively.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when a Group Policy object (GPO) is configured with the
"Log on Locally" policy at the domain, site, or organizational unit level. The
policy has defined the Domain Users group or groups with only domain users.
Those accounts and groups were created in the localized version, and the account
that the system that is being upgraded tries to use for logon in the background
is the "administrator" account, in English, and this is not recognized by the
policy.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, use either of the following methods.

Method 1
--------

Manually add "Administrators" in English, to the default domain controllers
"logon locally" policy. Note that it is not possible to browse this group
because it does not exist in English.

Method 2
--------

In the policy that is defined at the domain, site, or organizational unit level,
add the Everyone group to the list of users and groups that are defined in the
"Log on Locally" policy, or change the "Log on Locally" policy to "Not
configured".

MORE INFORMATION
================

The behavior that is described in this article can occur with localized versions
of Windows NT such as French, Portuguese, Spanish, and other
non-English-language versions of Windows NT.
