- SUMMARY

   - Obtain a Certificate

   - Generating the CSR

- Request the Certificate
- Install the Certificate
- Enforce SSL Connections

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the following:

- How to set up and enable server certificates so that your customers can be
  certain that your Web site is valid, and that any information that they send
  to you stays private and confidential.

- How to use third-party certificates to enable Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), as
  well as a general overview of the process that is used to generate a
  Certificate Signing Request (CSR), which is used to obtain a third-party
  certificate.

- How to enable SSL connectivity for your Web site.

- How to enforce SSL for all connections, and set the required encryption
  length between your clients and your Web site.

You can use your Web server's SSL security features for two types of
authentication. You can use a server certificate to allow users to authenticate
your Web site before they transmit personal information, such as a credit card
number. Also, you can use client certificates to authenticate users that request
information on your Web site.

This article assumes that you will use a third-party certificate authority (CA)
to provide authentication for your Web server.

To enable SSL server certificate verification, and to provide the level of
security that your customers desire, you should obtain a certificate from a
third-party CA. Certificates that are issued to your organization by a
third-party CA are typically tied to the Web server, and more specifically to
the Web site to which you to bind SSL. You can create your own certificate with
the Internet Information Services (IIS) server, but if you do so, your clients
must implicitly trust you as the certificate authority.

This article assumes the following:

- You have installed IIS.

- You have created and published the Web site that you wish to secure with SSL.

Obtain a Certificate
--------------------

To begin the process to obtain the certificate, you must generate a CSR. You do
this through the IIS management console; therefore, IIS must be installed before
you can generate a CSR. A CSR is basically a certificate that you generate on
your server that validates the computer-specific information about your server
when you request a certificate from a third-party CA. The CSR is simply an
encrypted text message that is encrypted with a public/private key pair.

Typically, the following information about your computer is included in the CSR
that you generate:

- Organization

- Organizational unit

- Country

- State

- Locality

- Common name

NOTE: The common name is usually comprised of your host computer name and the
domain to which it belongs, such as xyz.com. In this case, the computer is part
of the .com domain, and is named XYZ. This may be the root server for your
corporate domain, or simply a Web site.

Generating the CSR:

1. Access the IIS Microsoft Management Console (MMC). To do this, right-click My
  Computer and click Manage. This opens the Computer Management Console. Expand
  the Services and Application section. Locate Internet Information Services
  and expand the IIS console.

2. Select the specific Web site on which you want to install a server
  certificate. Right-click the site and click Properties.

3. Click the Directory Security tab. In the Secure Communications section, click
  Server Certificate. This starts the Web Server Certificate Wizard. Click
  Next.

4. Select Create a New Certificate and click Next.

5. Select Prepare the request now, but send it later and click Next.

6. In the Name field, enter a name that you can remember. It will default to the
  name of the Web site for which you are generating the CSR.

NOTE: When you generate the CSR, you need to specify a bit length. The bit length
of the encryption key determines the strength of the encrypted certificate which
you send to the third-party CA. The higher the bit length, the stronger the
encryption. Most third-party CAs prefer a minimum of 1024 bits.

7. In the Organization Information section, enter your organization and
  organizational unit information. This must be accurate, because you are
  presenting these credentials to a third-party CA and you must comply with
  their licensing of the certificate. Click Next to access the Your Site's
  Common Name section.

8. The Your Site's Common Name section is responsible for binding the
  certificate to your Web site. For SSL certificates, enter the host computer
  name with the domain name. For Intranet servers, you may use the NetBIOS name
  of the computer that is hosting the site. Click Next to access geographical
  information.

9. Enter your country, state or province, and country or region information.
  Completely spell out your state or province and country or region; do not use
  abbreviations. Click Next.

10. Save the file as a .txt file. When you actually send the request to the CA,
  you must paste the contents of this file into the request. This file will be
  encrypted and contain a header and footer for the contents. You must include
  both the header and footer when you request the certificate.

A CSR should resemble the following:

-----END NEW CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----

11. Confirm your request details. Click Next to finish, and exit the Web Server
  Certificate Wizard.

Request the Certificate
-----------------------

There are different methods of submitting your request. Contact the certificate
provider of your choice to request and receive your certificate and to determine
the best certificate level for your needs.

Install the Certificate
-----------------------

Once the third-party CA has completed your request for a server certificate, you
will receive it by e-mail or download site. The certificate must be installed on
the Web site on which you want to provide secure communications.

To install the certificate, follow these steps:

1. The key can only be decrypted with the private key that you generated
  earlier. Copy the text of the certificate key (it should appear to be very
  similar to the key you generated earlier) and paste it into a .txt document.
  Be sure to include the header and footers of the certificate. Save the file
  as Cert.txt.

2. Open the IIS MMC as described in the "Generating the CSR" section.

3. Access the Properties dialog box for the Web site on which you are installing
  the certificate.

4. Click the Directory Security tab and click Server Certificate. This starts
  the Web Server Certificate Wizard. Click Next.

5. Select Process the Pending Request and install the certificate and click
  Next.

6. Browse to the text file that you saved in step 1. Click Next twice, then
  click Finish.

Enforce SSL Connections
-----------------------

Now that the server certificate is installed, you can enforce SSL secure channel
communications with clients of the Web server. First, you need to enable port
443 for secure communications with the Web site. To do this, follow these
steps:

1. From the Computer Management console, right-click the Web site on which you
  want to enforce SSL and click Properties.

2. Click the Web Site tab. In the Web Site Identification section, verify that
  the SSL Port field is populated with the numeric value 443.

3. Click Advanced. You should see two fields. The IP address and port of the Web
  site should already be listed in the Multiple identities for this web site
  field. Under the Multiple SSL Identities for this web site field, click Add
  if port 443 is not already listed. Select the server's IP address, and type
  the numeric value 443 in the SSL Port field. Click OK.

Now that port 443 is enabled, you can enforce SSL connections. To do this, follow
these steps:

1. Click the Directory Security tab. In the Secure Communications section, note
  that Edit is now available. Click Edit.

2. Select Require Secure Channel (SSL).

NOTE: If you specify 128-bit encryption, clients who use 40-bit or 56-bit
strength browser will not be able to communicate with your site unless they
upgrade their encryption strength.
3. Open your browser and try to connect to your Web server by using the standard
  http:// protocol. If SSL is being enforced, you receive the following error
  message:

  The page must be viewed over a secure channel
  The page you are trying to view requires the use of "https" in the address.

  Please try the following: Try again by typing https:// at the beginning of the
  address you are attempting to reach. HTTP 403.4 - Forbidden: SSL required
  Internet Information Services
  Technical Information (for support personnel) Background: This error indicates
  that the page you are trying to access is secured with Secure Sockets Layer
  (SSL).

You can now connect to your Web site only by using the https:// protocol.
