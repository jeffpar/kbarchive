SUMMARY
=======

This article demonstrates how to bypass the printer driver and send a PCL or
PostScript file directly to a printer from Visual Basic.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
  default.

2. Place two Command Buttons, Command1 and Command2, onto Form1.

3. Add the following code to the code window of Form1:

  Option Explicit
    
  ' Modify FILE_NAME to point to a valid path and file name on your system.
  Const FILE_NAME = "C:\TEST.PRN"  

  Private Type DOCINFO
    pDocName As String
    pOutputFile As String
    pDatatype As String
  End Type

  Private Declare Function ClosePrinter Lib "winspool.drv" (ByVal _
    hPrinter As Long) As Long
    
  Private Declare Function EndDocPrinter Lib "winspool.drv" (ByVal _
    hPrinter As Long) As Long
    
  Private Declare Function EndPagePrinter Lib "winspool.drv" (ByVal _
    hPrinter As Long) As Long
    
  Private Declare Function OpenPrinter Lib "winspool.drv" Alias _
    "OpenPrinterA" (ByVal pPrinterName As String, phPrinter As Long, _
    ByVal pDefault As Long) As Long
    
  Private Declare Function StartDocPrinter Lib "winspool.drv" Alias _
    "StartDocPrinterA" (ByVal hPrinter As Long, ByVal Level As Long, _
    pDocInfo As DOCINFO) As Long
    
  Private Declare Function StartPagePrinter Lib "winspool.drv" (ByVal _
    hPrinter As Long) As Long
    
  Private Declare Function WritePrinter Lib "winspool.drv" (ByVal _
    hPrinter As Long, pBuf As Any, ByVal cdBuf As Long, _
    pcWritten As Long) As Long

  Private Sub Command1_Click()
    Dim lhPrinter As Long
    Dim lReturn As Long
    Dim lpcWritten As Long
    Dim lDoc As Long
    Dim sWrittenData As String
    Dim MyDocInfo As DOCINFO
    lReturn = OpenPrinter(Printer.DeviceName, lhPrinter, 0)
    If lReturn = 0 Then
        MsgBox "The Printer " &amp; Printer.DeviceName &amp; " could not be opened!"
        Exit Sub
    End If
    MyDocInfo.pDocName = "My Document"
    MyDocInfo.pOutputFile = vbNullString
    MyDocInfo.pDatatype = vbNullString
    lDoc = StartDocPrinter(lhPrinter, 1, MyDocInfo)
    Call StartPagePrinter(lhPrinter)
    sWrittenData = "How's that for Magic !!!!" &amp; vbFormFeed
    lReturn = WritePrinter(lhPrinter, ByVal sWrittenData, _
       Len(sWrittenData), lpcWritten)
    lReturn = EndPagePrinter(lhPrinter)
    lReturn = EndDocPrinter(lhPrinter)
    lReturn = ClosePrinter(lhPrinter)
  End Sub

  Private Sub Command2_Click()
    Dim lhPrinter As Long
    Dim lReturn As Long
    Dim lpcWritten As Long
    Dim lDoc As Long
    Dim sWrittenData As String
    Dim MyDocInfo As DOCINFO
    
    Dim NumLoops As Long     ' number of 8k loops
    Dim LeftOver As Integer  ' amount of file left
    Dim i As Integer         ' counter for loops
    Const MaxSize = 8192     ' maximum buffer size
    
    lReturn = OpenPrinter(Printer.DeviceName, lhPrinter, 0)
    If lReturn = 0 Then
        MsgBox "The Printer Name you typed wasn't recognized."
        Exit Sub
    End If
    MyDocInfo.pDocName = "My Document"
    MyDocInfo.pOutputFile = vbNullString
    MyDocInfo.pDatatype = vbNullString
    lDoc = StartDocPrinter(lhPrinter, 1, MyDocInfo)
    ' Make sure that FILE_NAME points to a valid PCL or PostScript file on your system.
    Open FILE_NAME For Binary As #1
    
    ' Calculate size of file and amount left over.
    NumLoops = LOF(1) \ MaxSize
    LeftOver = LOF(1) Mod MaxSize
    
    For i = 1 To NumLoops
      sWrittenData = Input(MaxSize, #1)
      lReturn = WritePrinter(lhPrinter, ByVal sWrittenData, _
                    Len(sWrittenData), lpcWritten)
    Next
    
    ' Grab what is left over.
    If LeftOver &lt;&gt; 0 Then
      sWrittenData = Input(LeftOver, #1)
      lReturn = WritePrinter(lhPrinter, ByVal sWrittenData, _
                        Len(sWrittenData), lpcWritten)
    End If
    
    Close #1
    lReturn = EndDocPrinter(lhPrinter)
    lReturn = ClosePrinter(lhPrinter)
  End Sub

  Private Sub Form_Load()
    Command1.Caption = "Print a String"
    Command2.Caption = "Print a File"
  End Sub

4. Assign the constant FILE_NAME in the code with your own PCL or PostScript
  path and file name.

5. Run the project. Click Print a String, which prints a string to the printer.
  Click Print a File to read and print a PCL or PostScript file directly to the
  printer.
