-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to view a Systems Management Server (SMS) client's subnet masks (IP
Subnet) in Resource Explorer, you may see its IP addresses instead of the subnet
masks. The IP addresses appear both in the IP Address and the IP Subnet columns
in Resource Explorer under Hardware\Network Adapter Configuration.

This is most commonly seen with subnet masks, but can also occur with other
properties in Resource Explorer, especially if you have enabled additional
classes and properties to be inventoried through the MOFMAN tool or by directly
modifying the Sms_def.mof file. The general symptom is that the data that is
displayed for one property actually belongs to a different property.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you inventory both IP addresses and subnets masks and
the client has a large number of IP addresses that are bound to one network
adapter. The SMS Hardware Inventory Agent can only report strings of up to 256
bytes in length, and this problem appears when you get close to (or exceed) this
limit, normally around 20 IP addresses. Most likely, you may see the following
two entries in the Hinv32.log file during a hardware scan if you experience this
problem:

  WARNING - Unable to return all values of property IPAddress of
  Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration, max length reached !!

  WARNING - Unable to return all values of property IPSubnet of
  Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration, max length reached !!

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q288239 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, reduce the number of IP addresses that are bound to
the network adapter.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4.
