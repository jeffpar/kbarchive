SUMMARY
=======

MSN Explorer (MSN Version 6.1) Sign-in And Sign-up Error Messages:

MORE INFORMATION
================

Error Message: A password must be at least 8 characters long, please choose a longer password.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This error occurs when a user tries to set up a password that is less than the 8
character minimum. Inform the user that MSN passwords must be at least 8
characters in length. Enter a valid password in both fields, and then click
Continue.

Error Message: Invalid Password.  Please try again.
---------------------------------------------------

This error occurs when the user has entered an incorrect password for an existing
account.

To resolve this issue

- Re-type the password.

If the user cannot recall the correct password, ask the user to contact Customer
Service to have the password reset.

Error Message: Passwords can only contain letters (a-z) and numbers (0-9), and no spaces.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This error occurs when the user tries to use a password with invalid characters.
Only the characters referenced in the error message may be used in a password.
Enter a valid password, and then click Continue.

Error Message: Please choose a secret question.
-----------------------------------------------

This error occurs when the user has not selected a secret question for their
password. The purpose of the secret question is to allow a user to reset a
password if the password is forgotten. Choose a secret question from the list,
type an answer to the question in the box below, and click Continue.

Error Message: Please enter a password.
---------------------------------------

This error occurs when the user leaves the Password box blank. Enter a password
and click Continue.

Error Message: Please enter a secret answer.
--------------------------------------------

This error occurs when the user chooses a secret question, but does not provide
an answer for the question. The purpose of the secret question is to allow the
user to reset a password if the password is forgotten. The user must provide an
answer to the question at this stage in case the password is forgotten. Type an
answer to the secret question in the box, and then click Continue.

Error Message: Please enter your password.
------------------------------------------

This error occurs when the user has left the password field blank. Enter the
password, and then click Continue.

Error Message: Please enter your password again to make sure it is correct.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This error occurs when the user has typed in a password, but has not typed the
password in the re-type your password field. MSN Explorer requires users to type
the password for the account twice. This ensures that the user is typing the
correct information, because the user cannot see the characters that they are
typing (only *'s are visible). If the two passwords don't match, then you must
type them again. Enter the password in both boxes, and then click Continue.

Error Message: The passwords you entered do not match, please try again.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This error occurs when a user types a password in both fields, but the two
passwords do not match. This ensures that the user is typing the correct
information, because the user cannot see the characters that they are typing
(only *'s are visible). If the two passwords don't match, then you must type
them again. Enter the password in both boxes, and then click Continue.

Error Message: The password you have chosen is too similar to your e-mail name.  Please choose another e-mail name or a different password.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This error occurs when the user tries to use a password that is identical or very
close to the e-mail name. For security purposes MSN Explorer does not allow
this; it makes it easier for another person to guess a password. Change either
the password or the e-mail name, and then click Continue.

Error Message: Your password cannot contain your first name, please try again.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This error occurs when the user types in a password that contains the user's
actual first name. For security purposes, passwords cannot contain actual first
names. Enter a valid password, and then click Continue.

Error Message: Your password cannot contain your last name, please try again.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This error occurs when the user types in a password that contains the last name.
For security purposes, passwords cannot contain last names. Enter a valid
password, and then click Continue.

Error Message: Your password cannot start with a number.
--------------------------------------------------------

This error occurs when the user types in a password that begins with a number.
Passwords must begin with letters. A password can contain numbers, but cannot
begin with one. Enter a valid password, and then click Continue.

Error Message: Your secret answer cannot contain your password. Please try again.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This error occurs when the user answers the secret questions with a phrase
containing the password or part of the secret question (for example, if the
secret question is the mother's maiden name and the answer provided is mother).
This is not allowed for security purposes, because this would allow another
person to easily reset the password. Type a different answer--or choose a
different secret question and answer--and then click Continue.
