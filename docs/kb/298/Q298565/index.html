  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to manually start the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector
(IMC) on a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 computer, you may receive the following
error message:

  Services
  Could not start the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector service on
  \\&lt;computername&gt;.
  Error 2140: An internal Windows NT error occurred.

In addition, the following event ID message may be logged in the Application
event log:

  Event ID: 4086
  Source: MSExchangeIMC
  Type: Error
  Category: Initialization/Termination
  Description: Unable to start the service because the configuration could not
  be loaded from the Microsoft Exchange directory or Windows NT Registry.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the value of the following registry key does not match
the corresponding directory entry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\
  System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters\SiteDN

This issue can also occur if the wrong Organization or Site name was used when
Exchange Server was reinstalled on the computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this issue, edit the value of the registry key so that it matches the
corresponding directory entry, or reinstall Exchange Server using the correct
Organization and Site names.

To edit the registry:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the SiteDN value under the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\
  System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters\SiteDN

3. Check the value for this key. Make sure that the Organization [o=], Site
  [ou=], and Server directory names [cn=] exactly match the properties of the
  Organization, Site, and Server objects as they are displayed in the Exchange
  Server Administrator program. To determine the names of these objects, follow
  these steps:

  a. Start the Administrator program.

  b. In the left pane, click to expand the Organization object, click to expand
     the Site object, and then click to expand the Server object.

  c. On the File menu, click Properties. The directory name of each of these
     objects must exactly match the corresponding attributes in the registry
     setting that is described in step three.

4. Quit Registry Editor.
