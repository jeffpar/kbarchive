-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to load Service Pack 3 (SP3), and you then stop the
installation after you receive numerous ".dll in use" error messages, Exchange
Server services may not start. When you try to start Microsoft Exchange
Directory service, you may receive the following error message:

  Dsamain.exe -Entry Point Not Found
  The procedure entry point ?HrRegisterProtocol@@YGJPAVPROTO@@FJJJKHPAXK@Z could
  not be located in the dynamic link library Netif.dll.

CAUSE
=====

The issue can occur because the Netif.dll file was not updated due to the
cancellation of the SP3 installation.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Stop all nonessential services.

2. Repeat the SP3 installation. Each time that you receive the following error
  message during the installation, write down the .dll file names that appear:

  Could not open the file named &lt;drive
  letter&gt;:\Winnt\System32\&lt;filename&gt;.dll. It is in use by another
  application.

3. When you complete the SP3 installation, rename all of the .dll files whose
  names you wrote down.

4. Search for the renamed files and replace each of them with the appropriate
  .dll file that is on the SP3 compact disc.
