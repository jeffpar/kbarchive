-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are printing with SNA Server 3.0 (or later) or Host Integration Server
2000 on a Windows NT 4.0 Server (with Service Pack [SP] 4 or later), all SNA
Server/Host Integration Server print jobs may stop printing and eventually the
server will "hang" (lock). When this occurs, all keyboard and mouse activity
will cease.

This problem does not occur when running on Windows 2000 Server.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by a memory leak when you are using the generic text
print driver. For additional information, click the article number below to view
the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q244350 Memory Leaks in 'Drsd' Tag When Printing to Generic Text Printer

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, apply the updated RASDD.dll file available from the
link provided in the "Cause" section of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following information would be recorded if Performance Monitor were running
during this time.

In one documented case of the problem, the following objects, counters, and
instances were used:

  Object = Process and Memory
  Counter = Private Bytes and Pool Paged Bytes
  Instance = SNASERVR, SNABASE and SNAPRINT

During this time you would see the process/private bytes for SNASERVR and SNABASE
increase, level off, and then start to decrease, while SNAPRINT would remain in
a steady state. However, when viewing the memory object on the pool paged bytes
counter, you would observe a steady increase of paged bytes up until the point
at which the server stops responding.

Reviewing the event viewer logs leading up to this failure would show the
following errors:

  SYSTEM LOG

  Event 2020 - Source: Srv

  The server was unable to allocate from the system paged pool because the pool
  was empty.

In addition to that event, a Snadump.log and Dr. Watson log (if configured as the
default debugger) may be generated during this time as well:

  APPLICATION LOG

  Event 624 - Source: SNA Server (snadump)
  Event 4097 - Source: DrWatson
