-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click the Change button to change your display adapter driver, you
receive the following error message:

  The drivers were not successfully installed. You may not have the required
  privilege to install a new driver

You may receive this error message even if are logged on as a Local Administrator
and you have verified that the Local Administrators group has User Right of Load
and Unload Device Drivers.

CAUSE
=====

The Display.inf file may be missing or corrupted. The Display.inf file is
usually located in the %windir%\inf folder.

If the %windir%\inf file contains a third-party .inf file, you do not receive the
error message described in the "Symptoms" section of this article, but only the
third-party video drivers will be listed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Extract the Display.in_ file from the I386 folder on the Windows NT 4.0 CD.

  The Display.in_ file is the compressed version of the Display.inf file.

2. Copy the Display.inf file from the I386 folder on the Windows NT 4.0 Setup CD
  to the %windir%\inf folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a third-party video driver is installed, it is possible that only the
third-party video adapters will be displayed when you click Change, and you do
not receive the error message described in the "Symptoms" section of this
article. This also indicates the Display.inf file may be corrupted or missing.
If third-party drivers do not appear, make sure the 3rdparty.inf file for the
display adapter is present in the C:\%windir%\inf directory. Both 3rdparty.inf
and Display.inf are listed when you click Change. Some third-party video drivers
are included with the retail Windows NT 4.0 CD, in addition to those listed in
the Display.inf file. These drivers are listed in the Dispoem.inf file.

NOTE: You receive the error message only if both the Display.inf and the
Dispoem.inf file are either corrupted or missing from the %windir%\inf folder.
