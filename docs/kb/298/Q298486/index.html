-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3, 5.5 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If a message that contains more than 1,024 attachments is submitted to the
Exchange.box on a Lotus Notes server, the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus
Notes service (Lsntsmex.exe) may stop. Messages may sit in the queue and may not
be delivered. The Exchange Notes Connector does not mark the message that
contains more than 1,024 attachments as a problem message, but no new mail is
processed until you remove the message and you restart the service.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because the Exchange Server information store cannot
process more than 1,024 attachments for each message; therefore, when the
connector tries to create the 1,024th (0x400th) attachment, the information
store stops responding. The connector calls fail, and the Lsntsmex.exe process
stops, which causes subsequent messages from Notes to Exchange Server to be
backlogged.


RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.
