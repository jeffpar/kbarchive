SYMPTOMS
========

If you have used the (now discontinued) DellNet Internet service, you may have
received a notice inviting you to migrate to DellNet by MSN Internet Access.
When you installed the DellNet by MSN software, instead of creating a new MSN
Internet Access account, you may have selected your old DellNet dial-up
connection as the connection device. For this reason, you can no longer access
the Internet.

CAUSE
=====

The old DellNet connection was selected mistakenly when the DellNet by MSN
software was set up.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can create a new MSN Internet Access account through the DellNet by MSN
software.
To create a new MSN Internet Access account

1. Contact Customer Service at 1-800-386-5550 to have a new MSN Internet Access
  account created.

2. Follow the instructions in KB Article Q294853 to set up a manual dial-up
  connection in the DellNet by MSN software.

3. Start DellNet by MSN.

4. In the upper-right corner, click Connection Settings.

5. Click Change how to connect to the Internet, and then click Continue.

6. Click Existing Internet Service Provider, and then click Continue.

7. Sign in to DellNet by MSN.

8. Click Help And Settings, click My Account, and then click Delete User.

9. Click the user tile you signed in with, and then click OK.
  A warning box will appear.

10. Click OK.

11. If there are other user tiles on the machine, repeat steps three through 10
  to delete other tiles from the machine.

12. Exit DellNet by MSN.

13. Start DellNet by MSN.
  This will allow you to go through setup again.

14. Click No, I already have Internet access, and then click Continue.

15. Click Yes, and then click Continue.

16. Follow the directions for setting up the MSNIA account in MSN Explorer 6.1.

17. After the software has been configured, double-click the My Computer icon on
  the desktop.

18. Double-click the Dial-up Networking icon.
  Note: With Windows 2000 and ME, click the Dial-up Networking link.

19. Right-click the manual connection you created earlier, and then click
  Delete.

20. Close the Dial-up Networking window.
