The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3, 5.5 SP4 
- Microsoft Exchange 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Exchange Server message transfer agent (MTA) may generate a delivery report
(DR) or non-delivery report (NDR) with a content type that is set to an external
value (2A 86 48 86 F7 14 05 01), which is MDBEF. This can cause problems for
non-Exchange Server MTAs that do not recognize the value.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if an MTA does not set the Return-of-Content-Requested
bit on the original message. Exchange Server receives the message over the X.400
Connector, converts the P22 content to MDBEF, and delivers the content (or does
not deliver it). The Exchange Server MTA then generates the report and does not
add the content, but does set the content type to MDBEF. This problem does not
normally occur between Exchange Server MTAs because Exchange Server MTAs always
set the Return-of-Content-Requested bit on messages.

RESOLUTION
==========

Exchange 2000 Server

2000 Server. For additional information, please see the following article in the
