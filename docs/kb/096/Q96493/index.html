-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following information was taken from the MS-DOS 6 Upgrade README.TXT file.

2. MEMMAKER AND MEMORY MANAGEMENT
=================================

2.1 Intel Expanded-Memory Driver (EMM.SYS)
------------------------------------------
If you use Intel's EMM.SYS driver with Aboveboard, use EMM.SYS
version 4.0 revision E if you an ISA system, or EMM.SYS version 4.0
revision D if you have an MCA or other system. Contact Intel for a
free upgrade.

2.2 Running MemMaker on a Computer with PC-NFS
----------------------------------------------
If you use PC-NFS network software, carry out the following procedure
before you run MemMaker:

1. Open your MEMMAKER.INF file by using any text editor. This file is
  in the directory that contains your MS-DOS files.

2. Add the following line to the file:

  *NET

3. Save the file, and then run MemMaker.

2.3 You have a Super VGA display and want to conserve memory.
-------------------------------------------------------------
If you have an 80386 computer with extended memory and a Super
VGA display, you can use the MONOUMB.368 file, in conjunction
with MemMaker, to conserve conventional memory for running programs.

To conserve memory if you have a Super VGA display:

1. Open your Windows SYSTEM.INI file, and find the [386Enh] section.

2. Add a DEVICE command for the MONOUMB.386 file, which is located
  in your MS-DOS directory. For example, if your MS-DOS files are in
  C:\DOS, add the following line to this section:

  DEVICE=C:\DOS\MONOUMB.386

3. Save the file, and restart your computer.

4. After your computer starts, run MemMaker by typing MEMMAKER at the
  command prompt.

5. Choose Custom Setup. On the Advanced Options screen, answer Yes to
  the question "Use monochrome region (B000-B7FF) for running
  programs?"

  Follow the instructions on your screen.

2.4 Using MemMaker with IBM LAN
-------------------------------
Before you run MemMaker, you might need to make adjustments to the
parameters specified for your IBM LAN support driver, DXMC0MOD.SYS. In
your CONFIG.SYS file, make sure that the DEVICE command that loads
DXMC0MOD.SYS includes one of the following before you run MemMaker:

o The first three parameters, as in the following example:

 DEVICE=C:\DXMC0MOD.SYS 400000000001,D800,1

o No parameters, as in the following example:

 DEVICE=C:\DXMC0MOD.SYS

o Some parameters and enough commas to fill in the first three
 parameters, as in the following example:

 DEVICE=C:\DXMC0MOD.SYS 400000000001,,

2.5 MemMaker and Adaptec SCSI devices
-------------------------------------
MemMaker is compatible with Adaptec SCSI devices. However, if you use
the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver to support your SCSI device, MemMaker by
default will exclude this driver from the optimization process. If you
don't use the SCSI device as your startup or boot drive, you can
include the ASPI4DOS.SYS driver in the optimization process. To do so,
remove the *ASPI4DOS entry in the MEMMAKER.INF file, and then run
MemMaker.

3. WINDOWS
==========&lt;7F&gt;

3.1 The "Cannot run Windows in standard mode" message appears.
--------------------------------------------------------------
If you have a DEVICE=EMM386.EXE command in your CONFIG.SYS file
that includes the RAM or NOEMS switch, you cannot run
Windows 3.0 in standard mode. Either remove the RAM or NOEMS
switch and add the AUTO or OFF switch, or run Windows in real or
enhanced mode.

NOTE  Using EMM386 may reduce the amount of extended memory
available to Windows and cause Windows to start in
standard mode. To prevent this, reduce the amount of
extended memory that other device drivers use. For example,
if you are using SMARTDrive, try setting the MinCacheSize
parameter to 0.

3.2 Your computer uses a Windows 3.0 permanent swap file.
---------------------------------------------------------
If your computer uses a Windows 3.0 permanent swap file, run
the SPATCH.BAT program to make the swap file compatible with MS-DOS 6.
To do so, carry out the following procedure:

1. Copy the SPATCH.BAT file to your hard disk. To determine the
  location of the file on the Setup disks, view the PACKING.LST file
  on Setup Disk 1.

2. Type the following at the command prompt:

  SPATCH [DRIVE]:[PATH]SWAPFILE.EXE

  For the DRIVE and PATH parameters, specify the location of
  your SWAPFILE.EXE file.

3. Follow the instructions on your screen.

  The program modifies the SWAPFILE.EXE for use with MS-DOS 6
  and saves a backup copy as SWAPFILE.SAV. After you have confirmed
  the file works correctly, you can delete the SWAPFILE.SAV file.

4. HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY WITH MS-DOS
=====================================

4.1 Compaq EXTDISK.SYS Driver
-----------------------------
The Compaq EXTDISK.SYS driver version 3.00 or later is
compatible with MS-DOS 6. If you have a version earlier
than 3.00, contact your vendor for an upgrade.

4.2 Hardcard
------------
To use DoubleSpace on a system that uses its Hardcard drive as its
startup drive, see section 7.9. For additional Hardcard
information, see the following:

a) Hardcard II

  If you can't use Plus Development Hardcard II or Hardcard
  II XL when running EMM386.EXE, specify the exclude (x=)
  switch to prevent EMM386 from conflicting with the card's
  BIOS address.

  To configure EMM386, run MemMaker.

b) Hardcard 40 or Passport

  If you are using Hardcard 40 or a Passport removable
  disk, and you have a DEVICE command in your CONFIG.SYS file
  for PLUSDRV.SYS, disable or remove the DEVICE command.
  Then run MS-DOS 6 Setup. After Setup is complete, reenable or
  restore the DEVICE command for PLUSDRV.SYS. Make it the last line
  in the file.

c) If you are unable to access your compressed drive after installing
  DoubleSpace on your Hardcard, try the following:

  1) Add a DBLSPACE /MOUNT command to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to mount
     the compressed volume file on the Hardcard every time you start
     your computer.

  2) Or, ensure that there is at least one device driver (for
     example, ANSI.SYS) loaded in your CONFIG.SYS file AFTER the
     ATDOSXL.SYS driver but BEFORE the DBLSPACE.SYS driver.

4.3 Inboard 386/PC
-------------------
The Inboard 386/PC is incompatible with MemMaker and the EMM386
memory manager that comes with MS-DOS 6.

4.4 Olivetti and AT&amp;T Systems with CGA Video Boards
---------------------------------------------------
An Olivetti or AT&amp;T system with a CGA video board might not scroll
correctly. Add the /S switch to the DEVICE=ANSI.SYS command
in your CONFIG.SYS file.

4.5 Toshiba
-------------------
If you used the MS-DOS 5.0 version of EMM386 before you ran
Setup, and you use the Power Management function, use
the VRESUME program or device driver to avoid problems with
the Resume feature. Carry out the following procedure:

1. Make sure the VRESUME.COM or VRESUME.SYS file is on your hard disk.
  To load the TSR, add a command for VRESUME.COM to your AUTOEXEC.BAT
  file. To load the device driver, add a command for the VRESUME.SYS
  file to your CONFIG.SYS file.

2. Save the file, and restart your computer.

  NOTE  For information about using VRESUME with Windows 3.0, see the
  WRESUME.TXT file on your Toshiba MS-DOS 5.0 disks.

5. MICROSOFT PROGRAMS
=====================

5.1 Microsoft Anti-Virus
------------------------
Before cleaning a program file, make sure you have a backup copy of
it. If you clean a program file, and the program is corrupted,
reinstall the program. If Anti-Virus again detects a virus, there is a
chance the detection is in error; contact your software vendor to
determine if an updated version of the program is available.

5.2 Microsoft Backup
--------------------
The topics contained in this section are "Running Microsoft Backup
for MS-DOS under Windows," "Backup for Windows stops running at the
end of the compatibility test," and "Running Microsoft with TI4000 and
Gateway NOMAD computers."

Running Microsoft Backup for MS-DOS under Windows
-------------------------------------------------
You should not run Backup for MS-DOS while Windows is running.
However, if you do, and if your system is not configured correctly,
Backup might display the following symptoms:

o Backup appears to stop running--for example, the clock runs, but
 there is no disk activity.

o Backup reports problems while testing the second floppy disk during
 the compatibility test. For example, it might display a "Diskette
 not properly seated" message or ask for Disk 1 repeatedly.

o Windows displays a message that the DMA buffer size needs to be
 increased.

o Backup quits unexpectedly.

You can correctly configure your system by carrying out the following
procedure.

1. Open your SYSTEM.INI file, and add a DMABufferSize=32 line to the
  [386Enh] section.

2. When you run Backup, make sure that you specify with the Settings
  command from the Control menu that Backup run with the Exclusive
  and Full Screen options.

Backup for Windows stops running at the end of the compatibility test
---------------------------------------------------------------------
If Backup for Windows stops running at the end of the
Compatibility Test, you might be loading an incompatible third-party
backup driver in your SYSTEM.INI file. Carry out the following
procedure.

NOTE  This procedure disables your third-party backup program.

1. Open your SYSTEM.INI file, and locate the [386Enh] section.

2. Determine whether any of the following lines are included in this
  section:

  DEVICE=FASTBACK.386
  DEVICE=VFD.386
  DEVICE=CPBVXD.386
  DEVICE=VIRWT.386

3. If you find any of these lines, add a semicolon (;) to the front
  of the line.

4. Save the file, restart Windows, and run Backup for Windows again.

Running Microsoft Backup with TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD computers
----------------------------------------------------------------
To avoid a conflict between the Turbo feature and Microsoft Backup
for Windows or MS-DOS, add a /L0 switch to the DEVICE command in
your CONFIG.SYS that loads the BATTERY.PRO file. Or, before you
run Microsoft Backup, type SETPOWER /L0 at the command prompt.

5.3 Microsoft CD-ROM Extensions
-------------------------------
Use the MSCDEX.EXE file that comes with MS-DOS 6.

If you load MSCDEX.EXE with a batch file or program,
make sure it loads the MSCDEX.EXE file that comes with
MS-DOS 6. The MS-DOS Setup program copies this file
to the directory that contains your MS-DOS files.

5.4 Microsoft Defragmenter
--------------------------
If you carried out the procedures in "An MS-DOS program displays
an out-of-memory message" in the chapter "Diagnosing and Solving
Problems" in the MICROSOFT MS-DOS 6 USER'S GUIDE, and still receive
an out-of-memory message when you run the Defragmenter, there might
be too many files on your hard disk for the Defragmenter to organize.
For the Defragmenter to work correctly, you might need to
delete some files or move them to a floppy disk or a network drive.

5.5 MS-DOS Shell
----------------
Setup will not update your DOSSHELL.INI file. As a result, the
programs listed in the Disk Utilities group will not be updated. For
example, if your Disk Utilities group included "Backup Fixed Disk" or
"Restore Fixed Disk," these program items may no longer be valid. In
addition, if you installed Microsoft Backup, Anti-Virus, or Undelete
for MS-DOS, these program items will not be listed. You must add and
delete the program items yourself. For information about adding and
deleting program items, see MS-DOS Shell Help.

6. THIRD-PARTY PROGRAMS
=======================

6.1 4DOS and NDOS
-----------------
4DOS (prior to 4.02) and NDOS (prior to Norton Utilities 7.0) are
compatible with MS-DOS 6. However, to use some of the new features
in MS-DOS 6 (such as MemMaker, the LOADHIGH /L switch, DIR compression
switches, and so on), contact JP Software for an update to 4DOS 4.02
or later, or Symantec for an update to Norton Utilities 7.0 or later.

If you use multiple configurations, 4DOS or NDOS will not
automatically run your AUTOEXEC.BAT file unless you include a /P on
the SHELL line in your CONFIG.SYS file.

To use MS-DOS 6 Help instead of 4DOS or NDOS Help, start it by using
COMMAND /C HELP, or define a 4DOS or NDOS alias to run HELP.COM from
your MS-DOS 6 directory.

6.2 Above Board 286 and Above Board Plus Installation
   Programs
-----------------------------------------------------
Do not use an Above Board installation program dated May 1989
or earlier until you disable programs that use extended memory,
such as SMARTDrive or RAMDrive. You might lose data if you leave
these programs enabled. After you have installed Above Board,
you can reenable these programs.

6.3 After Dark for DOS (AD-DOS)
-------------------------------
If you run After Dark for DOS (AD-DOS) at the same time you
run programs that use DPMI, you might have problems with
MS-DOS--for example, your computer might stop running or you
might receive "packed-file corrupt" messages. Examples of programs
that use DPMI are Microsoft MASM61, C7, and FoxPro25.

6.4 CodeView
-----------
CAUTION  Using versions 3.0 to 3.13 of the CodeView CV.EXE
file may cause data loss if your system has an 80386 memory
manager (such as EMM386.EXE) and device drivers or programs
that use extended memory. To determine which version you
have, type CV.EXE at the command prompt.

6.5 Colorado Tape Backup
------------------------
If you receive a message that you have two versions of the
VFINTD.386 file loaded, you probably need to edit your
SYSTEM.INI file. To do so, carry out the following procedure:

1. Open your SYSTEM.INI file and locate the [386Enh] section.
  You should see two lines similar to the following:

  DEVICE=C:\TAPE\CMSDTAPE.386
  DEVICE=C:\DOS\VFINTD.386

2. If you plan to use your Colorado Tape Backup program, add a semi-
  colon (;) before the DEVICE command for the VFINTD.386 file. If you
  plan to use Microsoft Backup, add a semi-colon before the DEVICE
  command for the CMSDTAPE.386 file.

3. Save the file, and restart Windows.

6.6 Fastback Plus
-----------------
If you have a version of Fifth Generation Systems Fastback Pluse
earlier than 3.0, use the LOADFIX command before running Fastback Plus
or the Fastback Plus installation program to ensure that you don't
lose data. To do so, type the following at the command prompt:

LOADFIX FB.EXE

or

LOADFIX FBINSTAL.EXE

6.7 Norton Desktop for Windows 2.0
----------------------------------
Setup adds a second Tools menu which contains Microsoft Backup and
Antivirus commands (if you installed these Windows programs),
as well as a DoubleSpace Info command.

6.8 Norton Utilities
--------------------
The "Clear Space" option of Norton Speed Disk (prior to version 7.0)
is incompatible with DoubleSpace drives. For an updated version of
Norton Speed Disk, contact your software vendor.

Do not use the WipeInfo utility on DoubleSpace drives. It can cause
lost clusters. If you have already used this option, use the
DBLSPACE /CHKDSK /F command to fix the lost clusters.

6.9 PC Tools
------------
As reported by DoubleSpace CHKDSK, the DISKFIX /SCAN option
in PC Tools can cause lost clusters on DoubleSpace drives. If you
have already used this option, use the DBLSPACE /CHKDSK /F command
to fix the lost clusters.

The FORMAT command of PC Tools version 7.1 conflicts with
MS-DOS 6. Use the FORMAT command that comes with MS-DOS 6.

The COMPRESS command of PC Tools versions 6.0 and 5.5
is incompatible with DoubleSpace.

6.10 QEMM-386 (6.02 or earlier)
-------------------------------
Quarterdeck's QEMM memory manager is compatible with MS-DOS 6.
Quarterdeck has a Technical Note #166, MSDOS6.TEC, which discusses
how to get the most out of running their products with MS-DOS 6. This
technote can be obtained from their BBS, Compuserve (GO QUARTERDECK,
Library 2), BIX (JOIN DESQVIEW), and their Q/FAX automated fax-back
service.
