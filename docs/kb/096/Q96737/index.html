SUMMARY
=======

At times FTADMIN will incorrectly show phantom drives and/or phantom errors.
These problems, though surprising, are easily correctable.

PROBLEM ID: BUG# 406

SYMPTOMS
========

  At times FTADMIN will report drives as being cracked, displaying a question
  mark (?) where the drive letter should be. Viewing information about the
  drive will show a code ???, critical level, a disk block with a ridiculous
  number (4291035135, 4294967295 and 4294905600 have been seen, even if the
  block size was 512 bytes [these figures represent a location of just under 2
  terabytes]) and a drive type unknown. This can occur on "raw" drives (not
  partitioned) or it can be a truly "phantom" (non- existent) drive. When
  &lt;Correct all errors on drive&gt; is selected a Net 2533 will be produced.
  Choosing OK at this point will cause the cracked drive to go away.

CAUSE
=====

  There are at least two known ways to produce this problem. The first is to go
  into FDISKPM, create a partition on a "raw" drive, and exit the program
  without saving the changes. Making a change and exiting FTSETUP without
  saving the changes will produce the same result. This problem appears to
  persist through system shutdowns and reboots, but not through a power down
  and reboot. The other known way to produce this problem is to attempt to run
  the Verify option of FTADMIN (locally) and WFTADMIN (remotely) at the same
  time (see related article on concurrency).

RESOLUTION
==========

  As mentioned earlier, choosing OK after receiving the Net 2533 message will
  cause the cracked drive to go away.

  Attempting to correct the phantom drive by selecting &lt;Correct&gt; then
  &lt;All errors on all drives&gt; may not work. The phantom drive itself may
  have to be selected and then use &lt;Correct&gt;, &lt;All errors on selected
  drive&gt;.
