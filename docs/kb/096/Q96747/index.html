-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft provides a replacement for the VFORMS.DLL file that is included with
versions 3.0b and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks.

For complete information about obtaining and installing the VFORMS.DLL file, see
the following sections:

- To download the updated file

- To update your VFORMS.DLL file

MORE INFORMATION
================

This update contains VFORMS.DLL, a replacement for the VFORMS.DLL file that is
included with versions 3.0b and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows. This
replacement file provides additional enhancements to the original VFORMS.DLL,
resolving the following two problems that can occur when attachments are
launched using version 3.0 of Microsoft Mail for Windows:

- When you attempt to launch attachments that do not have an extension, an
  error occurs when you hold down the ALT key and double-click the mouse button
  to load the attachment in Notepad.

- When you attempt to launch MACBINARY attachments, Mail for Windows changes
  the name of the file being launched if that filename is less than eight
  characters in length.

This replacement file also resolves the following problems that can occur when
you use version 3.0b or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows:

- When you open a MAPI Send note through a Windows-based application (for
  example, Microsoft Word or Microsoft Excel) and the application is launched
  again via Mail, the application is brought to the front, but the Send note is
  left in the background. If the application is running full screen, the
  computer hangs because the active window (the Send note) will accept any
  keystrokes; however, it is hidden by the full-screen application.

To Download the Updated File
----------------------------

The following self-extracting file is available for download from the Microsoft
Software Library:

  Vformupd.exe
  (http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/Vformupd.exe)

For more information about downloading files from the Microsoft Software Library,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services



After you download VFORMUPD.EXE to a clean directory, run it (by typing
"vformupd" (without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt) to extract the
contents of the file. You should receive the following files:

  VFORMS.DLL (143,552 bytes, dated 01-28-94, 2:56 P.M.)
  README.TXT

To replace your VFORMS.DLL file
-------------------------------

1. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

  " copy &lt;drive&gt;:\vforms.dll &lt;destination&gt; " (without the quotation
  marks)

  where &lt;path&gt; is the drive and directory where you ran the self-
  extracting VFORMUPD.EXE file and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and
  directory where your VFORMS.DLL file currently resides. This directory should
  also contain the Microsoft Mail for Windows SETUP.EXE program. For example,
  if you ran the self-extracting file from the TEST directory on drive D, and
  your VFORMS.DLL file is located in the MAILEXE directory on drive C, type the
  following command:

  " copy d:\test\vforms.dll c:\mailexe " (without the quotation marks)

2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

  " copy &lt;mailexe&gt;\setup.inf &lt;mailexe&gt;\setupinf.old " (without the
  quotation marks)

  where &lt;mailexe&gt; is the complete path to the directory containing the
  Microsoft Mail for Windows SETUP.EXE program. For example, if SETUP.EXE is
  located in the MAILEXE directory on drive C, type the following command:

  " copy c:\mailexe\setup.inf c:\mailexe\setupinf.old " (without the quotation
  marks)

3. Using any text editor, edit the SETUP.INF file. In the [MsMail System]
  section, replace the following line

  1, vforms.dll,,,, 1993-03-09, !DECOMPRESS,, OLDER, !READONLY ,,,,, SHARED,
  142960,,,, 3.2.0.4027 ,

  with:

  1, vforms.dll,,,, 1994-01-28, !DECOMPRESS,, OLDER, !READONLY ,,,,, SHARED,
  143552,,,, 3.2.0.4064 ,

  Save the file and close the text editor.

  NOTE: For these changes to affect the entire network, each existing user must
  run Setup again.
