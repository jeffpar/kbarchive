SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Backup for MS-DOS and Microsoft Backup for Windows both use "disk
change detection" to speed up the backup process. This article discusses this
feature.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Disk change detection is enabled during the configuration process for Backup.
During the configuration process, Backup prompts you to remove all floppy disks
from your disk drives so that it can test whether the drives can automatically
detect when a disk is inserted. If the floppy disk drives pass this test, disk
change detection is enabled.

During subsequent floppy-disk backups, you are prompted to insert the next disk
while the drive light is still on. This may be confusing to users who think that
removing floppy disks while the light is on may damage the disk drive or the
disk itself. This is part of the disk change detection process and removing the
disk when prompted does not damage either the disk or the disk drive. You also
have the option to wait until the disk drive light goes off; at that point, you
are again prompted to insert the next disk and instructed to press the ENTER key
to continue. If you wait until the drive light goes out and prompts you to
insert the next disk, Microsoft Backup appears to finish normally; however, the
second (or subsequent) disk may be blank. During a large backup, however, the
ability to swap disks "on the fly" can greatly reduce the total time you spend
backing up.
