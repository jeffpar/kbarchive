SUMMARY
=======

It is possible to verify printer ports directly on a 3Server using the COPY
command. This procedure allows isolation from the LAN Manager software and Print
Manager running on the 3Server. To copy directly to a printer port on the
3Server, do the following:

1. From an OS/2 workstation, log in as an administrator on the 3Server.

2. Do a NET ADMIN /C connection using the following command

     net admin \\servername /c

  where \\servername is the name of the 3server. You will now have a prompt that
  looks similar to below:

     [\\servername] _

3. From this command prompt, do a DIR command for *.CMD.

4. Select one of the listed files (these are OS/2 command files and are pure
  text).

5. Copy the selected file to the printer port (this could be LPT1 or COM1, for
  example, depending on what port the printer is connected to). The command is
  as follows:

     copy setmode.cmd lpt1

6. You should receive a "one file(s) copied" message. If the printer prints the
  file, you have then verified that the port and printer are functioning
  properly. If no printout is obtained, then a problem exists with either the
  port, printer, or printer cabling.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If your printer is a PostScript printer, use the following commands:

  copy con lpt1
  showpage
  ^z

After the command is entered, you should receive a "one file(s) copied" message.
SHOWPAGE is the PostScript command to eject a page. On some older machines, you
may need to add the /B switch to the line. For example,

  copy file.txt lpt1 /b

This command sends the file in binary format, thereby avoiding any end-of-file
problems.
