SUMMARY
=======

You can use the LOADHIGH switches /S and /L together to control where programs
are loaded in upper memory blocks (UMBs) and how much space they allocate. Both
switches affect the way programs interpret UMBs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you load a program with the /L switch, the program only recognizes the memory
regions you specify in the /L parameters. If you load a program with the /S
switch, the program only recognizes the regions you specify and the amount of
memory you specify--these switches are useful if you are optimizing conventional
memory because you can restrict the way a program uses a particular memory
region.

For example, the SMARTDrive utility has the ability to load itself into UMBs: it
is first loaded and initialized in conventional memory and then is relocated to
the largest available UMB it finds. By default, SMARTDrive attempts to load as
much of itself as it can into UMBs; other programs will not be able to use free
UMBs because SMARTDrive has used too much space. Since SMARTDrive does not have
to reside in one memory area, you can use your UMBs more efficiently by forcing
SMARTDrive to use only a certain amount of UMB space. You can accomplish this by
using the /L and /S switches together.

The following command line (from AUTOEXEC.BAT) tells SMARTDrive that only region
0 (conventional memory) and 3 are free:

     loadhigh /l:0;3,42416 /s =c:\dos\smartdrv.exe

SMARTDrive is first loaded and initialized in conventional memory (region 0) and
then relocates itself to region 3. Since the /L switch specifies a minimum size
of 42416 bytes and the /S switch changes this minimum to the absolute value free
in region 3, SMARTDrive only recognizes region 0 and 3 as free and only
recognizes 42416 bytes available in region 3. Therefore, SMARTDrive loads 42416
bytes of itself into region 3 and the rest in region 0.This loading process
results in more free memory in region 3 because SMARTDrive is not able to
relocate all of itself in that region. The next program you load with the
LOADHIGH command has enough space to load completely and your available
conventional memory is increased.

For more information on the LOADHIGH command and its switches, use MS-DOS Help by
typing "HELP LOADHIGH" (without the quotation marks) at any MS-DOS command
prompt.
