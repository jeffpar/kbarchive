SUMMARY
=======

DIRECTORY SYNCHRONIZATION ERROR AND STATUS MESSAGES #120 - 249
--------------------------------------------------------------

On Microsoft Mail for PC Networks version 3.0 Server Disk 1, there is a file
called DIRSYNC.TXT that contains the error codes used in directory
synchronization (Dir-Sync) and in the IMPORT utility for Mail. The errors are
logged in the DIRSYNC.LOG file.

  [120] Requestor not registered

  The specified requestor is not registered with the directory server
  postoffice. Instruct the requestor administrator to register with the
  Administrator program Config Dir-Sync Requestor Registration command. The
  directory server administrator should also create the requestor with the
  Administrator program Config Dir-Sync Requestors Create command.

  [123] Could not compress file

  The directory server could not back up the master update file MSTTRANS.GLB or
  the server configuration file. Ensure that there is still a connection to the
  server and try the operation again. Also check that there is sufficient disk
  space to perform the compression.

  [124] Invalid transaction format

  Ensure that there is sufficient disk space to perform the operation.

  If the requestor is a foreign requestor, ensure that:

- The system message is in the correct format and starts with [dirsync]

- The foreign requestor did not forget to include an attachment file if one was
  specified

- If there is an attachment file, it is in the correct format and starts with
  [dirsync-transactions]

  Wait at least one synchronization cycle and the problem should clear itself
  up.

  [125] Failure to copy attachment file

  Ensure that there is sufficient disk space at the directory server postoffice
  to perform the operation.

  If the attachment is from a foreign requestor, check that the foreign
  requestor did not forget to send an attachment with the system message. Wait
  at least one synchronization cycle as the problem will most likely clear up
  on its own.

  [128] Could not process requestor status report

  Ensure that there is still a connection to the server. Also ensure that there
  is sufficient disk space to receive the report. Wait at least one directory
  synchronization cycle and try the operation again. If the problem continues,
  contact Microsoft Product Support Services.

  [129] Could not find specified sync number

  Wait at least one synchronization cycle and the problem should clear on its
  own. If the problem continues, copy a backup of the MSTTRANS.GLB file, then
  ask all requestors to export their address lists.

  [133] Invalid Server Request

  Ensure that the directory server's requestor schedule does not have any
  errors. Check the requestor schedule. Ensure that there is enough time for
  the server mail to reach the requestor postoffice.

  [136] The local requestor is not registered

  Ensure that this postoffice is registered as the directory server with the
  Administrator program Config Dir-Sync Options command.

  [150] Could not append transactions to the updates file

  Ensure that:

- There is sufficient disk space to perform the operation.

- The computer running the Dispatch program has 640K of memory and that
  FILES=20 (minimum) in the CONFIG.SYS file.

  If the mail is from a foreign requestor, check that the foreign requestor did
  not forget to send an attachment with the system message. If the problem
  continues, wait at least one synchronization cycle as the problem will most
  likely clear up on its own.

  [151] Requestor configuration busy

  Try the operation again. If the problem continues, the REQCONF.GLB may be
  locked open. Contact your network vendor to determine how to find and close
  files that are locked open.

  [154] Non-delivery report from

  This is an information message. The requestor received a directory
  synchronization message that is not addressed to it and is not from a $SYSTEM
  (directory synchronization) mailbox. This message is put in the DIRSYNC.LOG
  file. The directory server may receive a directory synchronization message
  that is not addressed to a $SYSTEM mailbox. This message is redirected to the
  administrator.

  [155] Invalid DirSync profile from

  The directory server received a directory synchronization message with
  unknown TASK= values. The mail likely has a TASK= value that is not supported
  by the server. See [133]. This message is redirected to the directory server
  administrator who should notify the foreign requestor administrator of the
  problem.

  [156] Invalid DirSync password from

  The specified password in the directory synchronization system message does
  not match the password in that is registered with the directory server
  postoffice. The directory server administrator and the requestor
  administrator should determine which is the correct password.

  [157] DirSync software version out of sync

  Ensure that the directory server and all requestors have upgraded to version
  3.0.

  [158] Requestor not registered

  See [120].

  The specified requestor is not registered with the directory server
  postoffice. Instruct the requestor administrator to register with the
  Administrator program Config Dir-Sync Requestor Registration command. The
  directory server administrator should also create the requestor with the
  Administrator program Config, Dir-Sync, Server, Requestors, Create command.

  [159] Failure to send update mail to requestor

  Ensure that:

- There is still a connection to the server.

- That there is sufficient disk space to receive the mail.

- The computer running the Dispatch program has 640K of memory and that
  FILES=20 (minimum) in the CONFIG.SYS file.

  If the problem continues, wait at least one directory synchronization cycle
  and the problem should clear on its own.

  [161] Server configuration busy

  Try the operation again. If the problem continues, the SRVCONF.GLB may be
  locked open. Contact your network vendor to determine how to find and close
  files that are locked open.

  [162] Failure to transmit server updates

  Ensure that:

- There is still a connection to the server.

- There is sufficient disk space to receive the updates.

- The computer running the Dispatch program has 640K of memory and that
  FILES=20 (minimum) in the CONFIG.SYS file.

  If the problem continues, wait at least one directory synchronization cycle
  and as the problem should clear on its own.

  [163] Failure to copy server updates

  Ensure that:

- There is still a connection to the server.

- There is sufficient disk space to copy the updates.

- The computer running the Dispatch program has 640K of memory and that
  FILES=20 (minimum) in the CONFIG.SYS file.

  If the problem continues, wait at least one directory synchronization cycle
  and the problem should clear on its own.

  [166] Manual import required for

  The size of the message generated to send the directory synchronization
  updates to the specified requestor exceeds the limit set by the requestor. A
  manual import procedure as described in The Administrator's Guide is
  required.

  [201] Warning .USR file missing

  This is an information message. There is a postoffice without a list of
  users.

  [202] No Valid Postoffice found

  Try the operation again. If the problem continues, check for that the
  MASTER.GLB file is in the GLB directory. If it is not there, it may have been
  accidentally deleted and you should restore a backup of your data files. If
  it is there, it may be locked open. Contact your network vendor to determine
  how to find and close files that are locked open.

  [203] GAL Rebuild problem accessing files

  Ensure that:

- There is sufficient disk space to perform the operation.

- The computer running the Rebuild utility has 640K of memory and that FILES=20
  (minimum) in the CONFIG.SYS file.

- Novell users have sufficient access rights.

  [204] GAL Rebuild out of disk space

  The Rebuild utility needs extra temporary disk space during sort and merge
  operations. Ensure that there is sufficient disk space to perform the
  operation.

  [249] Not enough free file handles

  Ensure that the computer running the Rebuild utility has 640K of memory and
  that FILES=20 (minimum) in the CONFIG.SYS file.
