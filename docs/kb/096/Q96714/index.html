SUMMARY
=======

The object of Microsoft Windows Entertainment Pack Volume 2's Pipe Dream game is
to score as many points as possible by constructing a continuous pipe from a
starting piece. When the game begins, sections of pipe appear at the bottom of a
dispenser to the left of the playing field. These pipes are placed on the
playing field by clicking the mouse on the desired square on the field. A pipe
can be placed anywhere on the field regardless of whether it connects with other
pipe sections.

Restrictions that apply when placing the pipe sections include:

1. Pipe sections cannot be rotated.

2. The order in which pipe sections appear cannot be changed.

3. A pipe section cannot be skipped and returned to later. Pipes must be played
  as they come.

Place as many pipes as are indicated in the top right corner of the screen, and
connect to the end piece (if there is one). When Pipe Dream's fluid has flowed
through the indicated number of pipes and into the end piece, you are assured
advancement to the next level.

Upon reaching a bonus level, you will be given a password. To return to that
level, choose the level number from the Skill menu and enter the password.

Scoring for Pipe Dream is as follows:

Fifty points for each pipe the fluid flows through until the number of pipes
required to advance to the next level has been attained. One hundred points for
each pipe the fluid flows through after the number of pipes required to advance
to the next level has been attained. Five hundred points for each time the fluid
crosses itself in a cross pipe. Five hundred points for each bonus or reservoir
section the fluid flows through until the number of pipes required to advance to
the next level has been attained. One thousand points for each bonus or
reservoir section the fluid flows through after the number of pipes required to
advance to the next level has been attained. One thousand points for using the
end piece, and ten thousand points if the fluid crosses itself in five
crosspieces. Penalties include 100 points at the end of every round for each
unused pipe; 50 points for each replacement of a pipe section. After the fast
forward key has been selected, every pipe the fluid flows through earns double
the usual point value.

NOTE: Some users have experienced unexpected results playing Pipe Dream above
level 36. Occasionally the starting piece may be obstructed by an unmovable
square preventing that level from being played.
