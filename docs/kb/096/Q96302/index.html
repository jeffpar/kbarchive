-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft FoxBASE+ for Macintosh, version 2.01 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are printing a report in FoxBASE+/Mac that has a line or lines in
either the group header or group footer, the line may print for only the first
data group that is printed on the page. On subsequent pages, the line will print
in the same position as it did on the first page regardless of where the other
data groups start or stop. This behavior occurs if one (or both) ends of the
line is positioned outside the boundaries of the report.

RESOLUTION
==========

Using the mouse to draw a line on a report normally keeps the ends of the line
within the boundaries of the report. However, it is possible to position one or
both ends of the line outside the report boundaries. Below are the steps to
accomplish this. To get the line inside the boundaries of the report, you can
reverse these same steps, or you can delete the line and draw it again.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Draw a line in a group header or group footer report band. The report needs
  to have a data grouping.

2. Make sure the line is selected. It will have little black squares at both
  ends if it is selected.

3. Use the LEFT ARROW or RIGHT ARROW key to move one end of the line off the
  edge of the report.

4. Using the mouse, grab the end of the line that is still on the report and
  make the line longer.

5. Preview the report.

The line will appear only once on the first page and then in the same position on
subsequent pages.
