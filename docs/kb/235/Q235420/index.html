Do I Need VBRun60sp4.exe File?
------------------------------

The VBRun60sp4.exe file is not intended to replace the Package and Deployment
Wizard (PDW) for distributing Visual Basic applications. For example, if your
application includes components such as ActiveX controls or DLLs, you should use
the PDW or a third-party setup package for distribution. However, if your Visual
Basic application only depends upon the files included in the VBRun60sp4.exe
file, you can distribute your application by providing end users with the
executable (.exe) file and VBRun60sp4.exe.

To determine whether your application requires additional files for distribution,
you can use the PDW to create a set of setup files as a test. When the PDW
creates a setup package, the PDW also creates a Setup.lst file. You can open the
Setup.lst file in any text editor (for example, Notepad). If the [Setup1 Files]
section of the resulting Setup.lst file only lists your .exe file, end users
should be able to run your application after running VBRun60sp4.exe to install
the core run-time files. However, if the [Setup1 Files] section contains
multiple files, you should consider using the PDW or a third-party setup package
for distribution instead.

In addition to distributing simple executables, you can also use the
VBRun60sp4.exe file for the following:

- To minimize the size of Internet downloads of Visual Basic applications

  By running the Vbrun60sp4.exe file ahead of time, users can download your
  application from the Web faster.

- As a troubleshooting step when an installation of Visual Basic or a Visual
  Basic application fails

  If Setup fails with an error message that mentions one of the core files or if
  registration of a component fails during Setup, the core files on the target
  computer might be mismatched. If the versions of the files in the
  VBRun60sp4.exe file are newer than the versions on the target computer, you
  might resolve the problem by running the VBRun60sp4.exe file before you run
  Setup.

For additional information about a specific example of a Setup problem that is
resolved by running VBRun60.exe, click the article number below to view the
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q194754 SETUP.EXE File Linked to Missing Export OLEAUT32.DLL:185

You can also obtain the VBRun60.exe file by extracting it from the VBRun60.cab
file available on the Visual Basic and Visual Studio CDs. The VBRun60.cab file
is located in the following folder on the Visual Basic 6.0 CD (Disk 1):

  \common\tools\vb\cabinets

On the Visual Studio 6.0 Professional CDs, the VBRun60.cab file is located in the
same relative path on Disk 2. On the Visual Studio 6.0 Enterprise CDs, it is
located on Disk 3.

NOTE: The version of the VBRun60sp4.exe file included in this Knowledge Base
article differs from the one on the installation CD. The version included in
this article is the latest version that ships with Visual Studio 6.0 Service
Pack 4.

You can use the Extract utility to extract the VBRun60.exe file from the cabinet
file, VBRun60.cab. The Extract.exe file is located in your Windows folder or on
your Windows 95, Windows 98, or Windows NT installation CD. From an MS-DOS
command prompt, you can run the following command to extract the file in the
cabinet file into the current directory:

  Extract Vbrun60.cab
