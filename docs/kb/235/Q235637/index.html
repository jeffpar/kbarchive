-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After the Systems Management Server (SMS) Remote Control Services Manager
performs the client verification cycle and you restart your computer, the SMS
Remote Control Agent may be uninstalled.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the Remote Control Services Manager is unable to stop
the Remote Control Agent. When this occurs, the service is marked for deletion
when you next restart your computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem and stop the Remote Control Agent from being marked
for deletion, ensure that the service can stop correctly. For additional
information about the only known issue that prevents the service from stopping
correctly, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q173594 SMS: Remote Control Agent Hangs on Startup and Shutdown

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the SMS Remote Control Agent service is reinstalled, or repaired through
the Systems Management tool in Control Panel, the service is first uninstalled
if it already exists. Before actually uninstalling the service, the Remote
Control Services Manager attempts to stop the Remote Control Agent.

If the attempt to stop the Remote Control Agent does not work, the service is
only marked for deletion. The subsequent command to install the agent finds it
still running and no problems are reported even though the service is pending
uninstallation. When the client is restarted, the Microsoft Windows NT Service
Control Manager removes the SMS Remote Control Agent service because it is still
marked for deletion.

The following entries in the %windir%\MS\SMS\Logs\RemCtrl.log file always
accompany this problem:

********** RCSvcs - Starting Remote Control Services Manager **********  
RCSvcs:  Commanded to Stop and remove WUSER32 Service.  
RCSvcs - Stopping WUSER32 service.  
RCSvcs - WUSER32 service stopped, return code 1.  
RCSvcs - Deleting WUSER32 service.  

The return code of "1" indicates a problem when stopping the service.
