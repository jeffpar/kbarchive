-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When viewing a collection through the Systems Management Server Administrator
Console, a user may not be able to see members of that collection, even though
the user has been granted explicit READ instance rights to that collection. In
addition to granting a user READ rights to a named collection, the READ RESOURCE
right must also be granted in order for a result list to be produced. This
workaround is necessary only prior to Systems Management Server Service Pack 1
(SP1). After the application of SP1 it is only necessary to add READ instance
permissions to the collection.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 2.0. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):
