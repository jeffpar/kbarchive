-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Internet News Service fails to receive a push feed from an authorized
Internet news provider. When the newsfeed provider issues an IHAVE command to
the Exchange Server computer, the following error message may occur:

  500 command not recognized.

CAUSE
=====

The Internet News Service has failed to validate the newsfeed provider as an
accepted server.


RESOLUTION
==========

In addition to specifying the Remote USENET Site Name and Host Name, the IP
address or fully qualified domain name of the newsfeed server needs to be added
to the Additional Inbound Hosts (Remote host name) field. It is recommended that
the IP address be used to avoid any name resolution problems.

When configured correctly, the "Newsfeed type" listed on the General tab of the
Newsfeed will read either "Newsgroups are accepted inbound," or "Newsgroups are
accepted inbound and pushed outbound." You cannot edit the newsfeed property
after it has been configured. When you are running the Newsfeed Setup Wizard, be
sure that the "Inbound newsfeed type" is set to "Accept incoming messages
(typical)."

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server,
version 5.5.


Additional query words: nntp, ihave, command, telnet
