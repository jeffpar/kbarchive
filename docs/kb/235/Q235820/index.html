-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a package is advertised to a collection of users, the package program may
be executed by a user who is not a member of the collection.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because Systems Management Server (SMS) creates per-user
offers only when the advertisement is configured to use the "Run once for every
user who logs on" feature. If an advertisement is configured to use the "Run
once for first user who logs on" feature, the advertisement appears, regardless
of the account that is used to log on.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server version 2.0 Service Pack 2.
