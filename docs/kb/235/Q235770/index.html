The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Some Microsoft Windows client computers (Windows 95 or Windows 98) running
Novell's IntranetWare client version 2.5 or 3.1 may experience an error 8890
(object already authenticated)when installed with Microsoft Systems Management
Server client software.

Environments in which this may occur could include the following systems and
configurations:

- Windows 95 or Windows 95 OSR2
- Novell IntranetWare Client32 version 2.5 or 3.1
- Clients running both IP and IPX protocols
- Windows NT Server 4.0 SP4 or greater
- Novell NetWare 4.x server acting as a CAP (Client Access point) or a Logon
  Point
- Site boundary including both IP and IPX
- Novell NetWare as the Primary network

Network traces have shown that in the first few minutes after the client is
installed, Microsoft Systems Management Server seems to generate numerous logon
and logoff requests to all Netware Directory Services (NDS)volumes. If you
attempt to logon during this period, you may encounter an error 8890. The client
may become unstable, or stops responding, which forces the computer to restart.

This is usually seen in environments with numerous Novell Servers that client
workstations can attach. In environments where there are only a couple of
servers, this is not likely to be an issue but once the number of servers
increases beyond 10, this could become a serious issue.


MORE INFORMATION
