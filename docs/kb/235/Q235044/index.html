MORE INFORMATION
================

LOC Page: Name And Address Of Online Press Have Changed
-------------------------------------------------------

Online Press has merged with another company and now has a new name and address.
Please replace the text in green on the LOC page with the following text:

"A Quick Course Education/Training Edition for this title is published by Online
Training Solutions, Inc. (OTSI). For information about supplementary workbooks,
contact OTSI at 15422 Bel-Red Road, Redmond, WA 98052, USA. 1-800-854-3344.
E-mail: quickcourse@otsiweb.com."


Page 12: Procedure Is Incorrect
-------------------------------

Step 1 contains some misleading information. Please delete the phrase "or choose
Slide from the View menu" from the first sentence, and end the sentence after
"work area."


Page 18: Step 1 Is Incorrect
----------------------------

There is incorrect information in step 1 of the second procedure on this page.
Please change the first sentence of step 1 to read:

"Click the Outline View button in the bottom left corner of the window."


Page 42: Incorrect Name Of Check Box
------------------------------------

The check box in step 2 is incorrectly named. It should be the Picture Frame
check box.


Page 75: Step 1 Is Incorrect
----------------------------

Step 1 contains extra, incorrect information. Please change it to read:

"Click the Outline View button."


Page 100: Step 2 Is Incorrect
-----------------------------

Step 2 in the first procedure on this page is incorrect. Please change it to read
as follows:

"...until the org chart fills the slide. Then click anywhere outside the chart to
see these results:"


Page 127: Step 1 Needs Several Changes
--------------------------------------

Step 1 on this page has several errors. It should read as follows:

"With the Travel template open in slide master views, select all the bulleted
text and the selections. Choose Bullets And Numbering from the shortcut menu to
display this dialog box."


Page 146: Procedure Is Incorrect
--------------------------------

Steps 5 and 6 on this page need to be reworded to make them correct. Please
reword them as follows:

"5. Press the P key until you return to Slide 2.

6. Press H to display the hidden slide. (This works only if the slide preceding
the hidden slide is displayed. If it's not, click the right mouse button and
choose Go and then By Title from the shortcut menu. Then from the By Title
submenu, choose (3) Customer Survey to display the hidden slide.)"


Page 149: Graphic Is Incorrect
------------------------------

The second graphic on page 149 needs to be replaced, as the Preview pane should
be on by default in this window.


Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
already contain most or all of the above corrections.
