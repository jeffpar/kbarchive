-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server 2.0 removes and then recreates the entire package on
the distribution points whenever an update is made to the package. This prevents
administrators from sending another package to update specific files on the
distribution point.

An Example
----------

Package A distributes a program and data file. This package is advertised.
Package B is an updated data file. This package is distributed to the same
share/directory as Package A.

As a result, Package A is overwritten by Package B. This is a change in behavior
from System Management Server 1.2.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for
Systems Management Server version 2.0. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

  S E R V P A C K

MORE INFORMATION
================

Service Pack 1 provides a registry key to control whether or not Update
Distribution Points delete the directory.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Components\SMS_DISTRIBUTION_MANAGER

  NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

  Value Name: Reserved Flags
  Data Type:  REG_DWORD
  Value:      0 (Default, Delete target) or 1 (Overwrite target)

4. Quit Registry Editor.
