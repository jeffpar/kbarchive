-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to advertise a program to Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0
clients, the program may not run and a 10003 status message may be reported for
the Advertisement status. The Smsapm32.log file on clients on which the issue
occurs may log the following entry:

  SCHED DATA : CAPScheduleData :: SetChangableData( C1UP0416, C1UP0416 ) APM
  ACCOUNT MGR : ERROR: NetUserGetLocalGroups failed for user DOM\SOFTDIST (1722)
  APM
  ACCOUNT MGR : WARNING: Could not ascertain rights for user 'DOM\SOFTDIST' APM
  SCHED DATA : Return code = 0x525; The specified user does not exist. APM

This problem occurs only when the following conditions exist:

- The SMS site server is a member server in a domain.

- A valid Windows NT Software Installation account has been specified in SMS
  Administrator Console.

- A program specifies that the Windows NT Software Installation account should
  be used.

- The program is advertised to Windows NT clients.

- Account lockout is enabled in the domain.

- Domain controllers in the domain have the SMS client software installed.

CAUSE
=====

The local workstation's SMSCliToknAcct&amp; account credentials are being used
to request authentication for the specified Windows NT Software Installation
account. These credentials are invalid for the domain account of the same name.
If account lockout is enabled, the account is locked out. When the account is
locked out, advertised programs that specify use of the Windows NT Software
Installation account do not run.

Note that this account may also be locked out for other reasons.
