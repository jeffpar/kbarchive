The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Advertised Programs Manager uses the Systems Management Server Windows NT
Client Software Installation account to support advertised programs on Windows
NT clients that require a special security context. Use this account when the
advertised program meets all three of these conditions:

- The installation is unattended.

- The program must use network resources other than the distribution point from
  which it was run.

- The program is not an application coded to use Systems Management Server or
  other explicit connection mechanisms.

You must create the Systems Management Server Windows NT Client Software
Installation account manually. Because this account will be used to gain access
to network resources required by the programs that are part of a package, you
should do the following:

1. Create the account as a domain account.

2. Give the account the rights needed to access the required network resources.

A minor change was made in Systems Management Server version 2.0 Service Pack 1
to the Program Environment tab in Program Properties. It clarifies the
requirements and functionality available with the Windows NT Software
Installation Account.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Under Packages, choose an individual Package, then look at Programs. Click the
Environment tab under an individual Program Properties dialog.

Note the following changes:

The options for using user input and administrative rights required are now
grouped under a section called Run Mode and organized to reflect the following:

- The ability to Run with user's rights or Run with administrative rights are
  mutually exclusive, using option buttons instead of check boxes.

- Provided the Program can run: option is set to Whether or not a user is
  logged on or Only when no user is logged on, when you select Run with
  administrative rights, you can also click to check a subordinate box to
  specify that the Windows NT client software installation account be used.

When the option to use the Windows NT client Software Installation account is
selected, the specified program will be run under the context of that account,
also using it to connect to required network resources.

STATUS

2.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for Systems
