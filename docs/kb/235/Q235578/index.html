IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

When the SNABase service is started on an SNA Server, it registers the IP
addresses that are already assigned to the network adapters of that particular
computer against its service table.

If an IP address is not yet assigned to a network adapter at SNABase startup, it
won't be added to the service table.

A new feature was added to SNA Server that allows you to add static IP addresses
for SNA Server's service table entry for the local computer. By specifying the
addresses, you can ensure that late bound IP addresses get passed to all clients
and servers during service table updates.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This feature is available in the latest service pack for SNA Server version 4.0.
For additional information, click the following article number to view the
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack

To enable this feature, you must add the registry value as described below:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Snabase\Parameters\SnaTcp

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

  Value Name: SnaServerStaticAddresses
  Data Type: REG_MULTI_SZ
  Value: &lt;IP Address to be assigned, for example 191.43.101.1&gt;

4. Quit Registry Editor.

This feature was first included in SNA Server version 4.0 Service Pack 3.
