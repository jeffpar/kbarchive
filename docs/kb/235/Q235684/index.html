The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The released version of the Systems Management Server Software Development Kit
(SDK) for version 2.0 is now available for download as part of the platform SDK.
This product was previously named "SMS Toolkit" in its Beta forms, and this
release directly supercedes the existing Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0
Beta 3 Toolkit. This article addresses the most common questions about the
Systems Management Server SDK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Question
--------

What's in the SMS 2.0 SDK?

Answer
------

The SDK contains documentation and sample applications for developing SMS
applications which integrate or utilize the SMS Admin UI, SMS Provider (server
side apps) and client side applications. Most of the sample applications make
use of WMI APIs, and the docs reference WMI and MMC SDK's.

Question
--------

How do I download the SMS 2.0 SDK?

Answer
------

The setup is located at:

http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/platformsdk/setuplauncher.htm

Select the link to "Platform SDK Setup".

Choose Custom install and for a minimal SMS SDK installation you should select
the following components:

  Documentation /  Management Services / Microsoft Management Console
  Documentation /  Management Services / Systems Management Server
  Documentation /  Management Services / Windows Management
  Instrumentation
  Documentation /  Networking/ Network Monitor
  Build Environment / Systems Management Server Headers and Libs
  Build Environment / WMI Headers and Libs
  Tools / Systems Management Server Tools
  Sample Code -&gt; Management Samples / Systems Management Server samples
  Sample Code -&gt; Management Samples / WMI samples

The entire SDK starting point platform is available at the following website:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?URL=/library/psdk/portals/mainport.htm

Question
--------

Q: How do I build the C++ samples?

Answer
------

The C++ samples need to be pointed to the header and lib locations before they
can successfully build.

To set header file directory:

1. In msdev choose Tools menu and then select Options and then select
  Directories

2. Select the "Directories" tab

3. From the drop-down menu select show directories for and then choose Include
  files

4. Add a new path entry and set it to Root Location\Platform SDK\INCLUDE where
  Root Location is the root directory of the platform SDK installation.

To set lib directory:

1. Create a directory called "Lib" in the directory Root Location\Platform
  SDK\samples\SysMgmt\SMS\VC

2. Copy Wbemuuid.lib from Root Location\Platform SDK\Lib to this new directory.

Question
--------

When will the SMS 2.0 SDK be on the MSDN CDs?

Answer
------

The entire SMS 2.0 SDK will be in the July 99 quarterly MSDN release. The April
99 MSDN release did contain the SMS 2.0 SDK documentation, but it was missing
the samples. Jan 99 MSDN and prior versions contained the SMS 1.2 SDK only.

Question
--------

Is there a Network Monitor (Netmon) 2.0 SDK available?

Answer
------

The Netmon 2.0 documents are in the Platform SDK, but it is missing the netmon
samples and build environment. If you need the Netmon build environment for the
SMS Beta 3 Toolkit it is shipping in the Back Office Resource Kit 4.5 ).


Question
--------

How do I obtain the SMS 1.2 SDK now that the SDK platform has only the 2.0
version?

Answer
------

The 1.2 sample files are included in the new platform SDK, but the documentation
is not. Currently the only method of obtaining the documentation is from an
older MSDN release (Jan 99 or previous).
