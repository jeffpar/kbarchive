-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you migrate users and meetings that contain attachments from Novell
GroupWise version 4.x to Microsoft Exchange Server, and then view the migrated
meetings in an e-mail client, the text from the Notes field may appear in the
Subject field. When this occurs, the Subject field contains the original text
from the Subject field, several spaces, the word "Notes," and then the text from
the Notes field.

Note that this problem only occurs if you are running version 5.5.2204.0 or later
of the Mlmig32.dll file.


CAUSE
=====

When you migrate meetings that contain attachments from GroupWise to Exchange
Server, the Subject field may not be properly terminated in the Schedule+
Interchange (.sc2) file. When this occurs, Exchange Server may append the Notes
field to the end of the Subject field.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

STATUS

version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 3.
