The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Software Metering clients, both in offline and online mode, connect to the
Software Metering server on a regular basis to transfer data. If the primary
Software Metering server is unavailable, the client might continually try to
connect to it rather than try the next available server.

This behavior is the same for both offline and online Software Metering clients.

However, there is no need for offline clients to continually try to connect to
their Software Metering server when there are others available to connect to.
Offline clients only have to upload saved Software Metering data that can be
sent to any available Software Metering server, they do not have to wait for the
primary server to become available.

CAUSE
=====

Because licenses are allocated to Software Metering servers based on demand,
online Software Metering clients should stay with a Software Metering server
once assigned. This logic also applies to offline Software Metering clients.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server 2.0. For additional information, click the following article number to

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Systems Management Server 2.0.
This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack
Service Pack 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, do the following at the SMS Site Server:

1. Stop the SMS_EXECUTIVE and the SMS_Site_Component_Manager services.

2. Replace the licclint.exe in the
  &lt;sms_root_directory&gt;\inboxes\clicomp.src\licmtr\&lt;platform&gt;\
  directory with the version obtained from the hotfix.

3. Replace the liccli95.exe in the
  &lt;sms_root_directory&gt;\inboxes\clicomp.src\licmtr\i386\ directory with
  the version obtained from the hotfix.

4. Replace the compver.ini in the
  &lt;sms_root_directory&gt;\inboxes\clicomp.src\licmtr\ directory with the
  version obtained from the hotfix.

5. Restart the SMS_EXECUTIVE and the SMS_Site_Component_Manager services. The
  files are replicated to the client access points (CAPs) and the logon points.
  Once this occurs, the clients will be updated at their next polling cycle.

NOTE: The default Client Configuration Installation Manager (CCIM) polling
interval is 23 hours. Therefore, it may take up to 23 hours for the files that
are in this hotfix to be propagated to the clients. To speed up this process,
you can stop and then restart the SMS Client Service on each client. You can
also create a software distribution by using the Setevnt.exe or the Cliutils.exe
Resource Kit tools. You must include the appropriate parameters to start a CCIM
work cycle. For information about the proper syntax for these tools, see the
Resource Kit documentation.
