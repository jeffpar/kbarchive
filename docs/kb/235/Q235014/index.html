MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 14: Reference To Incorrect Filling Type
--------------------------------------------

On page 14, in the second paragraph, change the reference so that it corresponds
with the last paragraph on the page.

Change:
"...Sweet Lil's has altered that recipe, changing the Candlelight Ecstasy filling
from raspberry to marzipan."

To:
"...Sweet Lil's has altered that recipe, changing the Candlelight Ecstasy filling
from mocha cream to marzipan."


Page 82: Steps Are Incorrect
----------------------------

On page 82 the steps in the "Set field properties" exercise are incorrect. The
steps should be as follows:

Change:
"Verify that the Carriers table is displayed in Datasheet view."

To:
"Verify that the Carriers table is displayed in Design view."

Step 2 should be removed, and the remaining steps should remain unchanged.


Page 124: Procedure Is Incorrect
--------------------------------

Please make the following changes to this procedure:

Delete all of step 5.

Renumber step 6 to step 5, and delete the result text:
"The Link dialog box replaces the Select Index Files dialog box."

Renumber step 7 to step 6.


Page 225: Callout Line Points To Wrong Part Of Graphic
------------------------------------------------------

The Detail section top callout line should stop right above the name "Alpine
Collection."


Page 234: Confusing Typo in Step 3
----------------------------------

The first step 3 at the top of the page has a confusing error. It should say:
"...click the New Object: AutoForm drop-down arrow..."


Page 236: Wrong Button Pictured in Quick Reference
--------------------------------------------------

The wrong button is pictured with the "Create an "instant" AutoReport using the
Standard format" how to. Use the New Object: AutoReport button instead.


Page 275: "Boxes" Should Be "Bonbons"
-------------------------------------

There are multiple errors in the steps on page 275.

In step3, change:
"select Table: Boxes."

To:
"select Table: Bonbons."

In step 3, change:
"list except BoxesID"

To:
"list except BonbonsID"

In step 5, change:
"with Boxes already"

To:
"with Bonbons already"


Last Page: Microsoft Access 2000 Is Not Included With This Book
---------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Access 2000 is not included with the title "Microsoft Access 2000 Step
by Step."

Please change the first paragraph on the last page to read:

"The enclosed CD-ROM contains ready-to-use practice files that complement the
lessons in this book. To use the CD, you'll need either the Windows 95, Windows
98, or the Windows NT version 4 operating system. You will also need to be
running Microsoft Access 2000."
