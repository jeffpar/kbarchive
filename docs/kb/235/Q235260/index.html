MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 17: Step 3 Is Incorrect

The result in step 3 is incorrect. The text should read:

"This is called an AutoFill pointer."


Page 17: Step 5 Is Missing
--------------------------

Step 5 on page 17 is missing entirely. Step 5 should read:

"Drag the AutoFill handle down to cell A9."


Page 32: Wrong Image Displayed
------------------------------

The image on the bottom of the page should be almost identical to the one
displayed on page 33. The current image depicts a spreadsheet from a few
chapters ahead.


Page 34: Typographical Error
----------------------------

On page 34, step 2 change:
"A5 though G5"

To:
"A5 through G5"


Page 52: Error In Sidebar
-------------------------

The sidebar on page 52 states that F5 or Ctrl+F will open the Find File dialog.
This is incorrect.

F5 will open the Go To dialog.
Ctrl+F will open the Find dialog.

To open the Find File dialog, you must select Open from the File menu, then click
the Tools button and select Find.


Pages 59 &amp; 60: Incorrect Instructions
-------------------------------------

The steps are incorrect and should read as follows:

1. Make sure cell E26 is selected.

2. No change.

3. No change.

4. Press Enter.

5. Double-click the border between columns E and F.
  Column E widens to fit $141.05.

Page 73: 4/25/00 Should Be 4/25/2000
------------------------------------

On page 73,

Change:
"The date is properly formatted as 4/25/00."

To:
"The date is properly formatted as 4/25/2000."


Page 124: Callout Points To The Wrong Part Of The Graphic
---------------------------------------------------------

In the graphic on page 124, the Summary Row callout line should point to row 38,
not row 35.


Page 175: Steps Are Misnumbered
-------------------------------

On page 175, step 8, change:
"Step 3 of 4"

To:
"Step 4 of 4"


Page 399: Procedure Contains Incorrect Information
--------------------------------------------------

In the text describing the first procedure on this page, there is incorrect
information. The screen settings for this book were "800 x 600" not "640 x
480."
