SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) version 2.0 clients cannot be manually
set up until Windows Networking Logon Client Installation (Logon Installation)
is enabled.

NOTE: SMS 2.0 requires Windows Networking Logon Client Installation to be enabled
if you want to manually install the SMS Client software. If you only have
Windows Networking Logon Discovery enabled, the files needed to install a client
in SMSLogon\Sites\&lt;site-code&gt; are unavailable.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In order for SMSMAN to successfully install a client, Logon Installation is the
only method required. If SMSMAN is the only installation method in use, then
Login Installation must be enabled. This has been the case with the product
since the products release in early 1999.

If the NT remote Installation (NT Push) method is enabled, then either Logon
Discovery or Network Discovery is required as NT Push picks up the Data
Discovery Record (DDR), creates a Client Configuration Request (CCR) and begins
the client installation routine.

If your clients connect to SMS by using NetWare, there are additional discovery
and installation methods that you must also enable on the SMS site system.

If your clients belong to a Novell Directory Services (NDS) tree and you have
configured the site system for NDS interoperability, you need to enable either
NetWare NDS Logon Discovery or NetWare NDS Logon Client Installation. If you do
not, the Smsman, Manboot, and Smsman16 files are not placed on the appropriate
volume for the clients to access.

If your clients log on using a Bindery context and you have configured the site
system for NetWare Bindery interoperability, you need to enable either NetWare
Bindery Logon Discovery or NetWare Bindery Logon Client Installation. If you do
not, the Smsman, Manboot, and Smsman16 files are not placed on the appropriate
volume for the clients to access.

In this case, attempting to run Smsman, Manboot, or Smsman16 from the
SMS\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt;\00000409 folder on the site server does not install a
client but instead generates the following error message:

  The wizard was unable to locate a Systems Management Server. Enter the name
  of a specific domain or server.

Typing the name of the site server or the domain in which the site server resides
also results in an unsuccessful installation attempt.

When you specify a server or domain, a "Searching for logon points" dialog box is
displayed. Eventually, the following error message is displayed:

  The wizard was unable to locate a Systems Management Server. Re-enter
  installation location.

These issues occur if no discovery or installation methods are enabled.

To be able to use Smsman, Manboot, or Smsman16, you must enable either a Logon
Discovery method (Windows, NDS, or Bindery) or a Logon Installation method
(Windows, NDS, or Bindery) to get logon points set up.
Smsman finds logon points by enumerating the domain controllers in its domain and
by analyzing any existing network connections the client currently has. These
connections include any to an NDS tree or a NetWare Bindery server.

For additional information, refer to the Microsoft Systems Management Server
Administrator's Guide, Part 2, Chapter 9, pages 278-281 (Logon Discovery) and
pages 285-287 (Logon Installation).

For more information about how to set up and configure a site system to use the
NetWare NDS or Bindery modes, see the "Integrating Microsoft Systems Management
Server 2.0 with Novell NetWare" white paper at the following Microsoft Web
