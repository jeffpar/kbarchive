-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Systems Management Server configurations where many sites share the same
domain, a large number of Systems Management Server accounts are created. For
each Systems Management Server site, a unique client connection account
(SMSClient_XXX) and server connection account (SMSServer_XXX) is created. For
example, in a domain where 500 Systems Management Server primary and secondary
sites exist, 1,000 client connection and server connection accounts are
created.

In such a configuration, you may want to limit the creation of such a large
number of accounts.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server 2.0.
This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack
Service Pack 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 1 provides a Setup command-line
method of manually specifying the client connection and server connection
accounts that are used in the domain. The accounts must already exist and have
the appropriate rights. When the accounts are manually specified, the Setup
program does not create the default SMSServer_XXX and SMSClient_XXX accounts.

The following example shows the syntax of the Setup command:

setup /ServerAccount DOMAIN\&lt;account&gt; /ServerPassword &lt;password&gt; /ClientAccount DOMAIN\&lt;account&gt; /ClientPassword &lt;password&gt;

For example, when you install a site, you want the Setup program to use
MyDomain\SMSServerAcct (password Elvis1) as the server connection account and
MyDomain\SMSClientAcct (password Elvis2) as the client connection account. You
can invoke the Setup program using the following syntax:

setup /ServerAccount MyDomain\SMSServerAcct /ServerPassword Elvis1 /ClientAccount MyDomain\SMSClientAcct /ClientPassword Elvis2

However, to use the command-line argument, you must run the Setup program
directly from the CD-ROM. Therefore, specifying a pre-created server and client
connection account is not possible for remote secondary site Setup.

To specify accounts for a secondary site, create an .ini file called
SMSAccountSetup.ini in the %Winnt%\System32 folder of the targeted secondary
site server. The .ini file lists the server and client account information in
the following format:

[ServerAccount]
Name=SMSServer
Password=Elvis1

[ClientAccount]
Name=SMSClient
Password=Elvis2

When the Setup program starts, it reads the SMSAccountSetup.ini file from the
%Winnt%\system32 folder. The accounts specified in the .ini file are treated the
same as the /ServerAccount and the /ClientAccount command-line arguments and the
default SMSServer_XXX and SMSClient_XXX accounts are not created.

If there is any need to reset a site, run the Setup program with the same command
line to manually specify the accounts again:

setup /ServerAccount DOMAIN\&lt;account&gt; /ServerPassword &lt;password&gt; /ClientAccount DOMAIN\&lt;account&gt; /ClientPassword &lt;password&gt;.

Otherwise, the default server and client connection accounts are created.

To change the password for the pre-created server or client connection account,
run the Setup program with the same command line as the initial installation
(this time specify the new passwords).

NOTE: This installation method only supports passwords up to 14 characters or
less in length, even though it is possible to create accounts and passwords that
exceed this limit at a command line in Microsoft Windows NT or in the graphical
user interface (GUI) with Microsoft Windows 2000.
