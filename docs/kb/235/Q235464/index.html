-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

You can configure Key Management servers (KM servers) so that two administrator
passwords are required to import a certificate. If you attempt to import a
certificate on a server configured in this manner, and you click Cancel when you
are prompted to enter the second password, the server may indicate that the
certificate was imported successfully even though you cancelled the operation.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Administrator Program

+---------------------------+
| File name    | Version    | 
+---------------------------+
| Kmsadmin.dll | 5.5.2635.0 | 
+---------------------------+


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can configure KM servers so that multiple administrator passwords are
required to perform various tasks. To configure a KM server in this manner:

1. Start the Administrator program. To do so, click Start, point to Programs,
  point to Microsoft Exchange, and then click Microsoft Exchange Administrator.

2. In the left pane, click the Configuration object under the appropriate site.
  In the right pane, click CA, and then on the File menu, click Properties. If
  you are prompted to enter your administrator password, type the password in
  the "KM Server password" box, and then click OK.

3. Click the Passwords tab, type the number of passwords required to import a
  certificate, and then click OK. For example, to configure the server so that
  two passwords are required to import a certificate, type "2" (without the
  quotation marks) in the "Import or untrust another Certification Authority's
  certificate" box.
