-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When multiple Systems Management Server sites using Windows Networking Logon
Client Installation and/or Windows Networking Logon Client Discovery share a
common domain, the senior site is responsible for updates to user profiles,
scripts, and logon point files. By default, senior sites are elected based upon
site code and version.

Administrators may need the ability to manually configure which site will serve
as senior site; for example, if the default senior site is across a slow link.

Systems Management Server Service Pack 1 (SP1) gives Administrators the ability
to specify which site will act as the senior site, without regard to
participating sites' version or site code.

To specify which site is to server as senior site, you need to create a
Senior.lst file in the smslogon\sitescfg directory on the PDC. The first three
characters of the file need to contain the desired site code.

NOTE: The site specified in the senior.LST file MUST participate in Logon Point
Management by having Windows Networking Logon Client Installation and/or Windows
Networking Logon Client Discovery enabled.

STATUS
------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server version
2.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for Systems
Management Server version 2.0. For information on obtaining the service pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

  S E R V P A C K



MORE INFORMATION
================

Administrators can create a Senior.lst file with any text editor; however, for
simplicity the example below uses the MS-DOS copy con command.

How to create a Senior.lst File
-------------------------------

1. Move to an MS-DOS command prompt.

2. Type "copy con Senior.lst" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER.

3. Type the desired three-character site code; for example, "XYZ" (without the
  quotation marks) and press ENTER.

NOTE: The SMS_NT_LOGON_SERVER_MANAGER service is case sensitive, so the site code
must be entered in uppercase text.

4. Press CTRL+Z.

5. Copy the Senior.lst file to your PDC; for example,
  \\server\smslogon\sitescfg.

To verify the new site specified is acting as the senior site, you can enable
logging for SMS_NT_LOGON_SERVER_MANAGER in Systems Management Server Service
Manager, then monitor the Nt_logon.log file. The senior site's Nt_logon log
states the following:

This site is senior site, updating all servers

For participating sites that are not acting as senior sites, the Nt_logon.log
file states the following:

This site is not the senior site, Site XXX is responsible for updating servers

NOTE: If this file does not exist then the senior site is the one with the
highest version of Systems Management Server which has either logon disc or
installation enabled. The proposed Senior Site must have either logon discovery
or logon installation enabled.
