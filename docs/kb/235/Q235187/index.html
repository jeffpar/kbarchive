-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Info Aps Service of Crystal Reports and the Microsoft Systems Management
Server (SMS) Executive Service may experience a General Protection Fault (GPF)
on a Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 site server connecting to an NDS Client Access
Point (CAP) and NDS Logon Point server.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because of a memory leak that may occur when the Novell
redirector is installed on a client that creates a connection to a NetWare
server or tree. The connection opens a series of handles that are never
released. Closing the connection with the server does not release the handles
that have been opened. This behavior can occur when you use Novell redirector
versions 4.7 and earlier.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, do one of the following:

- Remove the TCP/IP binding from the NetWare client redirector.

- Remove Domain Name System (DNS) from the Protocol Component Settings under
  the protocol preferences tab of the Novell Client Properties.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information about Novell redirector support, refer to the "Known Issues
Regarding Novell NetWare Client v4.7 for Windows NT/2000" section in the Systems
Management Server 2.0 SP2 release notes.
