-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During the information store storage warning cycle, you may see the following
warning logged in the Event Viewer:

  Event ID: 1025
  Source: MSExchangeIS Private
  Type: Warning
  Category: General
  Description: An error occurred.
  Function name or description of problem: EcDoDeliverMessage
  Error: 0x4d9

The user may also receive a storage limit warning message.

CAUSE
=====

A user or users have exceeded their mailbox storage limit and the storage
warning message is unable to be delivered to the user by the system attendant.

In situations where both a storage limit warning message is delivered to the user
and a 1025 event is logged, the user may have a rule set in his or her mailbox,
which is applied on the storage limit warning message. Because of the storage
quota limit, the rule cannot be applied, and event 1025 is logged.

RESOLUTION
==========

Have those users who have exceeded their mailbox storage limit clean out or
archive messages from their mailboxes. Or, raise or remove their mailbox storage
limit in the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use the Error.exe utility on the Exchange Server CD in the
Support\Utils\&lt;Platform&gt; folder to determine what error 0x4d9 means.

  Error 0x4d9 is:
  Error 1241 (0x4d9) = ecQuotaExceeded

To find out which users have exceeded their mailbox storage limits:

1. In the Exchange Server Administrator program, under Private Information
  Store, set Diagnostic Logging to Maximum on Storage Limits.

2. In the application log, look for these Event IDs:

  Event ID: 1077
  Source: MSExchangeIS Private
  Type: Warning
  Category: Storage Limits
  Description: The following users have exceeded the Issue Warning Storage
  Limit:

Depending on what storage limits you have set, you may also see these event IDs:

  Event ID: 1078
  Source: MSExchangeIS Private
  Type: Warning
  Category: Storage Limits
  Description: The following users have exceeded the Prohibit Send Storage
  Limit:

  Event ID: 1218
  Source: MSExchangeIS Private
  Type: Warning
  Category: Storage Limits
  Description: The following users have exceeded the Prohibit Send and Receive
  Storage Limit:
