  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are logged on to a server or workstation without administrative rights,
the logoff screen saver included in the Windows NT 3.51 and 4.0 Resource Kits
does not function properly.

You will also get the following error messages when attempting to use the utility
without administrative rights:

  Error encountered while creating registry key. Make sure you have set values
  and create subkey permissions.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

In order for non-administrators to be able to use WINEXIT, you must add Set Value
and Create Subkey permissions for the group Everyone on the following registry
key:

  HKEY_Local_Machine\Software\Microsoft\Windows
  NT\CurrentVersion\IniFileMappings\Control.ini

To do this, use the following steps:

NOTE: You must be logged on with administrative rights to make these changes.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Open the following key:

  HKEY_Local_Machine\Software\Microsoft\Windows
  NT\CurrentVersion\IniFileMappings\Control.ini

3. On the Security menu, click Permissions.

4. In the Name box, click Everyone, and then click Special Access in the "Type
  of Access" box.

5. Click to select the Set Value and Create Subkey check boxes.

6. Click OK, and then click OK.

7. Quit Registry Editor, and then restart the computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WINEXIT is a screen saver that logs the current user off after the specified
time has elapsed. In other respects, it is similar to other screen savers and
can be configured and tested on the Screen Saver tab of the Display Properties
dialog box in Control Panel.

WINEXIT displays a dialog box in which it displays the countdown timer and a
user-defined message. When the countdown timer reaches zero, the log off process
is initiated.

To install Winexit.scr before configuring:

1. Install the Windows NT Resource Kit on the workstation.

2. Locate the Winexit.scr file in the NTreskit folder.

3. Right-click the Winexit.scr file, and then click Install.

To activate WINEXIT, perform the following steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and click Control Panel, then
  double-click the Display icon.

2. On the Screen Saver tab, select Windows Exit from the Screen Saver list.

3. In the Wait box, select the number of minutes of inactivity before the screen
  saver appears.

4. To configure the screen saver, click Settings. In the Force Logoff box,
  select the Force Application Termination checkbox to have the system close
  all running applications regardless of their current state.

  By default, this checkbox is not selected and the system queries applications
  to see if work needs to be saved before forcing the application to quit. Use
  this setting with caution because applications with unsaved data will not
  have a chance to save their work.

5. In the Time To Log Off box, type the time WinExit will display its logoff
  dialog box before proceeding with the log off process. Type a value between 0
  and 999 seconds.

6. In the Logoff Message box, type a message to display in the logoff dialog
  box. The message is limited to 255 characters and will be truncated if extra
  characters are typed.

7. To start the screen saver temporarily, click the Preview button. To return to
  Windows, move your mouse.

  NOTE: You can now test Windows Exit screen saver by clicking Preview on the
  Screen Saver tab without WINEXIT attempting to log you off.

When activated, WINEXIT beeps, indicating that the logoff process is about to
begin, and displays the logoff dialog box. If no action is taken and the
countdown timer reaches zero, the system will initiate the log off procedure.
You can abort the process before the countdown timer reaches zero by either
moving the mouse pointer over the dialog box or pressing any key on the
keyboard.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51 &amp;
4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
