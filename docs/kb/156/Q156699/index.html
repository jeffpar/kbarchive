SUMMARY
=======

The Windows NT 4.0 System Policy Editor allows administrators to determine what
applications can be run on computers running Windows NT 4.0 by using the "Run
only allowed Windows applications" option.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The "Run only allowed Windows applications" entry under the System Restrictions
book of System Policy Editor can be assigned to specific users and groups, or to
default users.

Enabling this option limits what applications can be run on computers running
Windows NT 4.0, if the applications are called through the shell name space.

When a user attempts to run an application not specified in System Policy Editor,
the following error message is displayed:

  Restrictions: This operation has been canceled due to restrictions in effect
  on this computer. Please contact your system administrator.

Microsoft Office applications, including Office 95, include the utilities
Msinfo.exe and Msinfo32.exe. These applications bypass the shell name space and,
because of this, they are not monitored or restricted by the System Policy. This
allows users to run applications even if they are not listed in the System
Policy's "Allowed to run" list. Administrators may choose to customize
installations so these utilities are not installed.

Another consideration for System Policies is the use of reference accounts. A
reference account is a special user created specifically as the logon account
for the administrator who will be setting System Policies. Logging on as an
administrator named POLICY and setting policies under this account will help
prevent a situation in which even administrators cannot run server tools. It is
easy, by using the "Allowed to run" policy, to restrict even the administrator
account from running administration tools. Because of this it is better not to
manage System Policies while logged on as Administrator.
