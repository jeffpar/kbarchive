The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Visual FoxPro ships with a Solutions sample application, in
VFP\Samples\Solution\Solution.app in Visual FoxPro 5.0 or the MSDN directory
under Samples\vfp98\Solution\Solution.app in Visual FoxPro 6.0, that provides
examples for accomplishing common database and programming tasks. This article
offers some tips on how to find particular examples in the Solutions application
and more information about each example.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Solutions sample has a separate help file, in
VFP\Samples\Solution\Solution.hlp in Visual FoxPro 5.0 or the MSDN directory
under Samples\vfp98\Solution\Solution.chm in Visual FoxPro 6.0, that provides an
overview of the sample and a description of every element in the sample.

You can choose the Behind the Scenes button on any form to open the description
for that form. If you run a query or report from SOLUTION.APP, open the
description by pressing the F1 key. You can see a list of all components by
clicking on "List of Components" in the non-scrolling region of the Solutions
Sample topic. When you choose the Index button in the Help file, you can search
for samples by keywords. For instance, you could search for BEGIN TRANSACTION to
find the topic for the Nest Transactions sample.

You can also filter samples by category in the Solution form by choosing the
"View samples by filtered list" Option button. If you were interested in
examples using arrays, for example, you could choose "Array Manipulation" in the
drop-down list to display the samples that use arrays, whether or not that is
the primary focus of the sample.

Another way to look at the sample applications is to open SOLUTION.DBF. For
example:

     USE SOLUTION

     BROWSE FOR type != "N"

A type of "N" indicates that the record is not a sample, but rather a category
for the treeview in solution.scx. The DESCRIPT field contains a record for each
component in the Solutions sample and a brief description of the sample.
