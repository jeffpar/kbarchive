SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to set up a shared package of Microsoft Exchange on a
client running Windows NT.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Create a source directory for the Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client setup
  files (for example, C:\XNTFlat).

2. Create a directory called Msapps below the XNTFlat directory (for example,
  C:\XNTFlat\Msapps).

3. Run Setup /A for the Windows NT client from the Microsoft Exchange client
  compact disc, and install to the directories created in the previous steps.

4. From the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program group, run the Microsoft
  Exchange Setup Editor. Point the Setup Editor to the C:\XNTFlat directory.

5. Modify entries as necessary for your installation. NOTE: Remove Personal
  Folders if you want all clients to store their e-mail messages on the server.

6. To perform a totally unattended workstation installation, edit the Setup.stf
  file in C:\XNTFlat, making the following change:

  Change line 14 from:

          14    Network    AppMainDlg    21 22 23 24 : 25  382  17 ...

  To:

          14    Network    AppMainDlg    24 : 25  382  17 ...

  Line 14 tells the Setup program which options to present to the user when
  doing a network installation. By making this change, you are limiting the
  installation to a workstation installation, defined by line 24. The following
  is a list of the lines, and the options they represent:

  21 - Typical
  22 - Custom
  23 - Laptop
  24 - Workstation

7. Copy the Exwinnt.pdf file from the Exchange client compact disc to the
  Systems Management Server directory on your hard drive. Edit the file using a
  text editor such as Notepad, and add the following section below the [Setup
  Package for Sharing] section:

        [Program Item Properties 1]
        CommandLine=exchng32.exe
        Description=Microsoft Exchange NT Client
        ConfigurationScript=dosetup.exe exchange setup.exe /Q1
        RegistryName=exchange
        DefaultINIFile=
        RunMinimized=FALSE
        RunLocalCopyIfPresent=FALSE
        DriveMode=ANY_DRIVE_LETTER
        SupportedPlatforms=Windows NT 3.1 (x86)
        SetupIcon=
        DisplayIconInProgGroup=TRUE

8. Save the file and use it to create a shared package. When creating the
  package, you must still designate the source directory, designate the share
  point, and change the icon.

9. Create the program group and job to distribute the file.

The quiet mode of installation used in this .pdf file uses the following registry
key for the user's name:

    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\MS Setup(ACME)\User Info

If this is incorrect or somehow different from the Exchange mailbox, the user
must run Control Panel Mail and Fax to edit his or her profile. The key above
has two values: DefName (for the user name) and DefCompany (for the company
name).
