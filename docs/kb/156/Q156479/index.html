SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the major differences between the Win32 Data Link Control
(DLC) API as implemented on Windows 95 and Windows NT. It assumes familiarity
with the DLC protocol and the relevant specification documents. It also assumes
familiarity with the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article that describes
the differences between Windows NT DLC and the IBM Specifications for OS/2
1.xx:

  Q156081 Differences between Data Link Control APIs on Windows NT &amp; DOS

MORE INFORMATION
================

The differences between Windows 95 and Windows NT DLC are as follows:

1. The Windows 95 API continues to use the CCB Application ID field. In Windows
  NT and DLCAPI.H, this field is defined as uchReserved2 in the LCC_CCB
  structure and is commented as reserved for DLC DLL. A Windows 95 application
  must use this field as defined for OS/2 EE. That is:

   - Issue a DIR.OPEN.ADAPTER command with this CCB set to zero. The DLC driver
     will set this field to an Application ID value.

   - This Application ID must be used in subsequent CCB requests by setting
     uchReserved2 to this value.

  This difference is necessary because Windows 95 does not have support for the
  security mechanisms used by Windows NT in lieu of the application ID.

  See The IBM LAN Technical Reference Manual for more information.

2. The fields uchReserved1 and uchReserved3 must not be used by an application
  under any circumstances.

3. NT-specific extensions such as security, multiple processors, or
  international character strings are not supported.

4. Windows 95 continues to support the completion method of polling (busy
  looping) on the CCB's return code (uchDlcStatus in the LLC_CCB structure).
  This method is not reliable on Windows NT and an application that uses it on
  Windows 95 may not work on Windows NT.

5. Windows 95 allows a DIR.STATUS command to be issued before a DIR.OPEN.ADAPTER
  CCB. NT does not allow this. You should be aware of this when writing
  cross-platform applications.

6. Windows 95 does not support:

   - Multiple logical adapters.

   - TRANSMIT.FRAMES.CCB.

   - Direct station support that is global to all applications.

7. The Windows 95 802.2 implementation does support CCB 1's or a 16-bit DOS
  interface.

8. An application must issue a BUFFER.CREATE command before issuing any of the
  following CCBs:

  BUFFER.FREE              DLC.OPEN.SAP         XMIT.I.FRAME
  BUFFER.GET               DLC.OPEN.STATION     XMIT.DIR.FRAME
  DIR.CLOSE.DIRECT         DLC.REALLOCATE       XMIT.TEST.CMD
  DIR.OPEN.DIRECT          DLC.RESET            XMIT.UI.FRAME
  DLC.CLOSE.SAP            DLC.STATISTICS       XMIT.XID.CMD
  DLC.CLOSE.STATION        READ                 XMIT.XID.RESP.FINAL
  DLC.CONNECT.STATION      READ.CANCEL          XMIT.XID.RESP.NOT.FINAL
  DLC.FLOW.CONTROL         RECEIVE
  DLC.MODIFY               RECEIVE.CANCEL
