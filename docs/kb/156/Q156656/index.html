The information in this article applies to:

- The Microsoft Network versions 2.0, 2.5, 2.51, 2.52, 2.6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


When you attempt to connect to MSN, The Microsoft Network, using the Internet and
MSN service type, you may receive the following error message:

  Remote Server Disconnect

CAUSE
=====

This message may appear for these reasons:

- The TCP/IP protocol bound to the Dial-Up adapter has been damaged. This most
  likely applies if you have connected successfully in the past.

- Some of the necessary components for the Internet connection are not
  installed, have been damaged, or have not been fully configured. The required
  components are in MSN version 1.3 and Microsoft Internet Explorer version 2.0
  or 3.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the appropriate method.

2. Click TCP/IP-&gt;Dial-Up Adapter.

3. Click Remove.

4. Click OK or Close until you return to Control Panel.

5. Reinstall the component. The following steps are based on Internet Explorer
  versions:

  then click OK.

d. On the desktop, double click on the MSN icon. The following message will
  appear Connection Manager requires some Components that are not installed on
  your computer. Do you want Connection Manager to install these?. Click Yes.

2. On the Install/Uninstall tab, check whether Internet Explorer version 2.0 or
  3.0 appears in the list of installed programs.

If neither version appears, follow these steps:

1. Connect to MSN (using the MSN Only service type) and then download a version
  of Internet Explorer.

2. Use the Internet Setup Wizard (Internet Explorer 2.0) or Get On the Internet
  (Internet Explorer 3.0) to configure your system again. To do so, click the
  Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to Internet
  Tools, and then click Internet Setup Wizard or Get On The Internet. Follow
  the instructions on the screen.
