The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you work with several OLE objects within the same document during a single
session of Creative Writer 2.0, the operation of the computer may slow down.
This problem can occur because an additional instance of the OLE program may be
started when you insert each new OLE object. For example, if you insert a
WordArt object and resize the object, then insert another WordArt object and
resize it, two instances of WordArt will be running.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs, in part, because Creative Writer supports an Undo feature.
Once the maximum number of Undo commands has been achieved, for each new action
performed, the oldest item in the Undo list is purged.

RESOLUTION
==========

To purge the instances of the OLE program, do one of the following:

- Save your document and close Creative Writer 2.0.

  -or-

- Save your document and open a new document.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To optimize your system for most common tasks performed with OLE, the
Kidart32.exe process can be started multiple times if more than one OLE object
(for example, WordArt) is inserted into a document. One alternative is to open
and close WordArt after each action performed on the OLE object.
