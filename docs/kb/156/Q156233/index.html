-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you are working on a client computer running Windows NT 3.51 that uses a
Cirrus Logic video adapter with the 5434 chipset, the system may stop responding
after you click on the Display icon in Control Panel. To restore the
functionality of the system, the system must be shut down and restarted.

CAUSE
=====

This is problem occurs when the client is configured to use the Accelerated
Screen Transfer driver Idis_nt.dll.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the following steps:

1. Open the Systems Management Server Administrator and go to the Site
  Properties screen.

2. Click Clients and select Proposed Properties.

3. Click Options.

4. Disable 'Install Accelerated Screen Transfer on Windows NT Clients.'

5. Click 'OK' until you have closed the Site Properties window.

6. Wait until the Site Properties changes are processed (30 minutes should be
  sufficient).

7. Run Upgrade.bat from the SMS_SHR share on a Systems Management Server logon
  server, to update the client's configuration.

The next time the Systems Management Server client script runs, the client will
be updated.

After the Windows NT client is reconfigured, you will receive the following
message:

  SMS Client Services Change Notification

  The system management services on this client have changed. You must restart
  the system for this change to take effect. The following components have been
  changed:

  Remote Control

At this point, the client will no longer stop responding after clicking the
Display icon in Control Panel.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
