The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition, 32-bit, for Windows, version 4.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Visual Basic setup program displays the error message:

  A required .DLL file, MSVCRT.DLL, was not found.

The program then terminates.

CAUSE
=====

The version of files MSVCRT40.DLL and OLEPRO32.DLL in Windows 2000, Windows NT
4.0, and Visual C++ 4.2 are wrapper DLLs that call functions in a new file,
MSVCRT.DLL. The file MSVCRT.DLL is included in Windows 2000, Windows 98, and
Windows Me, but not in Windows 95 or Visual Basic 4.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

Create the \VB\SETUPKIT\KITFIL32\SYS32 directory and copy the following files
from the \VB\SYSTEM directory of the Visual Basic distribution disks:

  FILE                     VERSION NUMBER
  --------------------------------------------
  MSVCRT40.DLL          4.00.5209 or 4.00.5270
  OLEPRO32.DLL          4.00.5208 or 4.00.5277


The versions of these files in Visual C++ 4.2, Windows 2000, and Windows NT 4.0
are forwarder DLL files that call functions in MSVCRT.DLL. If you include the
versions of MSVCRT40.DLL and OLEPRO32.DLL from Visual C++ 4.2, Windows 2000, or
Windows NT 4.0, then this error will occur because these files are looking for
MSVCRT.DLL.

The versions of MSVCRT40.DLL and OLEPRO32.DLL included with Visual Basic 4.00 do
not require MSVCRT.DLL. Your setup program should install these versions to
prevent this error.

NOTE: If your setup program still fails on a target system, delete or rename the
files, MSVCRT40.DLL and OLEPRO32.DLL on the target system. The target system has
the newer versions of these files. The setup program created using the Setup kit
is designed so that older files do not overwrite existing newer files on the
target system.

After deleting or renaming these files, your setup program should function
properly.

STATUS
======

This is a known problem that occurs when components from Windows 2000, Windows
NT 4.0 and Visual C++ 4.2 are used by the Visual Basic 4-32 Setup Kit to create
distribution disks. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To Check the Version Number of a File
-------------------------------------

1. From the Start Menu, click Explorer.

2. Find the file whose version you want to check.

3. Right-mouse click the file, and click Properties. The Properties dialog box
  displays.

4. Click the Version tab. The version number of the file is displayed.
