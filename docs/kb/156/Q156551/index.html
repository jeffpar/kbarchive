-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Visual FoxPro 5.0 added a new SYS() function that allows you to see the Rushmore
optimization level of query. This information can help you optimize your queries
in relation to their use of Rushmore.

SYS(3054) actually accepts the following three different parameters:

- 1 - to turn on reporting of filter optimization

- 11 - to turn on reporting of join optimization

- 0 - to turn off the reporting of optimization levels

MORE INFORMATION
================

To demonstrate how this function works, follow the steps below:

1. Copy the Customer.dbf and Orders.dbf files from the \Samples\Data folder to
  another folder where you can make changes to the tables. For the purpose of
  this example, copy only the .dbf files as they are the only files that you
  need. After you have copied the files, open them exclusively so you can
  remove the database container references and the Structural CDXs. When you
  open the tables, a dialog box opens stating that the Testdata.dbc could not
  be opened, click delete (you do not need the .dbc for this example). If you
  have SET SAFETY ON, you also get a dialog box stating that the Structural CDX
  file could not be found, click ignore.

2. Now you can type the following in the Command window:

        ? SYS(3054,1)
        SELECT * FROM customer WHERE customer.country = 'USA'

  The following is returned:

        Rushmore optimization level for table customer: none

3. Next, add an index tag on country field and repeat the query above:

        INDEX on country TAG country

  NOTE: Be sure to re-select the customer table first (SELECT customer) so you
  are operating on the original data. Now, you should see the following:

        Using index tag Country to rushmore optimize table customer
        Rushmore optimization level for table customer: full

4. Now, if you try the following query:

        SELECT * FROM customer WHERE customer.country = 'USA' and ;
           customer.maxordamt&gt;2000

  You see the following:

        Using index tag Country to rushmore optimize table customer
        Rushmore optimization level for table customer: partial

  Adding a tag on maxordamt makes the second query fully optimizable.

5. Next, if you join the two tables:

        SELECT * FROM customer, orders WHERE ;
           customer.cust_id = orders.cust_id

  You see the following:

        Rushmore optimization level for table customer: none
        Rushmore optimization level for table orders: none

6. Now, add tags to both tables for the cust_id field:

        SELECT customer
        INDEX ON cust_id TAG cust_id
        SELECT orders
        INDEX ON cust_id TAG cust_id

  Try the query again:

        SELECT * FROM customer, orders WHERE ;
           customer.cust_id = orders.cust_id

  You see the following:

        Rushmore optimization level for table customer: none
        Rushmore optimization level for table orders: none

  Since the query is joining the tables and not doing any filtering, this is
  correct. Since there is no filter, there is no filter optimization.

7. Next, issue the following command:

        ? SYS(3054,11)

  Try the query again and you see the following:

        Rushmore optimization level for table customer: none
        Rushmore optimization level for table orders: none
        Joining table customer and table orders using index tag Cust_id

8. Now, try this query:

     SELECT * FROM customer, orders WHERE customer.cust_id=orders.cust_id ;
        AND customer.country = 'USA' AND orders.order_amt&gt;500

  You see the following:

        Rushmore optimization level for table customer: full
        Rushmore optimization level for table orders: none
        Joining table customer and table orders using index tag Cust_id

  Since there is no tag for orders.order_amt, that filter expression cannot be
  optimized. Add a tag to orders for the order_amt field and the optimization
  for orders is full.
