-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

There are two options for restoring Microsoft Exchange Performance Monitor
objects:

- Reinstall the Microsoft Exchange Server software and reapply any Service
  Packs.

  NOTE: Use only the Reinstall option. This will replace missing files only. A
  fresh install will overwrite all files.

  -or-

- Use the Windows NT utilities, Lodctr.exe and Unlodctr.exe.

The Microsoft Exchange Server Setup program uses two utilities provided with
Windows NT to add and remove Performance monitor objects and counters. These
utilities can be run on a command prompt to add these back if for any reason
they become unavailable in the list of objects in Performance Monitor:

  Lodctr.exe - adds objects and counters.
  Unlodctr.exe - removes objects and counters.

MORE INFORMATION
================

During setup, Microsoft Exchange uses the Server.ins and other INS files to
issue commands that create the performance monitor counters for Microsoft
Exchange components. The .INS files point to *.INI files that contain
instructions for Lodctr.exe on how to create the counters. The INI files contain
pointers to *.H files (also known as symbol files) that include additional
counter information.

An example of an entry that contains a command to create the MTA objects would
be:

CreateProcessSafe:%s\bin;lodctr dsactrs.ini;180000

NOTE: Both initialization and header files have to be present for the counter
creation to be successful.

Manually Adding Counters
------------------------

The object and counter information is stored in the registry but it is too
complex to be easily entered in manually. This is why initialization files are
used. To restore missing Microsoft Exchange Server counters and objects for
Performance Monitor:

1. Identify what objects and counters are missing.

2. Identify the *.INI and *.H files that correspond to these objects. The
  following is a listing of default objects and the corresponding
  initialization file:

  NOTE: Not all objects are always installed as they depend on what components
  are chosen during setup.

  Object                             Initialization File
  ======                             ===================
  MSExchangeDS                       \exchsrvr\bin\DSACTRS.INI
  MSExchangeIMC                      \exchsrvr\bin\IMCPERF.INI
  MSExchangeIS                       \exchsrvr\bin\MDBPERF.INI
  MSExchangeIS Private               \exchsrvr\bin\MDBPERF.INI
  MSExchangeIS Public                \exchsrvr\bin\MDBPERF.INI
  MSExchangeMTA                      \exchsrvr\bin\MTAPERF.INI
  MSExchangeMTAConnections           \exchsrvr\bin\MTAPERF.INI
  MSExchangePCMTA                    \exchsrvr\msmcon\bin\XTNPERF.INI
  MSExchangeATMTA                    \exchsrvr\msmcon\bin\MACGPERF.INI
  MSExchangeMSMI                     \exchsrvr\msmcon\bin\MTPERF.INI
  MSExchangeES                       \exchsrvr\bin\MSESPERF.INI

  The following are objects specific to Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0:

  Object                            Initialization File
  ======                            ===================
  MSExchangeDB                      \exchsrvr\bin\EDBPERF.INI
  MSExchangeCCMC                    \exchsrvr\connect\ccmail\bin\ccmcperf.ini
  MSExchangeWEB                     \exchsrvr\bin\ewsperf.ini

  The object is also mapped to a 'service' name which corresponds to a registry
  entry. For all objects the service name is equal to the object name, except
  for the MSExchangeDB which maps to the EDB service.

3. All remaining counter information must be removed before attempting to
  recreate them again. From the location of the INI file run the following
  command:

  "UNLODCTR.EXE &lt;Service Name&gt;" (without the quotation marks)

Example: To clean up the MSExchangeMTA object and its counters:

  "UNLODCTR.EXE MSExchangeMTA" (without the quotation marks)

4. To add the object and counter information back, run the following command:

  "LODCTR.EXE &lt;Initialization file name&gt;" (without the quotation marks)

  Example: To add the MSExchangeMTA object and counters:

  "LODCTR.EXE MTAPERF.INI" (without the quotation marks)

  Performance Monitor needs to be restarted after using either of these
  utilities.

  NOTE: On Windows NT 4.0, the computer must be restarted after using the Lodctr
  command.
