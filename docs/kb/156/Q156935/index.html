The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Creative Writer for Windows, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you create an email package in Creative Writer 2, the program packages your
Creative Writer 2 document with a Creative Writer 2 Viewer (Mscwview.exe) so
that recipients without Creative Writer 2 can access the document.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Creative Writer 2 email package ends up as a self-extracting .exe file. When
the file is extracted, it installs the following files into the \Program
Files\Microsoft Kids\Creative Writer folder:

- mscwview.exe

- qd96.dll

- qrt96.dll

The Creative Writer Viewer is 100K in size. After you receive and double- click
the package in an email client that accepts attachments, you are alerted that
the Creative Writer Viewer will be installed with an option to deny. Once the
Viewer is installed, you can view Creative Writer 2 documents on a machine that
does not have Creative Writer 2 installed.

NOTE: Many email clients will not process an attachment that is in excess of 1
MB. Because the Creative Writer 2 Viewer is 100KB, documents larger than 924 KB
could possibly be returned.
