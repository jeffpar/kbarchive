-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a ComboBox is placed in a grid, the DisplayValue of the ComboBox appears
truncated.

CAUSE
=====

The DisplayValue is longer than the field to which the column is bound.

WORKAROUND
==========

Set the InputMask property of the Column to the length needed for the
DisplayValue.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The default InputMask used by the Column is calculated based on the field to
which the column is bound (the ControlSource).

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

This example will use the Customer table in the Visual FoxPro\SAMPLES\DATA
directory.

1. Create a new form.

2. Add the Customer table of TESTDATA to the Data Environment.

3. Add a grid to the form, and set the following properties for the grid:

     ColumnCount = 3
     RecordSource = Customer
     RowHeight = 25

4. Set the ControlSource property for Column1 of the grid to customer.cust_id.

5. Set the ControlSource property for Column3 of the grid to customer.company.

6. Add a ComboBox to Column2 of the grid and set the following properties of the
  ComboBox:

     BoundColumn = 2
     ColumnCount = 2
     ColumnWidths = 75,0
     Name = Combo1
     RowSource = customer.company, cust_id
     RowSourceType = 6 - Fields

7. Set the following properties for Column2 of the grid:

     ControlSource = customer.cust_id
     CurrentControl = Combo1
     Sparse = .F. - False

8. Save and run the form.

9. Click the down arrow for the ComboBox on one of the records. Note that the
  DisplayValue (the company field) becomes truncated (to five characters).If
  you scroll in the grid, you will notice that the DisplayValues for the other
  rows in the grid also become truncated.

To work around the problem, change the InputMask of the column to match the
length of the field you are trying to display in the ComboBox. For the example
above, set the InputMask of Column2 to:

     = REPLICATE("X", 40)
