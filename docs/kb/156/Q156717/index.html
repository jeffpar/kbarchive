SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform a Rollback of a shared file, Visual SourceSafe will cause the
shared file to branch. This article describes how to reproduce this behavior and
how to avoid it.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following procedure describes a workaround that will avoid branching a
shared file that is being rolled back:

1. Open or switch to Microsoft Visual SourceSafe.

2. Locate the file that needs to be rolled back and open its History Window.

3. Select the version to which you want to Rollback, and perform a Get Close the
  History window.

4. Using File Manager or Windows Explorer, move the file from step 3 to a
  different directory.

5. Switch to Visual SourceSafe, and check out the file that needs to be rolled
  back.

6. Using File Manager or Windows Explorer, move the file from step 3 back to its
  working directory, overwriting the checked-out file from step 5.

7. Switch to Visual SourceSafe, and check the file back in.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open or switch to Microsoft Visual SourceSafe.

2. Locate a file that has several versions in its history and share it with
  another project.

3. Open the file's History window and perform a Rollback to a previous version.
  If you are using Visual SourceSafe 5.0 or later, a dialog box appears warning
  you that the Rollback will perform a branch.

4. Note that the rolled back file is no longer shared.

  NOTE: You may need to refresh the Explorer window to see the updated glyphs.
