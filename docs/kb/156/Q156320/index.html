SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to open a form installed in a Public Folder for which you have
contributor privileges, the following error message may appear:

  The folder could not be opened. You need additional permission to perform
  this operation. See your administrator.

CAUSE
=====

The behavior is due to the design of the Public Folder permission hierarchy and
how forms are composed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, try one of the following.

1. Add the Public Folder to the Global Address List (GAL).

  a. In the Admin.exe program, select the properties for the Public Folder.

  b. On the Advanced tab, clear the "Hide from Address Book" check box.

2. Create the form as a send form instead of a post form and mail it to the
  Public Folder.

-or-

If the form has already been designed as a post form (and has not been
extended):

1. Create a new send form.

2. Copy and paste the controls from the old form to the new form.

-or-

If the form must be a post form, try one of the following two workarounds:

1. Configure, at minimum, Reviewer privileges for all accounts that will
  contribute.

2. Create a rule in the public folder that contains the folder application, to
  auto forward all items to another Public Folder that only a selected few have
  privileges to.

-or-

1. Install the folder application to an accessible folder (like a personal
  folder).

2. After starting the form from the personal folder, submit the item and drag it
  from the accessible folder to the destination Public Folder, which also
  contains the same folder application.
