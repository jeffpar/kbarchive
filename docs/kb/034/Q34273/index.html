<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Article: Q34273
Product(s): See article
Version(s): 4.00b 4.50
Operating System(s): MS-DOS
Keyword(s): ENDUSER | | mspl13_basic
Last Modified: 30-MAY-1990

The problem below was reported by a customer using QuickBASIC version
4.00b on the IBM PS/2 models 60 and 80 (which have VGA graphics) with
a monochrome monitor. (This problem probably also applies to the IBM
PS/2 model 50 with a monochrome monitor.) Another customer reported a
similar problem in QB.EXE in QuickBASIC version 4.50 and in QBX.EXE in
Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) version 7.00.
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information
here as it becomes available.

When the QB.EXE version 4.00b editor is started with the /b switch (QB
/b) on a IBM PS/2 model 60 or 80 with a monochrome monitor, it appears
to start correctly. However, when a file is OPENed, QuickBASIC ignores
the /b option and switches to color mode, causing the editor to be
hindered by visibility problems. Also, when the DOS SHELL command is
chosen from the File menu in QB.EXE, the text in MS-DOS is highlighted
and blinking.

To work around this editor visibility problem, execute the MODE BW80
or MODE 80 command in DOS before running QB /b or QBX /b.

This problem does not occur with QB.EXE version 4.00.

The customer reported the above problem on the following equipment:

   IBM PS/2 models 60 and 80, both with 70-megabyte hard disks,
   ESDI controllers, and IBM monochrome monitors (type 8503-002)

On the IBM PS/2 models 60 and 80 with the standard IBM PS/2 monochrome
monitor, programs normally give different gray scales instead of
color.

For a related article, query on the following words:

   gray and scale and VGA and PS/2

A customer has also reported a slightly different problem on an IBM
PS/2 Model 70 with VGA graphics and a monochrome monitor. An executed
program would not terminate when CTRL+BREAK was pressed and instead
hung the computer. Executing a MODE BW80 command under DOS before
running QB.EXE or QBX.EXE solved this problem.
