The following is a manual-setup procedure for C.

Manual Setup Procedure For Microsoft C (DOS only) System
Configurations:

Directory:

C:\MSC\BIN                  Executable file (*.EXE)
C:\MSC\LIB                  Library and Object modules (*.LIB, *.OBJ)
C:\MSC\INCLUDE              Include (or header) files (*.H)
C:\MSC\SRC                  Sample C programs
C:\MSC\UTILS                Utilities, such as LINK.EXE, CV.EXE ect.
C:\MSC\INIT                 Initialization files (*.INI)
C:\MSC\TEMP                 Temporary files for the C compiler only
                            No files copied into this directory

Autoexec.bat:

SET LIB=C:\MSC\LIB
SET INCLUDE=C:\MSC\INCLUDE
SET TMP=C:\MSC\TEMP
SET INIT=C:\MSC\INIT
SET PATH=C:\MSC\UTILS;C:\MSC\BIN;C:\MSC\SRC

Config.sys:

Files=20
Buffers=20
Shell=C:\Command.com /e: 1024 /p

(Note that the above use of the Shell command is typically only
supported for DOS Versions 3.20 and later.)

Files to Copy:

Copy the following files into the C:\MSC\BIN directory:

C1.EXE      C1L.EXE
C2.EXE      MOUSE.COM
C3.EXE      QCL.HLP
CL.EXE      C23.ERR
QC.EXE      QC.HLP
QCL.EXE

Copy all the INCLUDE files with .H extensions into the C:\MSC\INCLUDE
directory.

Copy the following files into the C:\MSC\UTILS directory:

LINK.EXE
M.EXE
LIB.EXE
CV.EXE
CV.HLP
Any other utilities, such as EXEMOD.EXE

Copy the following files into the C:\MSC\INIT directory:

TOOLS.INI
Any other .INI file

Copy any C sample programs provided with the compiler into the
C:\MSC\SRC directory.

Running The Library Manager -- LIB.EXE:

The following section assumes that the above configurations where
followed and the operations completed. The following section is on
libraries.

The C linker searches the C:\MSC\LIB directory to find either C
combined libraries or explicitly named libraries. The Microsoft naming
convention for combined libraries is xLIByz.LIB. x is either S, M, C,
or L for Small, Medium, Compact, or Large, respectively. y is the
language, in this case C. z is the math libraries; A, E, 7 for
Alternate, Emulation, or 87 coprocessor, respectively.

The following is an example:

MLIBCE.LIB  is the (M)edium model, (C) (E)mulation combined library

Copy the following files into the C:\MSC\LIB directory:

xLIBy.lib
sDLIBC.LIB          Depending on what is desired
mLIBC.LIB
cLIBC.LIB
lLIBC.LIB
EM.LIB or 87.LIB    Depending on what is desired, none for alt. math
xLIBFz.LIB          z is A for alternate or P for other
sLIBFz.LIB          Depending on choice above
mLIBFz.LIB
cLIBFz.LIB
lLIBFz.LIB
LIBH.LIB
GRAPHICS.LIB        ( Optional )

The following is an example of how to run the library manager:

1. At the operating system prompt, type LIB, then the name you
   want to call the library with the .LIB extension.

2. Press the ENTER key. The prompt will say OPERATIONS.

3. Enter the desired operations, such as appending stand alone .LIB
   or .OBJ files. If the number of modules is too many for one text
   line, the at sign, "@", can be used as a continuation character.

4. A list ( *.LST ) file is asked for, which is optional.

The following example demonstrates this process:

        C:\&gt; LIB name.lib
             Operations: +mod1.lib + mod2.lib + ... +modk.lib@
             Operations: +...+ modn.lib
             List File: name.lst

Name.lst contains a listing of all the functions that occur in
name.lib.

The following is an example of how to build the C Medium model,
Emulation library with graphics:

   C:\&gt; LIB mlibce.lib
   Operations: +mlibc.lib +em.lib +mlibfp.lib +libh.lib +graphics.lib
   List File: &lt;ENTER&gt;  ( pressing enter here will suppress the
                                   creation of a listing file. )

The above example can be repeated with appropriate modifications to
create the other C combined libraries.
