It is possible in compiled BASIC to push keys into the keyboard buffer
on IBM AT and PS/2 class computers using the CALL INTERRUPT statement.
(This technique will not work on IBM PC class computers.) This can
allow you to create keyboard macros, such as for training and
demonstration sequences in a program. Therefore, if you were to write
a program that required a lot of input from and interaction with a
user, you could also write a training or demonstration sequence that
would show the user what kind of input your program required, using
the method demonstrated below. This would require filling in the
required responses for the user by pushing the keystrokes into the
keyboard buffer.

This information applies to Microsoft QuickBASIC versions 4.00, 4.00b,
and 4.50 for MS-DOS; to Microsoft BASIC Compiler versions 6.00 and
6.00b for MS-DOS; and to Microsoft BASIC PDS versions 7.00 and 7.10
for MS-DOS.

The interrupt for the key push routine requires both the scan code for
the key and the ASCII value of the character to be pushed. A maximum
of 15 characters can be pushed into the keyboard buffer at one time.

The program shown below, KEYPSH.BAS, sets up a table containing all of
the scan codes for ASCII character values 32 (a space) through 126
(~), and defines the routine PUSHSTRING that will push the passed
string of characters into the keyboard buffer.

Code Example: KEYPSH.BAS
------------------------

' This program works on IBM AT and PS/2 class computers, but not on
' IBM PC class computers.
DECLARE SUB pushstring (thestring$)
REM $INCLUDE: 'qb.bi'   ' User-defined TYPEs for CALL INTERRUPT
' For BC.EXE and QBX.EXE in BASIC 7.00, use the include file 'QBX.BI'
DIM SHARED scanarray(1 TO 93) AS INTEGER
FOR i% = 1 TO 93  ' initialize scan code array
        READ scanarray(i%)
NEXT
CALL pushstring("&lt;Key Push!&gt;")
INPUT a$
PRINT a$
' Define Scan Codes for ASCII characters 32 (space) through 126 (~):

REM   {   |   }   ~
DATA 26, 43, 27, 41

SUB pushstring (thestring$)   ' pushes string into keyboard buffer
   DIM inregs AS regtype
   DIM outregs AS regtype
   stringlen = LEN(thestring$)
   IF stringlen &gt; 15 THEN stringlen = 15  ' max buffer size = 15

END SUB

To compile and link with Microsoft QuickBASIC versions 4.00, 4.00b,
and 4.50, or with Microsoft BASIC Compiler versions 6.00 and 6.00b,
perform the following:

   BC KeyPSH.bas;
   LINK KeyPSH.bas,,,BRUNxx.Lib+QB.Lib;

The "xx" in the library name is for the current version of the product
you are using (40, 41, 45, 60, or 61). For BASIC compiler 6.00 and
6.00b, use BRUNxxER.LIB (emulation math package) or BRUNxxAR.LIB
(alternate math package). For the alternate math library, you must
compile with the BC /FPa switch. If you compile with BC /O, link with
BCOMxx.LIB instead of BRUNxx.LIB.

To run this program in the QB.EXE environment, you must load the Quick
library QB.QLB as follows:

   QB /L QB.QLB

For BASIC PDS 7.00, compile and link as follows:

   BC KeyPSH.bas;
   LINK KeyPSH.bas,,,BRT70ENR.Lib+QBX.Lib;

The above example is for the math emulation, near strings, and real
mode run-time library. The other possible run-time libraries and their
corresponding compiler switches are as follows:

   Library Name   Compiler Switches    Comments
   ------------   -----------------    --------

   BRT70ENR.LIB   [default in MS-DOS]   Emulation math, near strings
   BRT70ANR.LIB   /FPa                  Alternate math, near strings
   BRT70EFR.LIB   /Fs                   Emulation math, far strings
   BRT70AFR.LIB   /FPa /Fs              Alternate math, far strings

To use stand-alone libraries, use BCL70xxx.LIB instead of BRT70xxx.LIB
and add the compiler switch BC /O.

For the QBX.EXE 7.00 environment, use QBX.QLB as follows:

   QBX /L QBX.QLB
