The CodeView Calls menu shows the current depth of function calls as
well as the line number the routine was called from and the parameters
passed. The current routine is always at the top and the routine from
which the current routine was called is directly below.

The routines in the Calls menu are first labeled 0-9, and if you are
nested more than ten levels deep, CodeView labels the next 26 calls
A-Z, for a display that can accept 36 levels of subroutine calls. If
you exceed this limit and then select the Calls menu, the CodeView
display becomes corrupted.

If the display is corrupted in this manner, the Redraw ("@") dialog
command can be used to restore the display to it's original state.

The Stack Trace dialog command (K) has the same function as the Calls
menu and correctly handles nesting of more than 36 levels deep.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with CodeView Version
2.20. This problem was corrected in Version 2.30.
