On Pages 91-92 of the "CodeView and Utilities" manual that accompanied
C 5.10 and Pascal 4.00 for CodeView Version 2.20, the period is
documented as being useful as a specifier of local variables in parent
functions. The syntax is stated to be as follows:

   routine_name.variable_name

However, this feature was not implemented in Version 2.20 of CodeView.
It was implemented in CodeView Version 2.30 (which accompanied FORTRAN
5.00).

This feature is useful in all languages, but particularly helpful in
Pascal because of the "nested-scoping" (the ability of a function to
access variables from the routine that called it) that occurs in
Pascal.

To use this feature in CodeView 2.30, you must be in either the
routine where the variable is defined or in a routine that is a child
(or grandchild, etc.) of that routine. After entering the proper
routine, any variable name can be referenced with a routine and
variable name (see example below).

program first (input, output) ;
var a: integer ;            { Available throughout the program }

    procedure second ;
    var b: integer ;        { Available in second and third }

        procedure third ;
        var c: integer ;    { Available in third }

        begin
            a := 3 ;
            b := 3 ;
            c := 3 ;
        end ;

    begin
        a := 2 ;
        b := 2 ;
        third ;
    end ;

begin
    a := 1 ;                { Cannot watch second/third variables }
    second ;
end.

When in procedure third, you can place a watch on the variables in
procedure second in the following manner:

w? second.b

This will display the variable in procedure second. This variable
cannot be displayed from the main program, however.
