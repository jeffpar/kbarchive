-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Outlook 2000 
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Outlook 2000 allows you to create a secondary contacts folder in a mailbox. You
can configure this contacts folder to be used as an e-mail Address Book, and
then configure Outlook to add new contacts to this secondary contacts folder by
default.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Outlook creates a default Contacts folder during installation. For the purposes
of this article, call this folder the primary Contacts folder. You can create
additional contacts folders. You can use these additional contacts folders (for
the purposes of this article, call these folders secondary contacts folders) to
store specific contact information.

Creating a New Contact
----------------------

The following are three methods you can use to add a new contact:

- In the Inbox, open a received e-mail message, and in either the From, To, or
  Cc box, right-click one of the addresses, and then click "Add to Contacts".

- Create a contact by clicking New Contact on the File menu (or pressing
  CTRL+SHIFT+C).

- On the Tools menu, click Address Book (or press CTRL+SHIFT+B). On the File
  menu, click New Entry, click New Contact, and then click OK.

Changing the Default Personal Address Location
----------------------------------------------

You can configure Outlook so that when you create a new contact, that contact is
added to a contacts folder that you specify, which can be the primary Contacts
folder or one of the secondary contacts folders.

To specify a default contacts folder for new contacts, on the Tools menu, click
Services, click Addressing, and then in the "Keep Personal Addresses in" list,
click the contacts folder that you want to be the default location for new
contacts.

NOTE: There may be several secondary contacts folders, but they are only visible
in the "Keep Personal Addresses in" list if they are configured to be displayed
as an e-mail Address Book. To configure a secondary contact folder to be
displayed as an e-mail Address Book, right-click the secondary contacts folder,
click Properties, click the Outlook Address Book tab, click to select the "Show
this folder as an e-mail Address Book" check box, and then click OK.

How New Contact Creation Method Affects the Folder to Which a New Contact is Added
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When a new contact item is added by right-clicking one of the addresses in either
the From, To, or Cc box of a received message, that contact is always added to
the primary Contacts folder, irrespective of the default personal address
location setting.

When a new contact is added by clicking New Contact on the File menu (or pressing
CTRL+SHIFT+C), the new contact location varies depending on which of the
following conditions existed during the creation of the contact:

- If any folder other than the secondary contacts folder that is the default
  personal address location is selected when the new contact is created, then
  the new contact is created in the primary Contacts folder.

- If the secondary contacts folder that is the default personal address
  location is selected when the new contact is created, then the new contact is
  created in that secondary contacts folder.

If a new contact is added by clicking Address Book on the Tools menu (or pressing
CTRL+SHIFT+B), clicking New Entry on the File menu, and then clicking New
Contact, the new contact is added to the contacts folder that you designated as
the default personal address location.
