-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect a multiple-server Microsoft Exchange 5.5 site to Lotus Notes
using the Microsoft Exchange Calendar Connector (Calcon), the Calcon process
quits when it attempts to do a free/busy query of the Exchange Server side, and
you may receive the following error message:

  The Calendar Connector cannot receive calendar requests from the Free Busy
  Information public folder for site /o=Organization/ou=SITENAME on server
  SERVERNAME due to MAPI error 80040110.

The following event may also be reported in the application event log:

  Event ID: 5013
  Source: MSExchangeCalCo
  Type: Error
  Description:
  The Calendar Connector cannot receive calendar requests made to the "Schedule+
  Free Busy Information - /o=Organization/ou=SITENAME" system folder on
  SERVERNAME due to MAPI error 80040110 and is shutting down.

CAUSE
=====

If there are multiple servers that are running Exchange Server 5.5 in the same
site, and if these servers require free/busy updates from Notes, Calcon can quit
if it attempts to access a server that does not have Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 2 (SP2) installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, update all servers that need access to this information
to Exchange Server 5.5 SP2 or later.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange 5.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3 (SP3) is now available. For best
performance it is recommended that all of the computers that are running
Exchange 5.5 and the Exchange Connectors that are installed on those computers
are both running the same service pack.

NOTE: A separate service pack is required for the Exchange Connectors.
