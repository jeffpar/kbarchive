SUMMARY
=======

If you install Microsoft FrontPage Server Extensions and configure them to send
mail to an Exchange Server computer that has relay restrictions enabled for the
Internet Mail Service, when you submit a form that is set to mail its results by
means of Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) you may receive the following
error message:

  FrontPage Error.
  User: please report details to this site's webmaster.
  Webmaster: please see the server's application event log for more details.

The following event is logged in the application event log of the server that is
running the FrontPage Extensions:

  Event ID: 1000
  Source: Frontpage 4.0
  Type: Warning
  Category: None

  Description:
  Microsoft FrontPage Server Extensions: http://frontpageserver - Error #160005
  Message: Bad response from SMTP host'exchangeserver': 550 Relaying is
  prohibited.

To resolve this issue, you must allow the IP address of the server that is
running the FrontPage Extensions to relay on the Internet Mail Service of the
Exchange Server computer.

To allow the IP address of the server that is running the FrontPage Extensions to
relay on the Internet Mail Service of the Exchange Server computer:

1. Click the Routing tab in the Internet Mail Service properties, and then make
  sure that Reroute incoming SMTP mail is selected.

2. On the Routing tab, click Routing Restrictions.

3. Click to select the "Hosts and Clients with these IP addresses" check box,
  and then click Add.

4. Add the IP address for the server that is running the FrontPage Extensions,
  and use 255.255.255.255 as the mask; this allows relay for this IP address
  only.

  NOTE: If FrontPage Extensions are running on the Exchange Server computer, add
  127.0.0.1 and use a mask of 255.255.255.255.

5. Restart the Internet Mail Service.
