SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a meeting request, you may receive a non-delivery report (NDR) for
a recipient who was not invited to the meeting that is similar to the
following:

  Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

  Subject:Test Message
  Sent:2/22/2000 3:40 PM

  The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

  NDR on 2/22/2000 3:40 PM
  The message was undeliverable because the recipient postal address was not
  known at this address.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the recipient of the meeting request has a damaged
delegate rule or is using a delegate rule that points to a mailbox that has been
deleted. For additional information about NDRs from attendees not listed in an
appointment, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q156525 Sched+ User Gets NDR from Attendee not Listed in Appointment

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, remove the delegate permissions:

1. On the Tools menu, click Options.

2. Click the Delegates tab.

3. Click the entry for the user who is no longer in the global address list, and
  then click Remove.

4. Click OK.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you set up delegate permissions, Outlook creates a hidden rule in the Inbox
that automatically forwards meeting requests to the delegate. When the delegate
mailbox is removed from the global address list, the delegate rule is not
automatically updated.
