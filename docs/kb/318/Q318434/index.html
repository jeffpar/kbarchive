SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to perform a silent installation of .NET Framework by
using Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Consider the following issues before you use SMS to distribute .NET Framework:

- You must obtain the redistributable components for installation. The
  Microsoft .NET Framework Redistributable package is currently available at
  the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/default.asp?url=/downloads/sample.asp?url=/msdn-files/027/001/829/msdncompositedoc.xml
  (http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/default.asp?url=/downloads/sample.asp?url=/msdn-files/027/001/829/msdncompositedoc.xml)

- You must identify a group of computers that meet the minimum requirements to
  successfully install .NET Framework. The following list describes the
  operating system requirements, the software requirements, and the server
  installation requirements:

   - Operating system requirements:

      - Microsoft Windows 98
      - Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 (Service Pack 6a [SP6a] is required)
      - Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition (Me)
      - Microsoft Windows 2000 (Service Pack 2 [SP2] is recommended)
      - Microsoft Windows XP Professional
      - Microsoft Windows XP Home Edition

   - Software requirements:

      - Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.01 or later (it is recommended that you
        install Internet Explorer 6.0)

   - Server installation requirements:

      - Microsoft Data Access Components 2.6

        NOTE: Microsoft Data Access Components 2.7 is recommended (for
        applications that use Data Access).

      - Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0

        NOTE: To access the features of Asp.net, you must install IIS with the
        latest security updates before you install .NET Framework.

Note: If you perform a typical installation, you can ignore these requirements.
If you are unsure of the type of installation that you want to perform, make
sure that you meet the typical installation requirements. For more information,
refer to documentation at the following Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) Web
site:

  http://msdn.microsoft.com

After you ensure that you meet the basic requirements, you may proceed to create
an SMS package from the .NET Framework Redistributable package. For more
information about SMS software distribution and package creation options, refer
to the SMS Online Help file.

How to Perform a Silent Installation of .NET Framework
------------------------------------------------------

To perform a silent installation of .NET Framework, run the following command:

  dotnetfx.exe /q:a /c:"install /q"

If you do not want to install .NET Framework silently, run the following
command:

  dotnetfx.exe

After you ensure that the program is set to run with administrative rights, you
can create an advertisement for the package to a collection of your choice.
