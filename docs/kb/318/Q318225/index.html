The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Windows Integrated and Kerberos authentication, you may receive the
following error message every 30 days from Internet Information Services (IIS):

  401 access denied

This problem does not occur when you only use NTLM.

CAUSE
=====

IIS caches some credential handles. These handles are removed by a scavenger if
they get too old. However, this does not occur for handles that are used to
decrypt Kerberos tickets. Because of this, if the handle ages, IIS cannot
correctly use the related Kerberos tickets.

WORKAROUND
==========

Disable the use of Kerberos for Windows Integrated authentication. For
additional information about how to disable Kerberos authentication, click the
article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q215383 How to Ensure Windows Integrated Logons in Internet Information
  Services 5.0

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest IIS cumulative security patch. For
additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Services
