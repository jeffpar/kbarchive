SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article describes how to modify the metabase to control
authentication persistence.

HTTP Keep-Alives allow Web browsers to reuse the same TCP connection to make
multiple requests to a Web server such as Internet Information Server (IIS). If
a Web server requires authentication such as Basic, Kerberos, or Microsoft
Windows NT Challenge/Response, a Web browser is challenged for authentication by
the server. The Web browser must send authentication information to the Web
server. After the Web browser is authenticated by the server, the Web browser
can only be challenged again by the server when it opens a new connection from a
different TCP port. This is known as authentication persistence.

Authentication persistence can be controlled by the metabase property
AuthPersistence. Microsoft recommends that you set this property by setting the
corresponding subflag to TRUE, which automatically sets a binary value for
AuthPersistence.

Description of Authentication Persistence Settings
--------------------------------------------------

- AuthPersistSingleRequest: If this metabase property is set to TRUE,
  authentication persists only for a single HTTP request.

- AuthPersistSingleRequestIfProxy: If this metabase property is set to TRUE,
  authentication persists only for a single HTTP request if it is a proxy
  request and the request is not handled by Microsoft Proxy Server (that is, if
  Proxy Server and IIS are running on the local computer, and the request is
  targeted to a remote server.)

- AuthPersistSingleRequestAlwaysIfProxy: If this metabase property is set to
  TRUE, authentication is valid for a single HTTP request if the request is by
  proxy.

NOTE: Only one subflag of AuthPersistence can be TRUE at one time. By default,
AuthPersistSingleRequestIfProxy is set to TRUE. The metabase entries that are
turned on by default do not appear on enumeration of the metabase until you
specifically set them.

Modify the Metabase
-------------------

WARNING: If you edit the metabase incorrectly, you can cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall any product that uses the metabase. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that problems that result if you incorrectly edit the metabase
can be solved. Edit the metabase at your own risk.

NOTE: Always back up the metabase before you edit it.

For additional information about how to back up the metabase, click the article
numbers below to view the articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q300675 HOW TO: Create a Metabase Backup by Using Internet Information Server
  4.0 in Windows NT

  Q300672 HOW TO: Create a Metabase Backup in IIS 5

To modify the metabase properties as described in this article, run the following
at a command prompt:

  CSCRIPT.EXE ADSUTIL.VBS SET W3SVC/AuthPersistSingleRequest TRUE

NOTE: Adsutil.vbs is generally located at Winnt\System32\Inetsrv\Adminsamples
(for IIS 4.0) or at Inetpub\Adminscripts (for IIS 5.0).

NOTE: Setting AuthPersistence values can cause the IIS server performance to
decrease. Based on the subflag set, the IIS server may challenge each Web
browser for each HTTP request that is made to the server. This also may require
the IIS server to make authentication requests to the domain controller for each
domain account making a new HTTP request.
