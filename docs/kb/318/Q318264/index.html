-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an executable (.exe) file calls a form that is not part of the .exe file,
and you then attempt to delete the form file, you may receive the following
error message:

  File is in use.

CAUSE
=====

The DO FORM command in the .exe file does not release the form file until the
process ends.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Visual FoxPro for
Windows 7.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q316964 How to Obtain the Latest Visual FoxPro for Windows 7.0 Service Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Visual FoxPro for
Windows 7.0.

This problem was first corrected in Visual FoxPro for Windows 7.0 Service Pack 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior:

Paste the following code in a program (.prg) file named Test, and then run the
program from the Command window:

NOTE: The code creates and runs an .exe file, that runs a form. The .exe file
then tries to delete the form file.

  SET SAFETY OFF

  *  Using VFP6 compatible code:
  set print to myexe.prg
  set print on

  \	myform = "testform1"
  \	DO FORM (myform)
  \	CLEAR ALL
  \	CLOSE ALL
  \	RELEASE ALL
  \	CLEAR ALL
  \	CLOSE ALL
  \	myform = "testform1"
  \	ERASE (myform + ".*")
  	
  set print off
  set print to

  clear typeahead
  KEYBOARD "{ctrl+W}"
  CREATE FORM testform1

  BUILD PROJECT myexe FROM myexe
  BUILD EXE myexe FROM myexe
  RUN /n myexe

Because the .exe file has not released the form file, you receive the error
message that is described in the "Symptoms" section.
