On page 400, in the last paragraph,

Change:
"For example, if your network uses a high-speed T-1 line to connect two sites,
and also a dial-up network connection as a backup in case the T-1 line is
unavailable, you would specify a lower cost for the T-1 line and a higher cost
for the dial-up network connection (even though the T-1 is more expensive to run
than the dial-up). Active Directory service always chooses the connection on a
per cost basis, using the connection with the lowest cost, as long as it is
available."

installed, which automatically creates the Default-First-Site-Name site. You
cannot create a first domain controller in any site but Default-First-Site-Name,
but you can create a domain controller in a site that has a previously existing
domain controller and then move it to another site. Therefore, after you have
installed the first domain controller, creating the Default-First-Site-Name
site, you can create other domain controllers in this site and then move them to
alternative site. You can also use this procedure to move member servers between
sites."

To:
"In general, you can install a domain controller to any site. The exception to
this rule is the first domain controller installed, which automatically creates
the Default-First-Site-Name site, and installs itself in that site. You cannot
create a first domain controller in any site but Default-First-Site-Name, but
you can create an additional domain controller in any site. If domain
controllers are installed at a central location and then shipped to a different
