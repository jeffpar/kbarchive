- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

You sometimes need to know the correct frequencies for your departure airport,
waypoint airport, and destination airport. You need this information if:

- You use the Air Traffic Control (ATC) feature but you do not use the Autotune
  feature.

  -or-

- You use the Instrument Landing System (ILS) feature.

This article explains how to find the ILS and ATC radio frequency information for
the airports.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use one of the following methods, as appropriate to your situation.

Method 1: Find Information in Flight Planner
--------------------------------------------

If you are not in flight yet, follow these steps:

1. Click Create A Flight.

2. Click Flight Planner.

3. Choose a departure airport and a destination airport.

4. Click "Find route".

5. On the Edit tab, click the airport in the Waypoint list to center the map on
  the airport.

6. Double-click the airport on the map. If the Facilities window appears, click
  the airport, and then click OK.

  The Facility Information dialog box appears. The Facility Information dialog
  box displays ILS, the air traffic control frequency, and the ground traffic
  control frequency.

7. Make a note of the details that you need, and then click OK to return to
  Flight Planner.

8. Click OK, and then click Fly Now to begin the flight. You can now set the ILS
  and radio frequency settings.

NOTE: Air traffic control in Flight Simulator may tell you to land at a different
runway from the one that you planned to land at. Make sure you have all the ILS
frequencies for your destination airport.

Method 2: Find Information While You Are in Flight
--------------------------------------------------

To find radio frequency information while you are flying, follow these steps:

1. While in flight, press the ALT key (if necessary) to display the menu bar.

2. On the World menu, click Map View.

3. Double-click the airport on the map.

4. If the Facilities window appears, click the airport, and then click OK.

  The Facility Information dialog box appears. The Facility Information dialog
  box displays ILS, the air traffic control frequency, and the ground traffic
  control frequency.

5. Make a note of the details that you need, and then click OK twice to return
  to the flight.
