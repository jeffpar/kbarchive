-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe 6.0c, used with:
   - Microsoft Visual Studio.NET (2002), Professional Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you change the binding information for a source control project that has
been branched to a newly created branched location, your local files may be
overwritten with the file version that the source code control provider stores.

CAUSE
=====

Visual Studio .NET compares the files in your local working folder to those that
your source code control provider stores. This problem occurs because Visual
Studio .NET replaces any files that are not the same as the files that the
source code control provider stores.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, make sure that you back up your local working folder
before you bind to a new location.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce the Behavior
-------------------------------

1. User 1 creates a Microsoft Visual Basic .NET project and then adds a solution
  and a project to source code control.

2. In Visual SourceSafe Explorer, someone shares and branches the project.

3. User 1 edits the solution item and then checks in the solution.

4. User 2 clicks Source Control on the File menu and then clicks "Create project
  from Source Control" to enlist to the new location.

5. User 2 makes conflicting edits to the solution item and then checks in the
  solution.

6. User 1 unbinds the solution from the original location, closes the dialog
  box, clicks Source Control on the File menu, and then clicks Change Source
  Control to rebind to the new location. User 1 receives the following error
  message:

  The following items must be modified to change the source control bindings.
  They cannot be checked out from source control, so the items' attributes will
  be overridden. You can use the Get Latest Version on the affected items to
  merge your changes. However you should check with your system administrator
  before doing so.

  Some items at the new binding have different contents on your local disk than
  in the newly bound database. You should consult your administrator. The Get
  Latest Version command may be able to resolve these issues, but you should
  exercise caution as this may cause you to lose any changes you have made.
