SUMMARY
=======

It is a good idea to limit the length of passwords for accounts that are used by
Systems Management Server (SMS) to 14 characters, even though Microsoft Windows
NT-based domain and local accounts can use very long passwords (in some cases,
up to 256 characters). Using passwords that are not longer than 14 characters is
a good idea because:

- SMS may try to encrypt the password, but SMS cannot encrypt passwords that
  are longer than 14 characters.

- The Password box in the SMS Administrator console is limited to 14
  characters.

MORE INFORMATION
================

These SMS service accounts have a 14-character limit for the password:

- The SMS Service account
- The Windows NT Client Software Installation account
- The Sender Address account
- The SMS Client Remote Installation account
- The Client Connection account
- The Site System Connection Account

You can specify passwords of up to 36 characters for the SMS service accounts
during SMS Setup. However, using more than 14 characters in a password causes
problems after the SMS components begin operations. The symptoms of these
problems may include account lockouts, SMS components that cannot access
resources, and account authorization errors.
