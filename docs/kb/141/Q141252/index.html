MORE INFORMATION
================

If the symptoms continue after you attempt to resolve the problem using the
steps listed above, perform the following steps:

1. Close the program listed at the top of this article.

2. Drag the Monotype Sorts font now located on your Desktop and drop it back
  into the Fonts folder.

  For more information about how to perform drag-and-drop operations in Windows,
  see your Windows printed documentation or online Help.

3. Move the MS Reference 1 and MS Reference 2 fonts onto your Desktop using a
  drag-and-drop operation.

4. Restart the program listed at the top of this article to test for the problem
  behavior.

If the problem still continues, try the following steps:

1. Close the program listed at the top of this article.

2. Drag the MS Reference 1 and MS Reference 2 fonts now located on your Desktop
  and drop them back into the Fonts folder.

3. Beginning with the first font listed in the Fonts folder, move five to ten
  fonts at a time to the Desktop.

4. Move each of the fonts back to the Fonts folder (one at a time).

5. To determine if the text displays correctly, test the program by starting the
  program listed at the top of this article after you move each font back to
  the Fonts folder.

6. If the program resumes erratic behavior, remove the last font you placed back
  into the Fonts folder, and delete it. If the program works properly after
  you've moved all (that is, all five to ten of the fonts that you previously
  removed from the Fonts folder) the fonts back into the Fonts folder, you'll
  need to continue testing until you find the corrupted file by repeating steps
  3-5 above with another five to ten fonts until text in the program displays
  correctly.
