The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Below is the README from the updated Hewlett-Packard (HP) PCL5EMS drivers. At
the end of the document are locations for downloading the driver set.

MORE INFORMATION
================

PCL5EMS.DLL Version 3.30
------------------------

This release adds support for the following HP Model Printers:

- HP LaserJet 5Si

- HP LaserJet 5Si MX

- HP LaserJet 5L

- HP CopyJet

- HP DeskJet 1600C

Requirements Before Installation
--------------------------------

These updated Drivers require that Service Pack 3 be installed before they will
work properly. In particular WINSRV.DLL was changed to handle large spool files
across the Lan.

The order of Installation is important. Please install in the following order:

1. Service Pack 3

2. Updated Printer Drivers.

In the event that you installed the Service Pack 3 last please do the following:

1. Select the Installed Printer from Print Manager

2. From the Printer Menu choose "Remove Printer"

3. Following the Installation steps listed in the section "Installation
  Instructions"

Known Issues:

In some cases, when printing to the HP Deskjet 1600c in 24bit color mode from 16
bit applications, the output received may not be in color. This does not occur
when printing in 8 bit (256 color) mode or the 3 bit (8 color) mode. This
problem can be worked around by printing to a lower color mode setting or, if
possible, printing from a 32 bit version of the application.

HP 5SI/5SI MX Bin Mapping
-------------------------

The following is a list of how the naming of media sources in Microsoft's printer
driver compares to the naming of media sources in HP's printer driver for the HP
LaserJet 5Si and HP LaserJet 5Si MX printers:

  HP's Driver           Microsoft's Driver
  -------------------------------------------------------
  Tray 1                MP Tray
  Tray 2                Upper Tray
  Tray 3                Lower Tray
  Manual Feed(Tray 1)   Manual Feed/ Envelope Manual Feed
  Envelope Feeder       Envelope
  Tray 4                Large Capacity
  Automatic             Auto Select

  the downloading procedure, or type the path of the directory where you
