Driver Source and Files Needed to Play Sound and Video
------------------------------------------------------

Most programs playing digitized Wave (.wav) sounds, including Windows
Media Player, require MCIWAVE. MSACM is required when playing
compressed Wave, along with the appropriate codec
(compressor/decompressor).

NOTE: Some sound cards support ADPCM compression directly, and do not
require MSACM.

Video for Windows (VFW) is required when playing videos, and an
appropriate codec if the videos are compressed. Generally, videos are
always compressed. The sound in most video clips is uncompressed.

MMP or MCIMMP (.mmm files) are used when playing animations(.mmm)
files. MMP is required by Media Player. Other programs do not use MMP,
but use MCIMMP instead.

Microsoft Multimedia programs that require special files or drivers not
normally included with Windows usually include these driver files on
the program compact disc. For example, Video for Windows is not included
with Windows 3.x. To allow program functionality, the necessary
support files are included in the runtime version of Video for
Windows supplied on the multimedia program's compact disc.

If newer versions of these same drivers are installed on your
computer, the Multimedia application's Setup program does not replace,
or overwrite the file. If you install Bookshelf 1994, the Setup
program installs MSACM 2.0. If you then install Encarta 1994 (includes
MSACM 1.0), Encarta's Setup program does not install the older MSACM
1.0 files.

NOTE: Windows 95 is the first version of Windows to include Video for
Windows and MSACM. Windows 95 includes 32-bit Codecs for all the
formats listed above, and is compatible with 16-bit Codecs as well.
For this reason, Windows 95 programs do not include these drivers on
their own compact disc.

CAUTION: Do not attempt to install or copy older Video for Windows or
MSACM system files onto a Windows 95/98 based-computer.
