SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Exchange in Windows 95 to access any shared-file-
system-based (SFS) post office, shared folders on the post office are not
available.

Examples of SFS post offices include the post offices created by Microsoft
Windows for Workgroups 3.x, Windows 95, and Microsoft Mail3.x.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Exchange client in Windows 95 does not provide the ability to view
shared folders on an SFS post office.

RESOLUTION
==========

To view shared folders in Microsoft Exchange in Windows 95, perform the
following steps:

1. Download the Exupdusa.exe file from the Microsoft Software Library to an
  empty folder.

  NOTE: If you copy the file to your Windows\Desktop folder, be sure you delete
  the following files from the Windows\Desktop folder after Exupdusa.exe is
  installed: Exchgupg.inf, Exchng32.exe, Readme.txt, Mapi.dll, Mapi32.dll,
  Msfs32.dll, Wgpoadmn.dll, and Wmsui32.dll.

2. In My Computer or Windows Explorer, double-click the Exupdusa.exe file you
  downloaded in step 1.

3. Double-click the Readme.txt file for installation instructions.

  NOTE: The Windows 95 Shared Folders Update Readme.txt file is also available
  in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
