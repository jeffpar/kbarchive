The information in this article applies to:

- The Microsoft Network versions 1.0, 1.05, 1.2, 1.3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article lists known issues concerning the Find feature on MSN, The
Microsoft Network.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Service Properties Not Available in Find Window
-----------------------------------------------

The Properties command is not available for services you locate using Find. To
work around this problem, select a service and then click Open Containing Folder
on the File menu to go to the folder containing the service. You can view
properties in the folder containing the service.


Containing Folder May Be in Different Language
----------------------------------------------

When you use the Open Containing Folder command to open the folder in which a
found service resides, the folder may be part of a language tree different from
the language you are using. This can happen because the same service may reside
in more than one language tree.


Saved Search Does Not Save Information Type Settings
----------------------------------------------------

When you save a search, the check box settings for the type of information to
search for are not saved. When you open the saved search, the default settings
of Name and Topic, Place And People are selected.


Key Combination for Stop Search Does Not Work on First Attempt
--------------------------------------------------------------

The key combination ALT+P to stop a search does not work on the first attempt. If
you press ALT+P a second time, it does stop the search.


Windows Explorer May Not Open for Multiple Selected Services
------------------------------------------------------------

If you select more than one service in the Find window and then click Explore on
the File menu, Windows Explorer may not open for all the selected services.


Download-and-Run Files Not Listed in Of Type Box
------------------------------------------------

In the Find dialog box on MSN, the Of Type box does not contain an option for
download-and-run files. The option Kiosks And Other Files includes
download-and-run files.


Slow Search When Many People Use Find Feature
---------------------------------------------

If a search is very slow, it is probably because many people are conducting
searches at the same time.


Selecting New Search Does Not Reactivate Disabled Containing Box
----------------------------------------------------------------

If you disable all three information types (Name; Topic, Place And People; and
Description), the Containing box is also disabled. If you then click New Search,
the Name and Topic, Place And People information types are enabled, but the
Containing box is not. You can enable the Containing box by clicking the
Description check box.


Limited Use of Wildcard Characters
----------------------------------

If you use three or more wildcard characters when using Find, the following
incorrect message may appear:

  Find on The Microsoft Network.
  This service is not available at this time. Please try again later.


Additional query words: 1.2 msn
