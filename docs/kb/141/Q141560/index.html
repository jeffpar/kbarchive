SYMPTOMS
========


When you print from Creative Writer in Windows 95, the screen changes colors
(re-palettizes) after the snake finishes moving across the screen (the snake
signals the progress of the print job).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use an emulation printer driver for your printer.

For example, if you are using the Canon BubbleJet 600, use the Epson LQ 860 or
Epson LQ 2550 printer driver.

Installing A New Printer in Windows 95
--------------------------------------

1. Click the Start Button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Double-click Add Printer.

3. The Add Printer Wizard will start. Follow the on-screen instructions to
  install your printer.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q130255 Windows 95: Installing or Setting a Default Printer Driver


If this does not resolve the problem, follow standard troubleshooting steps to
minimize the amount of memory used when printing.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It appears that the Canon printer driver uses a lot of memory and can cause
video corruption in Creative Writer (and possibly Fine Artist). The Epson
printer driver does not require as much memory to print.

The colors in other programs running at the same time look fine. Switching from
Creative Writer to another application and back again (to force the screen to
redraw) does not resolve the problem.
