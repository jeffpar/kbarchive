SYMPTOMS
========

Under User Properties in User Manager for Domains, it is possible to set User
Must Change Password at Next Logon and User Cannot Change Password checked at
the same time. Thus, the user will be prompted to change his password but then
will get the error message:

  Unable to change the password on this account.
  Please consult your system administrator.

CAUSE
=====

In User Manager for Domains under Policies/Account if the Maximum Password Age
expires and User Cannot Change Password is checked, you will see these boxes
checked at the same time, User Must change Password at Next Logon and User
Cannot Change Password. Since these options exclude each other it should not be
possible for both of them to be selected.

WORKAROUND
==========

Have the administrator go into User Manager for Domains; Policies - Account and
set the Maximum Password Age to Password Never Expires, then the user should be
able to change the password. Or have the administrator change the password.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT Workstation and
Server versions 3.5, 3.51, and 4.0. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.
