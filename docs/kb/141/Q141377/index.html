SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT provides two utilities that allow you to modify the configuration and
registration databases. The two utilities are Regedit.exe and Regedt32.exe. This
article describes the differences between the two utilities.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Regedit.exe
-----------

Regedit.exe is the registration editor for 16-bit Windows, which is used to
modify the Windows registration database. The database is located in the Windows
directory as REG.DAT. The database contains information about 16- bit
applications, and is used by File Manager for opening and printing files. It is
also used by applications that support Object Linking and Embedding (OLE).
REG.DAT is used and maintained by Windows on Windows (WOW) and 16-bit Windows
applications. The WOW layer resides on top of the Virtual DOS Machine (VDM).

Regedit.exe is a 16-bit application that is included in Windows NT for
compatibility with previous 16-bit applications. Regedit provides a method for
examining REG.DAT under Windows NT. You can migrate the REG.DAT database file to
the Windows NT registry during the first logon to an initial installation of
Windows NT.

Regedt32.exe
------------

Regedt32.exe is the configuration editor for Windows NT, which is used to modify
the Windows NT configuration database, also known as the Windows NT Registry.
This editor allows you to view or modify the Windows NT Registry. The editor
provides views of windows that represent sections of the registry, called hives.
Each window displays two sections. On the left side, there are folders that
represent registry keys. On the right side, there are the values associated with
the selected registry key. Regedt32 is a powerful tool, which you must use with
extreme caution when changing registry values. Missing or incorrect values in
the registry can render the Windows NT installation unusable.

For additional information on Regedit and Regedt32, please see the on-line Help
for these utilities or the Resource Kit Tools Overview Help in the Windows NT
Resource Kit.
