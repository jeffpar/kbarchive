SUMMARY
=======

The DAOTable sample (Daotbl.exe) demonstrates how to use the MFC DAO classes to
create the following common database objects: databases, tables, queries,
fields, and indexes. This dialog-based application maps the properties of these
objects to controls the user can set or view. The program source code is
organized so that most database interaction is isolated from the user interface
code to ease finding examples of how to use MFC DAO.

In addition to demonstrating the use of the MFC DAO classes, this sample can be a
useful tool for creating simple Microsoft Access databases. You can create .mdb
files from scratch, create and delete tables and queries, add and delete fields
and indexes in the tables, and modify existing queries.

The following files contain the code that performs the database operations.
Additional files in the project provide the user interface and high level
database manipulation.

  QUERYDEF.CPP, .H -- functions to create and use queries
  TABLEDEF.CPP, .H -- functions to create and use tables
  FIELD.CPP, .H    -- functions to create and use fields
  INDEX.CPP, .H    -- functions to create and use indexes
  DATABASE.CPP, .H -- functions to create and use databases

To use this code and the MFC DAO classes, you must have Visual C++ 4.0 or later.

NOTE: Beginning with Visual C++ 4.1, the DAOTable sample is included with the
Visual C++ CD.

Special Note for Visual C++ 4.1 Users
-------------------------------------

The DAOTABLE sample that shipped with Visual C++ 4.1 contains a bug that will
prevent you from creating fields that are of any type other than text. To
correct this problem, you can download the fixed sample as directed below or
make the following correction to the ADDTBDLG.CPP file:

Replace this line

     m_FI.m_bAllowZeroLength = TRUE;

with this line:

     m_FI.m_bAllowZeroLength = FALSE;

This change will disable a workaround that was necessary to avoid a bug in Visual
C++ 4.0. In the download files (DAOTBL.EXE), the workaround code is
conditionally compiled depending on which version you are using to build the
sample. If you do not make the correction given in this section and you run the
application using the Visual C++ 4.1 DLLs, the following exception will be
thrown when you try to create nontext fields:

  Couldn't create field--Exception: Invalid Operation.

NOTE: The file must be decompressed by typing "DAOTBL.EXE -d" to re-create the
directory structure.

The MFC DAO classes provide a way to directly use the Microsoft Jet Database
Engine. Although Visual C++ wizards automatically generate code that will create
and open recordsets for you based on implicitly created database and workspace
objects, the code they provide does not demonstrate creating and manipulating
MFC DAO objects directly. With MFC DAO classes, you can create the majority of
DAO objects and set their properties.

This sample demonstrates using the MFC DAO classes to create and use the
following DAO objects: databases, tables, queries, fields, and indexes.
Exception handling with both MFC exception macros and the C++ exception
mechanism is also shown. Further, DAO exceptions are put to use in detecting the
existence of objects in the DAO collections.

Listed below are all the files in the project (except those that are common to
all Visual C++ projects). Each file is shown with the type of components it
contains and a brief description.
