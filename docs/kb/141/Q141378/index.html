SYMPTOMS
========

When booting into Windows NT configured with a Xircom Credit Card Ethernet
Adapter model PS-CE2-10, various difficulties may be encountered. An error
message indicating that adapter driver could not be loaded may or may not
appear. Even if no such warning is encountered, access to the network may not be
possible. Another possible symptom is the ability to access the network, but at
a very slow speed.

One additional symptom that has been observed is that Windows NT will function
flawlessly with the Xircom adapter if the adapter was first initialized by
another operating system such as Windows For Workgroups and the system then is
warm booted into Windows NT.

CAUSE
=====

According to NEC technical support, the Xircom adapter needs to configured to
IRQ 5 on the Versa P in order to function with Windows NT. The difficulty arises
from the fact that the built in sound adapter is also configured to IRQ 5 and
cannot be changed.

RESOLUTION
==========

The latest revision of the BIOS for the NEC Versa P models at the time of this
writing is 1.02.15. This version of the BIOS allows the IRQ for the built in
sound adapter to be configured to an IRQ other than IRQ 5.

Since the NEC Versa P employs Flash BIOS, the BIOS may be upgraded by simply
downloading the current BIOS from NEC.
