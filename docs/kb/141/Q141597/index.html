-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Setup disk for the Sound Blaster AWE32 sound card, you may
receive the following error message:

  We've encountered an error as follows:
  On script line 184 we had a problem:
  Unable to create directory C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\&lt;filename&gt;
  Continue installing? "Y" or "N"

where &lt;filename&gt; is Sb16snd.drv, Cspman.dll, or Sbawe32.drv.

When you receive this error message, you also receive a series of error messages,
including general protection (GP) fault error messages.

After upgrading to Windows 95, you may receive the following error message:

  Systray - Error loading program

CAUSE
=====

The Windows 95 drivers for the AWE32 sound card were loaded and in use when you
tried to run the Setup disk. Some of the drivers were replaced by Windows 3.x
drivers from the Setup disk.

In the case of the "Systray" error while upgrading to Windows 95, Setup failed to
upgrade drivers for Creative Labs Sound Blaster 16 or AWE 32.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the AWE32 sound card in Device Manager and then use the Add New Hardware
tool in Control Panel to redetect the sound card.

NOTE: It may also be necessary to disable lines in the System.ini file that
reference the following files before you can redetect the sound card:

  Sb16aux.drv
  Sb16snd.drv
  Sbawe32.drv

To disable these lines, open the System.ini file in any text editor (such as
Notepad), and place a semicolon (;) at the beginning of each line you want to
disable. After you disable the lines, save the System.ini file and restart
Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you receive the error messages described above, you receive the following
error message when you restart your computer:

  Sound Blaster AWE32 MIDI Synth VSBPD.386 not installed

When Windows 95 starts, you see a blank desktop. Running a program restores the
desktop. Windows 95 seems to work correctly, but trying to use any audio
component results in GP fault error messages such as:

  MSGSRV32 caused a general protection fault in MMSYSTEM.DLL
  RUNDLL32 caused a general protection fault in SB16AUX.DRV
  MMTASK caused a segment not present fault in CSPMAN.DLL
  SYSTRAY caused a general protection fault in SB16AUX.DRV

Shutting down and restarting the computer results in the following error
message:

  System File Error - The following system files have been replaced with older
  versions:

  cspman.dll, sb16snd.drv, msmixmgr.dll

This is followed by a blank desktop and GP faults as described above.
