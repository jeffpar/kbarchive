The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When the following Dr. Watson application error occurs, make sure that the
Windows NT symbols are loaded for debug operation.

Dr. Watson Application Error:

  An application error has occurred and an application error log is being
  generated.

  DRWTSN32.exe
  Exception: access violation &lt;Hex value&gt;, Address: &lt;Hex address&gt;

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the debug information in the Dr. Watson log displays "no symbols," then the
symbol tree from the Windows NT compact disc has not been loaded to the
%SystemRoot% directory. In this case, the interpretation of the Dr. Watson log
is going to be difficult.

If you want to interpret the Dr. Watson log, load the Windows NT symbols to your
%SystemRoot% directory. To load the symbol tree:

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

1. Run Expndsym.cmd from the \Support\Debug directory at a command prompt by
  typing the following command:

  "Expndsym F: C:\Winnt" (without the quotation marks)

  where F is the CD-ROM drive and \WINNT is the %SystemRoot% folder where
  Windows NT is installed.

  This will create a C:\%SystemRoot%\SYMBOLS directory structure and place the
  *.DBG files in the appropriate sub-directory (Dll, Exe, etc.)

2. Symbols must also be installed for any Service Packs and hotfixes. Follow the
  appropriate step below for the Service Pack currently installed on the
  system.

  Service Pack on CD-ROM:

  Use Explorer or a command prompt to copy the Symbols directory and its
  contents from the CD-ROM \Support\Debug\&lt;platform&gt; directory, where
  &lt;platform&gt; is one of the following: I386, Alpha, MIPS, PPC, to the
  %SystemRoot% directory. For example, to copy the symbols for the Intel
  platform, type the following command:

  "Xcopy E:\Support\Debug\I386\Symbols\*.* C:\Winnt\Symbols /S" (without the
  quotation marks)

  Service Pack from Internet:

  If you downloaded the Service Pack from the FTP or WWW site, you will also
  need to download the symbol files and follow the appropriate step below for
  the Service Pack currently installed on your system:

  SP1 or SP2: Type the following command at a command prompt:

  "Sym_400i.exe -d C:\Winnt\Symbols" (without the quotation marks)

  SP3: Type the following at a command prompt and enter the path to the Symbols
  directory (i.e., C:\Winnt\Symbols) when prompted.

  "Nt4sym3i.exe" (without the quotation marks)

  SP4: Double-click the downloaded file (Sp4symi.exe). When you are prompted for
  a path, type the path for the system root folder (usually C:\Winnt). This
  updates the already created Symbols folder (created during the install ation
  of the base product symbols). It also creates a Joyport folder in the system
  root folder.

  SP5: Service Pack 5 symbols can be downloaded from

  http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/nts/downloads/recommended/sp5/debug/default.asp

  SP6a: Service Pack 6a symbols can be downloaded from

  http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/nts/downloads/recommended/SP6/debug/default.asp

Windows NT 3.51
---------------

1. Locate the \Support\Debug\&lt;platform&gt;\symbols directory on the Windows
  NT compact disc. The &lt;platform&gt; is one of the following: i386, ALPHA,
  MIPS or PPC.

2. Copy the Symbols directory and its contents to the %SystemRoot% directory.

3. If you have a Service Pack installed, copy the contents of the Service Pack
  Symbols directory to the %SystemRoot%\Symbols directory.

Windows NT 4.0, Enterprise Edition
----------------------------------

Follow the same steps as for Windows NT 4.0, with the exception that the
Expndsym.cmd file is located on the second CD-ROM set in the Support\NTS\Debug
folder.

Windows 2000
------------

Install the Windows 2000 symbols from the Windows 2000 Customer Support and
Diagnostics Tools CD-ROM:

1. Click "Install Symbols" from the menu on the right.

2. In the "Install Symbols" section, click the appropriate type of symbols to
  install. Typically, this is the "Retail Symbols" selection.

3. Click "Install Retail Symbols". The File Download window appears.

4. Click "Run this program from the current location", and then click OK.

5. Click Yes if you receive a prompt in the form of a Security Warning dialog
  box.

6. Click Yes in the License dialog box.

7. Click OK in the "Microsoft Windows 2000 Symbols" dialog box. Ensure that the
  path is the correct path to your installation. The default is
  C:\Winnt\Symbols.

8. Click Yes to create the folder. You see the File Copy Progress dialog box.

9. Click OK in the "Installation is complete" dialog box.

NOTE: Symbolsx.exe is the installation program for the Windows 2000 symbols. It
is located in the D:\Symbols\I386\Retail folder for retail symbols or the
D:\Symbols\I386\Debug folder for the debug version of Windows 2000.
