-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Creative Writer for the Macintosh, versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.1a, 1.1c 
- Apple Macintosh System Software 7.1.2 and later 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running Creative Writer on a Macintosh with Apple Macintosh System
Software version 7.1.2 or later, and you attempt to drag a file from the Library
wall to the Portfolio Rack, the drive on which you are attempting to copy the
file is not highlighted. As a result, the file cannot be copied to the desired
drive.

To place your files on a disk, you should save them directly to the disk, rather
than use the Library.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the following steps to save files directly to a disk from within Creative
Writer for the Macintosh:

1. In Creative Writer, open the file that you want to save to another disk.

2. Press "SHIFT+COMMAND+A" (without the quotation marks) to go to the Control
  Room. Click OK.

3. On the File menu, click Save As.

4. Choose a name for your document and use the standard Macintosh list box to
  navigate to the desired disk.

5. Click Save.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem does not occur in System 7.1 or earlier, and it does not occur with
Fine Artist.
