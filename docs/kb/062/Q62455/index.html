Product(s): See article
Version(s): 4.50

Within the QB.EXE or QBX.EXE programming environment, if you create a
variable of any type and then position the cursor on the variable and
press F1, the Help window will appear, showing the type of the
variable and how it is used in the program. If you then change the
type of the variable and request help on the variable again, it will
now be shown as being defined as both types, even though the variable
appears in your program only once.

This information applies to QB.EXE for QuickBASIC version 4.50 for
MS-DOS, and QBX.EXE for Microsoft BASIC Professional Development
System (PDS) versions 7.00 and 7.10 for MS-DOS.

Although the variable appears in the Help window as being defined as
two variable types, memory is only allocated for the variable of the
type it was last declared as. The symbol table used for displaying
help on variables is updated only when QB.EXE or QBX.EXE is returned
to the root state, which is when a new program is loaded or the
current program is saved. To eliminate the duplicate entries, save the
current program by pressing ALT+F, then "S" for Save or "A" for Save
As. (The program does not need to be reloaded.)

The following steps duplicate the problem:

1. Load QB.EXE or QBX.EXE and type the following on a separate line:

     x$ = ""

2. Place the cursor on the "x$" and press F1 to get help on the
   variable.

3. With Help visible, change the line to read:

      x = 0

4. Place the cursor on the "x" and press F1 to get help on the
   variable.

You will now see the following in the Help window:

   x is a symbol that is used in your program as follows:

    | D:\TEST.BAS -----------------------
    | variable of type: STRING
    | variable of type: SINGLE precision
