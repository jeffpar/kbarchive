If you set a mark in a file, and that location then moves upward or
toward the left in the file, PWB does not reset the mark location;
however, it does correctly update marks that move downward or to the
right in the file.

Consider the following file:

/* Test.dat */
test1

test2

test3

Place the cursor on the "2" in test2. Choose the Search.Define Mark
menu option. Name the mark "mark1" and press ENTER. Now, move the
cursor to another location in the file. Choose the Search.Go To Mark
option from the menus. Go to "mark1". Note that the cursor is back on
the "2" in test2.

Next, add another blank line between test1 and test2. Again, move your
cursor and go to mark1. Note that the cursor is back on the "2" in
test2.

Now, delete both the lines between test1 and test2. Select the
Search.Go To Mark option from the menus. Note that the cursor is on
the same location as it was before you deleted these lines. The same
behavior will happen if you delete any of the characters before the
"2" in the test2 line.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Programmer's
WorkBench (PWB) version 1.00. We are researching this problem and will
post new information here as it becomes available.
