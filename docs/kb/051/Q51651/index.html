Creating formatted listings to include page breaks and page headers is
not possible within the Quick Assembler environment.

It might appear that this could be done because within the Quick
Assembler environment, you can choose to have a listing created and
then view that listing after it has been created.

It then follows that this listing would be of the same format as the
one that can be created from the command line (using QCL). However,
this is not the case. The listings that are created within the
environment do not contain either page headers or page breaks.

If you want to put page breaks in the document, a comment can
be entered as follows:

   ; [ALT 12]

This will put the formfeed character into the document and cause the
listing to page forward when it is printed.
