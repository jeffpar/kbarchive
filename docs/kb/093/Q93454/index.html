The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following information was taken from the Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
version 3.1 SETUP.TXT file. This article contains the first half of the file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This file contains information about problems that may occur while
running Windows for Workgroups Setup and describes problems that can
occur when using terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs or drivers
with Windows for Workgroups or Setup. If you are using a TSR or if you
encounter problems setting up Windows for Workgroups, read this
document BEFORE running Setup again.

General Setup Notes
====================

This section includes notes on specific system configurations that may
prevent Setup from installing Windows for Workgroups successfully. A
solution to each problem is provided.

If you are using a hardware or software product listed here, follow
the proposed recommendations before running Setup.

Network Cards
-------------

If you are using one of the following network cards, you must run
Setup with the /i option:

  Novell/Anthem NE1500
  Novell/Anthem NE2100
  Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) AM2100
  Microdyne EXOS 105

At the command prompt, type the following:

  setup /i

MS-DOS Screen Savers
--------------------

If you are using an MS-DOS screen saver, you should turn it off before
running Setup. These screen savers can cause problems when running
Setup.

COMPAQ Computer with MS-DOS Version 5.0 and EGA or VGA
------------------------------------------------------

If you are using the upgrade version of Microsoft MS-DOS 5.0, check
your CONFIG.SYS file to make sure the following drivers (if present)
appear in this order:

  HIMEM.SYS
  EMM386.EXE
  ANSI.SYS

Note: If you are using the COMPAQ version of MS-DOS 5.0, HIMEM.EXE is
used in place of HIMEM.SYS and CEMM.EXE is used in place of
EMM386.EXE.

If ANSI.SYS is loaded before HIMEM.SYS or EMM386.EXE (or if you are
using COMPAQ MS-DOS 5.0 before HIMEM.EXE or CEMM.EXE), Setup may
restart your system before Windows for Workgroups is installed. Also,
if you are using the DOS=HIGH,UMB command line to load MS-DOS into
upper memory, loading EMM386.EXE (or CEMM.EXE) before loading ANSI.SYS
will create the maximum amount of upper memory space on a COMPAQ
computer.

AT&amp;T Safari Computer
--------------------

If you have an AT&amp;T Safari computer, you cannot maintain two versions
of Windows (version 3.0 and version 3.1) on your system. You must
upgrade over version 3.0. If you set up Windows for Workgroups version
3.1 in its own directory, it will not use the special drivers required
to run on the Safari computer.

Displays That May Require Driver Updates with Windows for Workgroups
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Certain third-party display drivers designed for Windows version 3.0
can cause problems with Windows for Workgroups version 3.1. The most
serious problem is a system failure while running Windows for
Workgroups Setup. If you encounter this problem, run Custom Setup, and
then select one of the standard display types, such as VGA, that is
provided with Windows for Workgroups.

With other Windows version 3.0 display drivers, Windows for Workgroups
may be set up successfully but TrueType fonts may not appear correctly
on your screen.

An updated driver may be available from your display vendor or 
manufacturer. 

Windows version 3.0 drivers for the following display adapters may
cause problems:

- ATI Graphics Ultra and Vantage

  Note: These adapters are 8514/a-compatible and run well with the
  8514/a driver provided with Windows for Workgroups.

- DGIS display adapters (Direct Graphics Interface Standard)
  from Graphic Software Systems, including the following:

     NEC MultiSynch Graphics Engine (MGE)
     Zenith Z-649
     HP IGC-10, IGC-20
     GSS 1000 Series

  Note: Some DGIS-based adapters are TIGA-compatible and run well when
  used with the appropriate TIGACD.EXE MS-DOS driver and with the TIGA
  driver provided with Windows for Workgroups.

- HP Ultra VGA (versions earlier than 1.4 only)

- IBM Image Adapter/A

- Matrox MG Series/M-WIN Series

- Palettized VGA 640x480, 16-color (provided with Windows Multimedia
  Extensions version 1.0)

- Radius SVGA MultiView

- RGDI (Renaissance Graphics Device Interface) display adapters from
  Appian, Inc., including the following:

     Appian Rendition II, IIe, II/XE, and III
     Appian GV1024
     Decpc 433

- S3 adapters, including the following:

     Orchid Fahrenheit 1280
     STB WIND/X
     Diamond Stealth VRAM

Using Stacker
-------------

If you are using Stacker to compress your hard disk, there are certain
steps you need to take before setting up Windows for Workgroups.

- If you want to use a swap file with Windows for Workgroups, you
  must set up the swap file on the uncompressed drive. When setting
  up Stacker, you can leave at least 1 megabyte (MB) of disk space
  uncompressed for storing system files. To leave enough space for
  the swap file, it is recommended that the amount of uncompressed
  disk space equal at least twice the amount of system memory. For
  example, if your system has 4 MB of memory, you should leave at
  least 8 MB of disk space uncompressed.

  If Stacker is already set up on your system and there is not enough
  uncompressed disk space for a swap file, you can run the STAC
  utility provided with Stacker to increase the amount of
  uncompressed disk space. For more information, see your Stacker
  documentation.

- If you are using Stacker version 2.0 or later, Windows for
  Workgroups Setup modifies your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.
  When Setup finishes making the modifications, it displays a message
  at the end of the Windows portion of Setup, notifying you of the
  modifications. If you have used Stacker to swap your startup drive,
  when you restart your system, Stacker will ask whether you want to
  update to the new version of the CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
  It is recommended that you update.

  If you are using a version of Stacker earlier than 2.0, you may
  need to modify your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files yourself. For
  more information, see the following topic, "Modifying Your
  CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT Files Yourself."

- For best performance, do not use SMARTDrive to cache the compressed
  drive. You only need to cache the uncompressed drive. You can
  include options on the SMARTDRV.EXE line of the CONFIG.SYS file to
  specify which drives to cache.

  For example, if the Stacker swap utility swaps drives C and D so
  that C is compressed and D is uncompressed, you would include the
  following line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

     c:\windows\smartdrv.exe c- d+

For more information about swap files and using SMARTDrive, see
Chapter 11, "Managing Memory and Performance," in the "Microsoft
Windows for Workgroups User's Guide."

Modifying Your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT Files Yourself
---------------------------------------------------------

When you set up Windows for Workgroups, Setup usually places the
HIMEM.SYS, SMARTDRV.EXE, and EMM386.EXE files in the Windows
directory. If the Windows directory is on a disk that is not available
when you start your computer, such as a removable or nonlocal disk, or
if Setup detects one of the following conditions, Setup does not
modify the CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

- Your boot drive has been modified by a disk-compression
  utility.

- Your CONFIG.SYS file contains references to block device
  drivers.

- There is not enough available space on your hard disk to
  copy the files.

- The files are already installed on your system and Setup
  cannot overwrite them (they are read-only).

Instead, Setup writes proposed changes to the CONFIG.WIN and
AUTOEXEC.WIN or the CONFIG.00x and AUTOEXEC.00x files. In this case,
you must either move the HIMEM.SYS, SMARTDRV.EXE, and EMM386.EXE files
to a drive that is available when you start your computer, or use a
text editor to modify your CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file so that any
references to HIMEM.SYS, SMARTDRV.EXE, and EMM386.EXE appear after the
device= command line used to load the drivers for your disk drives.
Refer to the CONFIG.WIN and AUTOEXEC.WIN or the CONFIG.00x and
AUTOEXEC.00x files for the proposed changes.

Setting Up XGA on a PS/2 Model 75 or 90
---------------------------------------

If you have a PS/2 model 75 or 90 with an XGA, Windows for Workgroups
Setup will configure the display adapter for 16-color, 640x480
resolution. Do not change this configuration during Setup. Specifying
a different XGA configuration while setting up Windows for may cause
Setup to fail.

After you have successfully installed Windows, you can configure your
XGA to use a different resolution or 256 colors, if your monitor
supports it. For more information on how to do this, see the topic
"IBM XGA: Configuring Color and Resolution" in the README.WRI online
document.

If you are using the plasma screen on the PS/2 model 75, use ONLY the
640x480, 16-color configuration. If you change this configuration, you
return to the MS-DOS prompt when you try to start Windows.

Correcting the "Out of Environment Space" Error Message
-------------------------------------------------------

If you receive an "out of environment space" message when starting
Windows, you can either:

- Increase the size of your environment by adding the SHELL= command
  line to your CONFIG.SYS file. See your MS-DOS documentation for
  more information about the SHELL command and about modifying your
  CONFIG.SYS file.

- Move the SET commands in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to the beginning of
  the file so that they run before the commands that load
  terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs or drivers, such as
  SMARTDrive.

Using Terminate-and-Stay-Resident (TSR) Programs and Drivers
with Windows for Workgroups
=============================================================

The "Program Listing" section of this document lists several
terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs and drivers that are known
to cause problems when running with Windows for Workgroups. Some of
the problems you may encounter include system failures or an incorrect
display of information on your screen. In some cases, special steps
are provided to solve the problems.

While setting up Windows for Workgroups, Setup searches the
AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files for references to TSR programs and
drivers, in addition to scanning memory for TSRs that are currently
running. If Setup detects a TSR that is known to cause problems when
running with Windows for Workgroups, a message appears, asking whether
you want to continue or quit Setup.

If you receive such a message, do the following:

1. Locate your TSR in the "Program Listing" section of this document
  and use the information to determine if the situation encountered
  prevents Setup from successfully installing Windows for Workgroups.

2. If the situation does not affect Setup, you can continue setting up
  Windows for Workgroups by following the instructions on your
  screen.

  If the situation does affect Setup and prevents it from installing
  Windows for Workgroups on your computer, follow the instructions on
  the screen to quit Setup, and then complete the following steps.

3. Quit the TSR and remove all references to it from your
  AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files. For more information,
  see the documentation for your TSR.

4. Restart your computer.

5. Run Windows for Workgroups Setup again.

After Windows for Workgroups is successfully set up, you may want to
restore your TSRs.

Not all TSRs or drivers included in the "Program Listing" section are
detected by Setup. The TSRs and drivers that Setup detects are in the
SETUP.INF file, listed under the names "incomptsr1" and "incomptsr2".

Program Listing
===============

This section describes some problems, discovered during testing, that
you might encounter while using a TSR with Windows for Workgroups. It
does not include all possible problems that can occur.

386MAX
------

The documentation for 386MAX recommends against setting the EXT
parameter below 64. If you set this parameter to 0, Setup and Windows
for Workgroups running in standard mode will fail.

See the README.WRI online document for more information about running
386MAX with Windows for Workgroups.

386MAX Disk-Cache Utility (QCACHE.EXE)
--------------------------------------

Do not use this disk-cache utility simultaneously with SMARTDrive.
There is no reason to use two disk-cache utilities with Windows for
Workgroups. It is recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with
Windows for Workgroups, instead.

All Charge 386 Version 3.1
--------------------------

ALLEMM4.SYS is a memory manager that causes problems with Setup and
Windows for Workgroups. If you encounter problems running this program
with Windows for Workgroups, it is recommended that you use EMM386.EXE
and HIMEM.SYS, provided with Windows for Workgroups, to manage memory
instead.

Anarkey Version 4.00
--------------------

With some memory configurations, Anarkey version 4.00 running with
Windows for Workgroups in 386 enhanced mode may cause unpredictable
system failures. In rare cases, this program can also corrupt hard-
disk data. In addition, Windows for Workgroups might not start when
this program is running.

Do not run Windows for Workgroups in 386 enhanced mode when Anarkey
version 4.00 is running. Version 4.01 may correct these problems.
Contact Moderne Software for a free upgrade to Anarkey 4.01.

Anarkey Version 4.01
--------------------

If Anarkey version 4.01 is loaded before starting Windows for
Workgroups in standard mode, it is not available in any instance of
MS-DOS Prompt that you start within Windows for Workgroups. In this
case, it is recommended that you load Anarkey from each instance of
MS-DOS Prompt, as needed.

Do not load Anarkey HIGH before starting Windows for Workgroups in 386
enhanced mode. If you load Anarkey HIGH, your system may fail when you
try to start an application.

APPEND (MS-DOS)
---------------

Do not use the APPEND utility with Windows for Workgroups. It prevents
Windows and Windows-based applications from creating valid Well-
Formed-Path (WFP) names for the files they are using. (A WFP is the
complete name of a file, including the drive letter and full path
specification, starting from the root directory.)

ASP Integrity Toolkit Version 3.7
---------------------------------

This product is a virus-protection program that can cause problems
when running Setup, including system failure, automatic restarting of
the system, and the inability to use the keyboard. You should turn off
protection in the toolkit before setting up Windows for Workgroups.
For information about how to do this, see your ASP Integrity
documentation.

Note: Setting up Windows for Workgroups is considered a system-
administration task. The ASP Integrity Toolkit documentation instructs
you to turn off protection when performing these types of tasks.

Autocon Version 2.0e
--------------------

Autocon enables you to select up to fifty different configurations
when starting your system. To do this, it modifies the CONFIG.SYS and
AUTOEXEC.BAT files, based on information in its database AUTOCON.DAT),
when you restart your system from within AUTOCON.

Windows for Workgroups Setup modifies only the first section in the
CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. If you want to use specific
configurations with Windows, you must run Autocon and then manually
edit the configurations in the database that you want to use. You must
do this after setting up Windows for Workgroups. For your changes to
take effect, you must restart your system from within Autocon. For
more information, see your Autocon documentation.

Bootcon Version 1.60
--------------------

Using Bootcon, you can maintain different system-configuration
information in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. You can then
select the configuration you want to use from a menu when starting
your system.

Setup modifies the first section in the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
files, and may modify certain other sections that contain network
drivers (for example, LAN Manager drivers and NetWare drivers may be
deleted). After you set up Windows for Workgroups, you must edit the
sections of those files that contain other configurations you want to
use. For more information, see your Bootcon documentation.

BOOT.SYS
--------

Using BOOT.SYS, you can maintain different system-configuration
information in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. You can then
select the configuration you want to use from a menu when starting
your system.

Setup modifies the first section in the CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
files, and may modify certain other sections that contain network
drivers (for example, LAN Manager drivers and NetWare drivers may be
deleted). After you set up Windows for Workgroups, you must edit the
sections of those files that contain other configurations you want to
use. For more information, see your BOOT.SYS documentation.

CACHE.EXE Disk-Cache Utility
----------------------------

Do not use two disk-cache utilities with Windows for Workgroups. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows for
Workgroups, and remove all references to other disk-cache utilities
from your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. (If CACHE.EXE is
detected, Setup removes it from the CONFIG.SYS file for you.)

CACHE.SYS Disk-Cache Utility
----------------------------

This disk-cache utility will not work properly with SMARTDrive. It is
recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with Windows for
Workgroups, and remove all references to other disk-cache utilities
from your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files. (If CACHE.SYS is
detected, Setup removes it from the CONFIG.SYS file for you.)

CED Version 1.0e
----------------

Using CED with Windows for Workgroups may cause problems, including
system failure. It is recommended that you do not use CED with Windows
for Workgroups.

Central Point Anti-Virus Version 1.1 (VSAFE.COM/VSAFE.SYS)
----------------------------------------------------------

VSAFE.COM/VSAFE.SYS should not be loaded when you set up Windows for
Workgroups. Otherwise, Setup may not run properly. After you set up
Windows for Workgroups, you can load VSAFE.

Because Windows uses the disk for memory swapping, you should turn off
the VSAFE write-protection option when running Windows for Workgroups.

For more information, see the Central Point Anti-Virus documentation.

CMDEDIT.COM Version 2.0 (Date 12-6-91)
--------------------------------------

If this command-line editor is loaded before starting Windows for
Workgroups, it may cause a General Protection Fault when you run
multiple MS-DOS Prompts in 386 enhanced mode. Also, it cannot be
loaded from an MS-DOS Prompt within Windows when Windows is running in
standard mode.

Cubit Version 3.01
------------------

When using Cubit with Windows for Workgroups, do not compress the
Windows SYSTEM directory or any file that is loaded from the
CONFIG.SYS file. Compressing these files could cause problems.

Before upgrading to Windows for Workgroups, make sure that the earlier
version of Windows is uncompressed on your hard disk. You may
recompress the files after you have successfully set up Windows for
Workgroups.

Data Physician Plus Version 2.0 (VirALERT)
------------------------------------------

It is recommended that you do not set up Windows for Workgroups while
VirALERT is running. If you do, VirALERT will display a warning
message every few seconds while Setup is running.

After you have set up Windows for Workgroups, you can run VirALERT.
Press ALT+V to display the VirALERT menu. You can use the commands on
this menu to disable and enable VirALERT.

DOSCUE.COM Command-Line Editor
------------------------------

The DOSCUE command-line editor produces unexpected results when used
with Windows for Workgroups. It is recommended that you do not use
this editor with Windows for Workgroups.

Doubledisk Version 2.5
----------------------

Windows for Workgroups may try to access "phantom" disk drives if you
use it with Doubledisk. Phantom drives occur when you use Doubledisk
to create a compressed drive. For example, if you have drives A, B,
and C on your computer and you use Doubledisk to create drive F,
Windows for Workgroups and MS-DOS recognize drives D and E as valid
drives, even though they do not actually exist. You can use the DRVOFF
utility to prevent Windows from recognizing phantom drives. Contact
Vertisoft to order a copy of the DRVOFF utility.

FASTOPEN (MS-DOS)
-----------------

FASTOPEN is a RAM-resident utility. Problems involving the file
allocation table (FAT) may occur if FASTOPEN is used together with
disk-defragmenting utilities. In low-memory situations, you may need
to remove FASTOPEN for Windows for Workgroups to run properly.

Flash Disk-Cache Utility (FLASH.EXE)
-------------------------------------

Do not use this disk-cache utility simultaneously with SMARTDrive.
There is no reason to use two disk-cache utilities with Windows for
Workgroups. It is recommended that you use SMARTDrive, provided with
Windows for Workgroups, instead.

Graphics (MS-DOS)
-----------------

Loading Graphics from MS-DOS Prompt within Windows can cause
unexpected results when printing. The active MS-DOS Prompt will send
its output to the printer. Switching between multiple MS-DOS Prompts
may result in mixed printing jobs.
