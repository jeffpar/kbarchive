- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows for Workgroups fully supports connectivity with Microsoft LAN
Manager (using NetBEUI protocol) and Novell NetWare (using MSIPX protocol).

This article contains information on enabling the Microsoft TCP/IP protocol
included with Microsoft LAN Manager for use with Windows for Workgroups version
3.1.

NOTE: This article applies to Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 only; it does
not apply to later versions of the product.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The information in this article was taken from the "Windows for Workgroups
Resource Kit" manual, Appendix E, page E3. For more information concerning
enabling additional protocols with Windows for Workgroups, please refer to that
manual.

Configuring the Microsoft TCP/IP Protocol
-----------------------------------------

Installation of the TCP/IP protocol stack requires the manipulation of the
CONFIG.SYS, AUTOEXEC.BAT, PROTOCOL.INI, and SYSTEM.INI files on Windows for
Workgroups computers. The following steps were prepared to make the task easier.
A completed example of each of these files has been provided at the end of this
section for reference.

NOTE: The following steps discuss the installation of the basic TCP/IP protocol
stack. These procedures do not discuss the installation of the TCP/IP Utility
pack. Thus, this installation won't permit the use of the sockets library.

1. Install MS-DOS LAN Manager on a computer.

  Before installing TCP/IP, you must first get a copy of the files. To do this,
  install MS-DOS LAN Manager on a single computer, then copy the files on a
  floppy disk or a file share point for distribution to Windows for Workgroups
  computers.

  NOTE: Please follow the procedures and installation prompts for installing the
  TCP/IP protocol stack. When prompted for the IP address, sub-net mask, and
  the default gateway address, you may want to use information for one of the
  workstations you will be installing. You will be adding this information
  manually to the PROTOCOL.INI file during the actual installation.

2. Copy the following files to a floppy disk:

        C:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\PROTOCOL\TCPIP\EMSBFR.EXE
        C:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\PROTOCOL\TCPIP\NEMM.DOS
        C:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\PROTOCOL\TCPIP\TCPTSR.EXE
        C:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\PROTOCOL\TCPIP\TCPDRV.DOS
        C:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\PROTOCOL\TCPIP\TINYRFC.EXE
        C:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\PROTOCOL\TCPIP\UMB.COM
        C:\LANMAN.DOS\DRIVERS\PROTOCOL\TCPIP\NMTSR.EXE
        C:\LANMAN.DOS\TCPUTILS.INI
        C:\LANMAN.DOS\NETPROG\PING.EXE

3. Install Windows for Workgroups on a computer.

4. Copy the TCP/IP files from the floppy disk in step 2 on the Windows directory
  of the Windows for Workgroups computer. (If Windows for Workgroups was
  installed in a directory besides Windows, copy these files to that
  directory.)

5. In the CONFIG.SYS file, insert the following lines immediately after the line
  that installs PROTMAN.DOS (before WORKGRP.SYS is referenced):

        device=c:\Windows\nemm.DOS
        device=c:\Windows\tcpdrv.DOS /i:c:\Windows

  NOTE: The directories for the device drivers and the information pointer for
  the TCPUTILS.INI file (/i:c:\Windows) may be different if Windows for
  Workgroups was installed in a directory other than that referenced in these
  procedures. Refer to the directory discussion in step 4.

6. Make the following modifications to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

   - Immediately before the net start line, add the following line:

           c:\Windows\umb.com
         

   - Immediately after the net start line, add the following lines:

           c:\windows\emsbfr
           c:\windows\tcptsr
           c:\windows\tinyrfc
           c:\windows\nmtsr

7. Make the following modifications to the \WINDOWS\PROTOCOL.INI file:

   - After the last existing transport line in the [network.setup] section, add
     the following line:

           transport=ms$tcp,ms$tcp
         

   - After the last existing LANA number line in the [network.setup] section,
     add the following line:

        lana1=ms$elnkii,1,ms$tcp
      

     NOTE: The LANA number may be different if other protocols are being loaded
     before the TCP/IP stack. Also, the device driver identifier (shown as
     MS$ELNKII in these steps) is dependent on the type of network interface
     card you are using.

   - Add the following lines to the end of the PROTOCOL.INI file:

           [ms$tcp]
           drivername=TCPIP$
           nbsessions=10
           bindings=ms$elnkii
           lanabase=1
           ipaddress0=11 1 7 99
           subnetmask0=255 255 0 0
           defaultgateway0=11 1 0 1

  NOTE: The resource kit has a documentation error in the steps for installing
  the TCP/IP Protocol Stack on Windows for Workgroups. On page E-8, the
  instruction drivername=tcpip$ should read as follows: drivername=TCPIP$

NOTES
   - The lanabase= value must match the lanax= entry in the [network. setup]
     section. The bindings= entry is the section name ( [xxxxxx] ) of the
     device driver to which the TCP/IP stack will be bound. This value is
     dependent on the type of network interface card used. The ipaddress0,
     subnetmask0, and defaultgateway0 values are computer-and site-dependent.
     These values are provided as an example. Of special interest is that
     spaces are used as separators in the numbers instead of the more
     traditional periods.

   - Notice the nbsessions value was increased from its LAN Manager default
     value of 6, to increase the number of sessions supported by the TCP/IP
     device driver.

8. In the \Windows\SYSTEM.INI file, increase the netheapsize= parameter in the
  [386Enh] section from its default value of 20 to 60.

  NOTE: The additional memory is needed as buffer space for passing network
  frames between real and protected mode.

9. Restart the target computer. Once all steps are completed and verified,
  restart the computer to load the needed device drivers and TSRs.

  Notice that NMTSR.EXE is an optional component and is used only with the PING
  utility. The following are the final installation images of CONFIG.SYS,
  AUTOEXEC.BAT, and PROTOCOL.INI.

  The following is an example of a CONFIG.SYS file image:

        device=c:\dos\setver.exe
        device=c:\windows\himem.sys
        device=c:\windows\emm386.exe noems x=b800-c800
        dos=high,umb
        files=30
        buffers=10
        lastdrive=z
        device=c:\windows\protman.dos /i:c:\windows
        device=c:\windows\nemm.dos
        device=c:\windows\tcpdrv.dos /i:c:\windows
        device=c:\windows\workgrp.sys
        device=c:\windows\elnkii.dos
        stacks=9,256

  The following is an example of a AUTOEXEC.BAT file image:

        c:\windows\smartdrv.exe
        c:\windows\umb.com
        c:\windows\net start
        c:\windows\emsbfr
        c:\windows\tcptsr
        c:\windows\tinyrfc
        c:\windows\nmtsr
        @echo off
        prompt $p$g
        path c:\windows;c:\dos
        set temp=c:\dos

  The following is an example of a PROTOCOL.INI file image:

  NOTE: The ms$elnkii keyname used in the following example specifies the use of
  the 3Com EtherLink II network adapter card driver. Use the name of the
  network adapter card driver that is present in your existing PROTOCOL.INI
  file.

  [network.setup]
        version=0x3100
        netcard=ms$elnkii,1,ms$elnkii
        transport=ms$netbeui,ms$netbeui
        transport=ms$tcp,ms$tcp
        lana0=ms$elnkii,1,ms$netbeui
        lana1=ms$elnkii,1,ms$tcp

        [protman]
        drivername=protman$
        priority=ms$netbeui

        [ms$elnkii]
        drivername=elnkii$
        interrupt=5
        ioaddress=0x300
        maxtransmits=40
        transceiver=external

        [ms$netbeui]
        drivername=netbeui$
        sessions=6
        ncbs=12
        bindings=ms$elnkii
        lanabase=0

        [ms$tcp]
        drivername=tcpip$
        nbsessions=10
        bindings=ms$elnkii
        lanabase=1
        ipaddress0=11 1 7 99
        subnetmask0=255 255 00
        defaultgateway0=11 1 0 1

Additional Information About TCP/IP Installation:
-------------------------------------------------

WORKGRP.SYS gives a diagnostic error at startup (No NETBEUI section found in
configuration information) if you do not have NetBEUI as an additional protocol.
This is expected and harmless.
