SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses using OnTrack's Disk Manager version 5.1 with Microsoft
Windows version 3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Compatibility with SmartDrive version 4.0
-----------------------------------------

According to OnTrack Technical Support, Disk Manager version 5.1 is compatible
with SmartDrive version 4.0, although there may be some problems using it with
SmartDrive's Double_Buffer command, depending upon your hardware configuration:

- System with no SCSI adapter

  OnTrack recommends removing the

  DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.EXE
     /DOUBLE_BUFFER

  line in the CONFIG.SYS on all systems that do not have a SCSI host adapter.

- System with a SCSI adapter, but no drives with more than 1024 cylinders

  OnTrack recommends adding the line

  DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\SMARTDRV.EXE
     /DOUBLE_BUFFER+

  in order to support partitions larger than 32 MB with MS- DOS versions 3.3 and
  earlier. If the plus sign is omitted, SmartDrive will fail.

- System with a SCSI adapter and drives with more than 1024 cylinders

  OnTrack recommends removing the SmartDrive DEVICE= statement (even if it is
  using the Double_Buffer command) in the CONFIG.SYS file on all systems with a
  SCSI adapter and drives with more than 1024 cylinders. It should be noted
  that with this configuration Windows will not run in 386 enhanced mode.

Compatibility with Windows 3.1 Swap Files
-----------------------------------------

According to OnTrack, Disk Manager 5.1 is compatible with Windows 3.1 swap files
but you may be prevented from creating a permanent swap file in the following
situations:

- Head or sector-per-track mismatch (unless IDE)

  If the number of heads and sectors per track specified by your CMOS drive type
  entry does not match the actual number of heads and sectors per track of your
  drive, your configuration prevents the use of a permanent swap file.
  Resolving this conflict requires that you reinstall your drive and will
  likely result in lost disk space. If you must use a permanent swap file,
  OnTrack Technical Support can provide suggestions on reconfiguring your
  system to allow it.

- Large partitions with MS-DOS version 3.3 and earlier

  If you are using MS-DOS 3.3 or earlier and have a partition larger than 32 MB,
  you cannot use a permanent swap file. To use a permanent swap file with your
  system, you must either upgrade to MS-DOS 4.0 or later and reinstall your
  system or make all partitions 32 MB or less and reinstall with your current
  version of MS-DOS.

- Drives with more than 1024 cylinders

  Permanent swap files can be accessed by Windows only if they are created
  within the first 1024 cylinders of your drive. Make sure you create your swap
  file on a partition that contains 1024 cylinders or less. Otherwise, Windows
  will issue a corrupt swap file error when started. If you have a drive with
  more than 1024 cylinders, you need to manually enable permanent swap file
  support by modifying the DMDRVR device statement in your CONFIG.SYS file to
  include a /P option as shown below:

  device=c:\dmdrvr.bin /p

If you have problems with corrupt swap file errors when using the /P option, it
is likely that your drive partition is not located within the first 1024
cylinders.
