The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows for Workgroups caches passwords so you don't have to retype them for
every shared resource. If you connect to a shared directory with a read-only
password, and you configure Windows to reconnect to that shared directory on
startup, you do not have the opportunity to re-enter the full access password.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To gain full access, reconnect to the same shared directory:

1. From the Disk menu, choose Connect Network Drive.

2. In the Drive box, change the letter to the letter of the drive for which you
  have read-only access.

3. In the Path dialog box, type the name of the share that you want to change to
  full access.

4. Choose the OK button.

5. Windows for Workgroups prompts you that you are already connected to the
  drive. When you choose the OK button, you have the opportunity to enter the
  full access password.

6. Choose the OK button.

NOTE: You can also use this procedure to change from full access to read-only
access.

For more information on password caching, query on the following words in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  windows or workgroups and password and caching or cache

Additional query words: 3.10 persistent network connection connections
