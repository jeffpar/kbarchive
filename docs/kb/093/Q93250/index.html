SUMMARY
=======

Windows CSV defines a standard and consistent API for the 16 and 32-bit versions
of the Microsoft Windows graphical environment. It encompasses a set of
Windows-specific extensions designed to allow the programmer to take advantage
of the message-driven nature of the Windows graphical environment.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  WinCsv.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/platformsdk/file95/3.1/W31/EN-US/WinCsv.exe)

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

This API has been designed and specified to provide a standard to which
application developers can program and network software vendors can conform.
These API details constitute documentation for application software developers
and a specification for network software vendors.

Network software that conforms to this Windows CSV specification will be
considered "Windows CSV compliant." To be Windows CSV compliant, a vendor must
implement 100 percent of this Windows CSV specification. Suppliers of such
interfaces shall be referred to as "Windows CSV suppliers."

Applications that are capable of exploiting any Windows CSV implementation will
be considered as having a "Windows CSV interface" and will be referred to as
"Windows CSV applications."

While this is one of the WinSNA APIs to be standardized for the Windows
environment, it is beyond the scope of this document to deal with other SNA
(Systems Network Architecture) APIs.

Microsoft Windows Graphical Environment and Windows-Specific
Extensions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This API has been designed for ALL implementations and versions of the Windows
environment from and including version 3.0. It thus provides for Windows CSV
implementations and Windows CSV applications in both 16 and 32-bit operating
environments.

Windows CSV makes provisions for multithreaded Windows-based processes. A process
contains one or more threads of execution. In the Win16 non- threaded world, a
task corresponds to a process with a single thread. All references to threads in
this document refer to actual "threads" in multithreaded Windows environments.
In non-multithreaded environments (such as version 3.0), use of the term thread
refers to a Windows process.

The extensions to the Windows environment included in Windows CSV are provided
for maximum programming compatibility between Windows 3.x and Windows NT and
optimum application performance in both environments.
