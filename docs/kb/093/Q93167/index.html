- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0

SUMMARY
=======

When you start MS-DOS Shell, the DOSSHELL.INI file is read into memory. Each
unique item in the DOSSHELL.INI file is stored as a token (there is a 2000 token
limit). When this limit is reached, any action that causes MS- DOS Shell to
write to the DOSSHELL.INI file (which requires a new token) causes the computer
to beep. For example, the computer beeps when you try to add a New Program
Object.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A token is a word, a string of text, or a symbol. The following DOSSHELL.INI
file entry would be represented in memory by three tokens; one for the word
"help," one for the equal sign, and one for the string of text to the right of
the equal sign:

  help = Starts the MS-DOS command prompt

Once a token has been used to represent a word, string, or symbol, each
additional occurrence of the word, string, or symbol does not require an
additional token. For example, the following block of text uses 11 tokens:

  startup = filemanager
  filemanagermode = shared
  sortkey = name
  pause = disabled
  explicitselection = disabled
  swapmouse = disabled

Only one token is used to represent each occurrence of the equal sign and one
token is used to represent each occurrence of the word "disabled."

What Happens When New Tokens Are Added
--------------------------------------

The text on the left of the equal sign is usually a common word (such as
"sortkey," "pause," "swapmouse," and so on) that is used repeatedly in the
DOSSHELL.INI file. Therefore, each new line added to the DOSSHELL.INI file
usually requires only one new token for the string to the right of the equal
sign.

If you reach the 2000 token limit, you can remove unneeded lines to make room for
additional Program Objects or other items.

The following items can usually be removed without significantly impacting your
MS-DOS Shell configuration:

- Color schemes you do not use.

- Default program items and groups you don't use.

- Help text (If you don't need or use it).
