-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following information was taken from the Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
version 3.1 WININI.WRI file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WIN.INI File Settings
---------------------

Windows initialization files contain information that defines your
Windows environment. Windows for Workgroups and Windows-based
applications can use the information stored in these files to
configure themselves to meet your needs and preferences.

There are two standard Windows initialization files:

- WIN.INI, which primarily contains settings that Windows maintains
  to customize your Windows environment according to your
  preferences.

- SYSTEM.INI, which primarily contains settings that customize
  Windows to meet your system's hardware needs.

This document describes only a few of the settings in the WIN.INI
file. You can get a more complete listing of the WIN.INI settings by
purchasing the Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit for the Microsoft
Windows Operating System Version 3.1. The Windows for Workgroups
Resource Kit provides complete technical information about Windows for
Workgroups for the support professional. It includes a technical
reference manual and a disk containing helpful utilities, system-
resource viewers, drivers, and accessories.

To order the Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit within the United
States, call (800) 642-7676.

To order outside of the United States, dial the phone number for your
area. You can find this number on the International Subsidiary card.

Format of the WIN.INI File
--------------------------

The WIN.INI file contains several sections, each of which consists of
a group of related settings. The sections and settings are listed in
the WIN.INI file in the following format:

  [section name]
  keyname=value

In this example, [section name] is the name of a section. The square
brackets ([ ]) are required, and the left bracket must be in the
leftmost column on the screen.

The keyname=value statement defines the value of each setting. A
keyname is the name of a setting. It can consist of any combination of
letters and digits in uppercase or lowercase, and it must be followed
immediately by an equal sign (=). The value can be an integer, a
string, or a string enclosed in quotation marks, depending on the
setting.

You can include comments in initialization files. You must begin each
line of a comment with a semicolon (;).

Updating WIN.INI from Previous Versions of Windows
--------------------------------------------------

If you update your system to Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 from
Windows version 3.0, Setup automatically updates your WIN.INI file by
making the following changes. For detailed information about these
settings, refer to the Windows for Workgroups Resource Kit.

In the [windows] section, Setup adds three new settings:

  KeyboardDelay=
  ScreenSaverTimeout=
  DosPrint=

If the following settings are already present in the 3.0 version of
the WIN.INI file, Setup does not change them. If they are not present,
Setup adds them:

  Device=
  Documents=
  Programs=com exe bat pif

In the [extensions] section, Setup adds one new setting:

  bmp=pbrush.exe ^.bmp

Setup adds two other settings to the [extensions] section, if they are
not already present in the 3.0 version of the WIN.INI file:

  pcx=pbrush.exe ^.pcx
  rec=recorder.exe ^.rec

In the [ports] section, Setup adds:

  LPT1.DOS
  LPT2.DOS

Setup adds three other settings to the [ports] section, if they are
not already present in the 3.0 version of WIN.INI:

  FILE:
  COM3:=9600,n,8,1,x
  COM4:=9600,n,8,1,x

Setup adds the following section and settings to support TrueType
fonts:

  [FontSubstitutes]
  Helv=MS Sans Serif
  Tms Rmn=MS Serif
  Times=Times New Roman
  Helvetica=Arial

Setup adds the following sections and settings to support multimedia:

  [mci extensions]
  wav=waveaudio
  mid=sequencer
  rmi=sequencer

Setup adds the following sections and settings to support sound:

  [sounds]
  SystemDefault=ding.wav, Default Beep
  SystemExclamation=chord.wav, Exclamation
  SystemStart=tada.wav, Windows Start
  SystemExit=chimes.wav, Windows Exit
  SystemHand=chord.wav, Critical Stop
  SystemQuestion=chord.wav, Question
  SystemAsterisk=chord.wav, Asterisk

Setup adds the following section and settings to support object
linking and embedding:

  [embedding]
  SoundRec=Sound,Sound,SoundRec.exe,picture
  Package=Package,Package,packager.exe,picture
  PBrush=Paintbrush Picture,Paintbrush Picture,pbrush.exe,picture

Setup also makes additional changes, depending on the applications and
devices installed on your system.

How to Read this Document
-------------------------

In this document, WIN.INI settings are listed alphabetically within
sections. However, the settings do not appear alphabetically in the
WIN.INI file. To change a setting, you need to search for it within
the appropriate section.

This document lists the syntax, default value, purpose, and
recommended method for changing each setting, using the following
format.

SettingName=&lt;value-type&gt;

Default:   The Windows default value for this setting.

Purpose:   This paragraph briefly describes the function of the setting
               and its default value (if applicable).

To change: Describes the recommended method for changing the value
               of this setting.

&lt;value-type&gt; indicates whether the value should be an integer, a
letter, a range of numbers, or something else.

Changing Settings
-----------------

When the Setup program creates the WIN.INI file, it assigns default
values to the settings. Some settings that are listed in this document
may not appear in your WIN.INI file.

There are two ways to change WIN.INI settings:

- You can use Control Panel to change most settings. This is the
  safest and most recommended way because there is no need to open
  and edit the WIN.INI file, where it is easier to make mistakes. For
  more information about Control Panel, see Chapter 9, "Customizing
  Windows for Workgroups," in the Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
  User's Guide.

- You can use a text editor, such as Notepad, to edit the WIN.INI
  file directly. (Do not use a formatting editor, such as Write; it
  can corrupt your WIN.INI file.) You must use this method to change
  the settings that you cannot change by using Control Panel. After
  you have edited the WIN.INI file, you must restart Windows for
  Workgroups for the settings to take effect. For more information
  about Notepad, see Help for Notepad.

Caution: Always back up your WIN.INI file before you make changes, so
that you can restore the original file in case you accidentally damage
the WIN.INI file or make changes that cause problems when running
Windows for Workgroups. It is recommended that you do not change any
settings that are not described in this document. However, if you need
to change additional settings, refer to the Windows for Workgroups
Resource Kit. Be careful when using a text editor to edit the WIN.INI
file. Incorrect changes to WIN.INI can cause unexpected results when
you run Windows for Workgroups.

[windows] Section Settings
==========================

The [windows] section contains settings that affect general areas of
your Windows environment, such as which applications run when you
start Windows for Workgroups and how information appears on your
screen.

The [windows] section can contain the following settings.

DoubleClickHeight=&lt;pixels&gt;

Default:   4

Purpose:   Specifies the height (in pixels) that the mouse
               pointer can move between clicks when you double-click.
               If the mouse pointer is moved further up or down, the
               two clicks are treated as separate single clicks. For
               example, if DoubleClickHeight=10, the mouse pointer
               cannot move vertically more than 5 pixels between
               clicks in order for the two clicks to be recognized as
               a double-click. If you use an odd number, it is
               rounded up to the nearest even number. This setting is
               helpful if you are using a pen-tablet pointing device.

To change: Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.

DoubleClickWidth=&lt;pixels&gt;

Default:   4

Purpose:   Specifies the width (in pixels) that the mouse pointer can
               move between clicks when you double-click. If the
               mouse pointer is moved further right or left, the two
               clicks are treated as separate single clicks. For
               example, if DoubleClickWidth=10, the mouse pointer
               cannot move horizontally more than 5 pixels between
               clicks in order for the two clicks to be recognized as
               a double-click. If you use an odd number, it is
               rounded up to the nearest even number. This setting is
               helpful if you are using a pen-tablet pointing device.

To change:    Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.

Load=&lt;filename(s)&gt;

Default:   None

Purpose:   Specifies one or more applications to run as icons when
               Windows for Workgroups is started. This value is a
               list of one or more filenames of applications, or
               documents that are associated with an application,
               each separated by a space. Specify the complete path
               if the application or document is not located in the
               Windows directory.

To change:    Add the application to the StartUp group in Program
               Manager, and then select the Minimize On Use check box
               in the Properties dialog box.

MenuDropAlignment=&lt;0-or-1&gt;

Default:   0

Purpose:   Specifies whether menus open right-aligned or left-aligned
               with the menu title. If this setting is 0, menus open
               so that they are left-aligned. If it is 1, menus open
               so that they are right-aligned.

To change: Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.

MenuShowDelay=&lt;milliseconds&gt;

Default:   0 for 80386 computers; 400 for 80286 computers

Purpose:   Specifies how long Windows waits before displaying a
               cascading menu.

To change: Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.

Programs=&lt;extensions&gt;

Default:   com exe bat pif

Purpose:   Defines which files Windows considers applications. A
               filename extension is separated by a space and does
               not include the preceding period.

To change: Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.

Run=&lt;filename(s)&gt;

Default:   None

Purpose:   Causes Windows for Workgroups to run one or more specified
               applications when it is started. The value is a list
               of one or more filenames of applications, or documents
               associated with applications, each separated by a
               space. Specify the complete path if the application or
               document is not located in the Windows directory.

To change: Add the application to the StartUp group in Program
               Manager.

[desktop] Section Settings
==========================

The [desktop] section contains optional settings that control the
appearance of the screen background (desktop) and the positioning of
windows and icons on the screen. Most of these settings (which are not
listed in this document) can be changed by using Control Panel. The
following setting must be changed by editing the WIN.INI file.

IconVerticalSpacing=&lt;pixels&gt;

Default:   Windows determines the default value based on the icon title
               font and the display adapter you are using.

Purpose:   Specifies the number of pixels that appear vertically
               between icons. Increasing this number increases the
               amount of vertical space between icons.

[fonts] Section Settings
========================

The [fonts] section describes one or more font files that are loaded
when Windows for Workgroups is started.

The [fonts] section can contain one or more occurrences of the
following setting.

&lt;font-name&gt;=&lt;font-file&gt;

Purpose:   Specifies a font file. The &lt;font-name&gt; keyname is the
               descriptive name of a font. The &lt;font-file&gt; value is
               the filename of a file that contains font resources.

To change: In the Control Panel window, choose the Fonts icon.

[mci extensions] Section Settings
=================================

The [mci extensions] section contains settings that associate
different types of media files with different Media Control Interface
(MCI) device drivers. Whenever a media file is selected, Windows uses
the associated driver to play it.

The [mci extensions] section can contain one or more occurrences of
the following setting.

&lt;extension&gt;=&lt;mci-device-type&gt;

Purpose:   Associates files that have the specified extension with the
               specified MCI device driver. Windows uses the
               specified driver to play the media file associated
               with it.

To change: Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.

[Windows Help] Section Settings
===============================

The [Windows Help] section includes settings that specify the size and
placement of the Help window and dialog boxes, in addition to the
color of text that, when chosen, displays a macro, pop-up window, or
new Help window.

The [Windows Help] section can include the following settings.

JumpColor=&lt;red-value&gt; &lt;green-value&gt; &lt;blue-value&gt;

Purpose:   Specifies the color of text that, when chosen, leads to a
               new window of Help information. For example,
               specifying 000 000 000 as values results in black text
               on a white background.

To change: Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.

Note: If no PopupColor value is specified, the JumpColor also applies
to text that, when chosen, displays a pop-up window.

PopupColor=&lt;red-value&gt; &lt;green-value&gt; &lt;blue-value&gt;

Purpose:   Specifies the color of text that, when chosen, displays a
               pop-up window (the type of window used for glossary
               definitions). For example, specifying 000 000 000 as
               values results in black text on a white background.

To change: Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.

MacroColor=&lt;red-value&gt; &lt;green-value&gt; &lt;blue-value&gt;

Purpose:   Specifies the color of text that, when chosen, runs a
               Help macro.

To change: Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.

IFJumpColor=&lt;red-value&gt; &lt;green-value&gt; &lt;blue-value&gt;

Purpose:   Specifies the color of text that, when chosen, leads to a
               new window of Help information, located in a different
               Help file.

To change: Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.

IFPopupColor=&lt;red-value&gt; &lt;green-value&gt; &lt;blue-value&gt;

Purpose:   Specifies the color of text that, when chosen, displays a
               pop-up window (the type of window used for glossary
               definitions), located in a different Help file.

To change: Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
