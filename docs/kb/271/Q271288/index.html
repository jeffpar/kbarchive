SYMPTOMS
========

Domain trust relationships may be periodically unsuccessful, often at one week
intervals, and must be continually re-established.

The System event log may also record the following error message:

  Event ID: 3210
  Source: Netlogon
  Type: Error
  Description: Failed to authenticate with &lt;computer name&gt;, a Windows NT
  domain controller for domain &lt;domain name&gt;.
  Data word: c0000022

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may occur if third-party programs are used for password
synchronization.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Third-party products can be used to synchronize passwords for accounts that use
different platforms. Some of these products run as a service on the domain's
primary domain controller (PDC).

When a trust is established between two domains, an interdomain trust account is
created. This account is configured with an initial password when the trust is
created. This password is changed at certain intervals during the life of the
trust. The default interval is seven days.

When you make a password change to an interdomain trust account, the password
synchronization service may mistakenly detect the change and replicate it to
other domain controllers that run the service and with whom there is a trust
relationship with the same domain.

Here is an example to illustrate the preceding information:

  DOMA (Domain A) ----TRUSTS---&gt; DOMB (Domain B)

The interdomain trust account DOMA$ resides in DOMB.

NOTE: The type of account is interdomain trust account, not a normal user
account.

By default, every seven days, the PDC in DOMA generates a new password for the
DOMA$ interdomain trust account which resides in DOMB and attempts to set a new
secure channel password for that account.

If successful, the PDC in DOMA stores the new password and uses it the next time
it wants to set up a secure channel. If, for any reason, the password change is
unsuccessful, the PDC in DOMA retains the password it has been using, and
discards the new password.

If the password for the DOMA$ account residing in DOMB is changed by a
third-party process, then the password stored by the PDC in DOMA that uses this
account goes out of synchronization.

The next time the PDC in DOMA attempts to set up a secure channel with DOMB using
the password it has stored, it is unsuccessful in establishing a secure channel.
At this point the trust relationship is broken. If NetLogon debugging is
enabled, the NetLogon.log file can record the following message:

07/12 20:30:03 [CRITICAL] NlSessionSetup: DOMA Session setup: cannot I_NetServerAuthenticate 0xc0000022										
07/12 20:30:03 [CRITICAL] NlSessionSetup: DOMA new password is bad. Old password is same as new password.
