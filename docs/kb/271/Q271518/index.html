- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use roaming profiles and you log on to both Windows 2000-based and
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0-based clients, the roaming profile may include the
Ntuser.pol file. This file may have a .tmp extension added to the file name (for
example, Ntuser.pol.tmp). This may occur more than once, which causes the file
name to become very long.

CAUSE
=====

This file is created by Windows 2000 with system and hidden attributes. Windows
NT 4.0 adds a .tmp extension to the file name because it is not expecting these
attributes.

==========
