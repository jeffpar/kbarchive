-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 clients may disregard the specified polling
interval for advertisements, and use the default value of 60 minutes. This
occurs when you have cleared the "Client Cannot Change Agent Settings" check box
in the Advertised Programs Client Agent properties, and you do not restart the
workstation after installing the client software.

CAUSE
=====

When you install the client components, certain registry keys are created and
populated with values. The key located at

  HKLM\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Client\Configuration\Client Application
  Launchers\System Offer Data Provider\Next Run

specifies the polling interval for the System Offer Data Provider (ODPSYS) to
poll for advertisements. When the key is initially written it is populated with
a value that is one hour in the future. The expected behavior is that during the
next client refresh cycle (every 23 hours), or after restarting the workstation,
this value should be modified to reflect the site- or client-specified polling
interval. In instances where you install the SMS client, and you do not restart
the workstation, this value is not reset to match the defined interval but
continues to use the 60-minute default value.

RESOLUTION
==========

By restarting the workstation, or running Cliutils.exe to force a refresh cycle
on the client, this key is reset with the correct value. Clients that are not
restarted, or that do not run Cliutils.exe will continue to only poll for
advertised programs every 60 minutes, no matter what the interval is set to on
the client or site. This problem is more prevalent on a Microsoft Windows 95, or
Microsoft Windows 98 client computer that does not require a reboot after
installing the client components.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.
