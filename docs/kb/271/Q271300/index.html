-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Reader, version 1.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Microsoft Reader on a desktop or a laptop computer, you may
receive the following error message:

  Unhandled exception 0xC0000005: AV

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if both of the following conditions are true:

- Less than 300 megabytes (MB) of space is available on your system hard disk
  (the hard disk on which Microsoft Windows is installed).

- Less than 300 MB of space is available on the hard disk on which the
  Microsoft Reader software is installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, increase the amount of available hard disk space on your
system hard disk and the hard disk on which the Microsoft Reader software is
installed.

To do this, use the following methods in the order in which they are presented.

Install the Microsoft Reader Software on the System Hard Disk
-------------------------------------------------------------

If the Microsoft Reader software is installed on a hard disk other than the hard
disk on which Windows is installed, uninstall the Reader software and then
reinstall the Reader software on the system hard disk.

NOTE: The default installation folder for the Reader software is

  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Reader

which is the system folder on most computers.

Install the Reader Software on a Different Hard Disk
----------------------------------------------------

If more than one hard disk or hard disk partition is installed in your computer,
install the Reader software on a hard disk that contains at least 300 MB of
available space.

For information about how to determine the amount of available space on each of
your hard disks, please see the "More Information" section of this article.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

11. At the command prompt, type the following lines, pressing ENTER after you
  type each line

  press ENTER to restart Microsoft Windows.
