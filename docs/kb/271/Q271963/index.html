The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start your computer, some services (including but not limited to the
Workstation, Server, WWW, and FTP services) may not start, and Event Viewer may
record the following error message:

  Event ID: 7023 A Duplicate Name Exists on the Network.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur for the following reasons:

- A multihomed computer has the WINS Client [TCP/IP] protocol or the NetBEUI
  protocol enabled on both network adapters.

- Multiple Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) servers are present in the
  network environment, but replication between them is not configured.

- WINS clients are registering with more than one WINS server ("split
  registration").

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, follow these steps:

1. Disable the NetBEUI protocol and the WINS Client [TCP/IP] protocol on the
  external network adapter on the multihomed server.

2. Configure the WINS servers to replicate between themselves.

3. Configure the WINS servers to point to themselves on the WINS Address tab in
  Microsoft TCP/IP Properties.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information about disabling the NetBEUI protocol and the WINS Client
[TCP/IP] protocol on one of your network adapters, please refer to the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

For more information about configuring the WINS Address tab, please refer to the
