To increase the amount of available system resources, quit any unnecessary
programs that are running on your computer before you start Golf 2001 Edition.

  Systray, and then click End Task.

  If you receive a message stating that the program is busy or not responding,

NOTE: Some programs start automatically every time you start your computer. For
information about how to prevent a program from starting automatically, please
see the documentation or the online Help file for the program.

If Golf 2001 Edition is configured to run at a screen resolution higher than 800

To select a lower screen resolution and palette setting in Golf 2001:

1. Start Golf 2001 Edition.

2. On the Startup screen, click Options.

3. Click Advanced, and then click Display Settings.
