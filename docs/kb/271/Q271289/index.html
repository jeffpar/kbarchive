SYMPTOMS
========

When you open an eBook that you purchased online in Microsoft Reader, you may
receive the following error message:

  Activation Error

  You have reached your Activation limit.

CAUSE
=====

The Microsoft Reader software is associated with a Passport account that is
unique to the user of the Reader software. Each Passport account can only be
associated with two Microsoft Reader installations.

You can install Microsoft Reader on up to four machines if you use only one
Passport account. For example, you can install Microsoft Reader on:

- A home computer and a work computer

- A home computer and a laptop or Pocket PC

- Four home computers

Microsoft Reader is associated to your Passport account, and a unique Hardware
ID. This Hardware ID is generated from the volume serial number of the system
hard disk.

If you reformat your hard disk and then reinstall Microsoft Reader, the Reader
software may be unable to be associated with the original passport account
because formatting the hard disk changes the volume serial number of the hard
disk, which changes the unique Hardware ID. As a result, you may receive the
"Activation Error" error message.

For example, you receive this error message if:

- You install Microsoft Reader on two computers and associate Reader with one
  Passport account. You then reformat the hard disk of one computer and attempt
  to associate the Reader software with the original Passport account.

- You install Microsoft Reader on one computer, reformat the hard disk,
  reinstall the Reader software, and associate the Reader software with the
  original passport account. You then repeat this process.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Reader can be activated on as many machines as required but you may
need to associate the Reader software with different Passport accounts. If you
purchase an eBook on a computer on which you associate the Reader software with
your first Passport account, you are unable to read that eBook title on a
computer on which you associate the Reader software with a different Passport
account.

Customers can request more activations at:

NOTE: If you fill out the form and receive an Access Denied message or it loops
back to the same page, locate and click the "click here to submit it for review"
link. Clicking this link submits your request for more activations.
