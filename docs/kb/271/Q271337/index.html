-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 Professional Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you fly the default Boeing 777-300 aircraft in Cockpit view in Microsoft
Flight Simulator 2000, the instrument panel may appear but the view through the
windshield may be entirely black.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if a video adapter based on the Voodoo Banshee chip set
is installed in the computer.

Installing updated video drivers from 3Dfx, the manufacturer of the Voodoo
Banshee chip set, or installing updated video drivers for your video adapter may
not resolve the issue.

Standard troubleshooting steps may also not resolve the issue.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, modify the Panel.cfg file for the Boeing 777-300.

NOTE: Before you modify the Panel.cfg file, make sure that Flight Simulator 2000
is installed in the following folder on your hard disk:

  Program Files\Microsoft Games\FS2000

If the program is installed in a different folder, you must uninstall the program
and then reinstall the program in the default installation folder.

To modify the Panel.cfg file for the Boeing 777-300:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type the following line (including the quotation marks), and
  then click OK

  "&lt;drive&gt;:\program files\microsoft games\fs2000\aircraft\b777_300\panel"

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter of the hard disk on which Flight
  Simulator 2000 is installed.

3. Double-click the Panel.cfg file.

4. In the "Choose the program you want to use" box, click Notepad.

5. Click to clear the "Always use this program to open this file" check box, and
  then click OK.

6. On the Search menu, click Find.

7. In the "Find what" box, type "[Window00]" (without the quotation marks), and
  then click Find Next.

8. Close the Find window.

9. Press the END key.

10. Press ENTER, and then type the following line:

  "render_3d_window=1" (without the quotation marks)

11. On the File menu, click Exit. When you are prompted to save the changes,
  click Yes.
