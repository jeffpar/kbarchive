SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to create a network share point for the installation
of the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) Library.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use the following steps to create an MSDN Library shared install point
on the network.

1. Create a folder on the network that will be available to the client
  computers.

2. Share the folder, and give read permissions to the client computers.

3. Copy all of the files and folders from the MSDN Library Disc 1 to the shared
  folder.

4. Verify that the MSDN331.inf file is in the root of the shared folder.

5. Copy the content of MSDN subfolder of Disc 2 to the MSDN subfolder in the
  shared folder.

6. Copy the MSDN332.inf file from Disc 2 to the root of the shared folder.

7. If the MSDN installation set contains a third CD-ROM, copy the MSDN subfolder
  of Disc 3 to the MSDN subfolder in the shared folder.

8. If the MSDN installation set contains a third CD-ROM, copy the MSDN333.inf
  file from Disc 3 to the root of the shared folder.

9. From the client computer, map a network drive to the shared folder.

10. From the client computer, launch Setup.exe from the root of the mapped
  shared folder.

11. Follow the Installation Wizard instructions. We recommend that you select
  the Typical setup option if the shared folder is to remain available to the
  clients. This setup requires the least amount of hard disk space from the
  client computer. If you do not expect to retain the network installation
  point, then we recommend a full installation because access to the files
  would be lost.

On the MSDN Library January 2000 edition or later, the NetCopy utility
(NetCopy.exe) sets up a network install point. You can run NetCopy.exe from the
MSDN Library Disc 1, and users can connect to the install point and run Setup.
For more information, consult the Readmedn.htm file on the MSDN Library Disc 1.
