-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
- Microsoft OLE DB Provider for Jet, version 4.0 
- Microsoft Access 2.0 
- Microsoft Access 2000 Service Release 1 (SR-1) 
- Microsoft Access 97 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An Access database exists on a Netware 5 Server volume that is running only the
TCP/IP protocol. When you use either Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) or OLE
Provider for Jet, a error message appears that states that the file cannot be
found. There are no errors in the event logs and the ODBC connection tests
successfully.

If you are using ODBC for access, the error message is:

  Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers error '80004005'

  [Microsoft][ODBC Microsoft Access Driver] '(unknown)' is not a valid path.
  Make sure that the path name is spelled correctly and that you are connected
  to the server on which the file resides.

If you are using OLE DB Provider for Jet, the error message is:

  Microsoft JET Database Engine error '80004005'

  'UNC Path Name will be here' is not a valid path. Make sure that the path name
  is spelled correctly and that you are connected to the server on which the
  file resides.

CAUSE
=====

For access to be granted to the Netware File System, credentials must be passed
that have the appropriate rights to the databases you are attempting to access.
By default, the IIS server attempts to pass credentials for the
IUSER_MachineName account.

NOTE: The IWAM_Machine Name account is the account that appears as though it is
being used by IIS 5.0 sites that are being run out-of-process. However, the
IWAM_Machine Name account impersonates the IUSER_Machine Name account.
Therefore, the IUSER account is the only account you are concerned with in this
solution.

Netware uses the Netware Directory Service to authenticate users to its servers.
In order to access any file systems, a legitimate account for the credentials
being passed must exist on the Netware server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To properly communicate with Microsoft Access Databases on a Netware 5 server
running only TCP/IP, please follow these steps exactly:

1. On the IIS server that you want have communicate with Access, install Novell
  Netware Client for Windows NT (Required). During setup, choose a Custom
  Installation, choose to install into a NDS system, and then choose only ip
  for the protocol.

  IMPORTANT NOTE: Do not install Workstation Manager.

2. On the Microsoft Windows 2000 IIS computer:

  a. Under Administrative Tools, open the Computer Management Snap-in.

  b. Under Local Users, select the IUSER_Machine Name account. Right-click and
     choose Set Password.

  c. Change the password, save it, and then close the MMC.

3. In the Internet Services Manager, do the following:

  a. Right-click the server name (for example, MYWEB01) under Internet
     Information Services.

  b. Click the Edit button next to WWW to open the master properties.

  c. On the Directory Security tab, click the Edit button next to Anonymous and
     Authentication methods.

  d. On the Authentication Methods tab, click Edit under the Anonymous section
     to open the Anonymous User properties.

  e. Click to uncheck the option for IIS to control the password, and then
     enter the password that you changed in step 2.

4. Create the ODBC System DSN by using the Microsoft Access Database driver:

   - Under Database, click Select, and then enter the path using Universal
     Naming Convention (UNC) in the database name field to give the DSN a Name.

  -or-

   - Add a OLE DB Provider for Jet Connection String to the asp page that is
     failing. An example of a Access Connection String is:

  set conn = server.CreateObject("ADODB.Connection")
  conn.open "Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source='UNC Path to Netware 5 Goes Here';Persist Security Info=False"

- Open the Netware Administrator found on the sys: volume under Public\WIN32
  folder of the Netware 5 server. In the root of the container at which the
  server exists, create a IUSR_Machine Name account identical to the one that
  is on the NT Server. On the properties of that user, click Password
  Restrictions, and choose to have Require password checked. Click the Set
  Password button, and then set the password to that of the NT account.

  IMPORTANT NOTE: Do not require passwords to be changed on the Netware system.
  This is the most crucial step to the entire process.

5. In Netware Administrator, under the newly created IUSR properties, choose the
  Rights to files and directories tab, and then add the appropriate rights to
  the database files that need to accessed. At the least, READ permissions need
  to be given, unless changes are made through the Internet that require all
  permissions except supervisor and access control.


  Test your application and you should see the data that you are attempting to
  access.

WORKAROUND
==========

If the preceding resolution is not satisfactory, a workaround can be produced
that is typically used in older Netware versions. By using GSNW, a connection to
the Netware 5 server could be established using the IPX/SPX protocol. However,
please note that this requires that IPX be added to the Netware 5 Server as well
as the NT Server.


For installation instructions for the GSNW, please refer to the Windows 2000
End-User Manual.
