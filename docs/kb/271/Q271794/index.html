-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

If you are running RPC-server programs that communicate with their clients over
TCP and/or UDP and you are using dynamic endpoints while under load and
experiencing network problems, you may receive an access violation error message
in Rpcss.exe. When this occurs, you may need to restart the server to work
around this problem.


CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because when information that is stored for datagram RPC
requests is freed, an invalid pointer is freed that causes the access violation
error message.
