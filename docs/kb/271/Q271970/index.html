SYMPTOMS
========

The Cron service may stop unexpectedly after some jobs have been started. When
this occurs, the Cron service reports CreateNamedPipe error 2 or 231. Typically,
the Event log records an entry similar to the following message:

  Event Type: Error
  Event Source: CronService
  Event Category: None
  Event ID: 1001
  Date: 8/5/2000
  Time: 8:57:49 AM
  User: N/A
  Computer: LC2-LFD10
  Description: Cron Service Win32 API CreateNamedPipe failed with the error 2

CAUSE
=====

Cron.exe generates an access violation because of an insufficient error message
buffer and resultant data corruption.
