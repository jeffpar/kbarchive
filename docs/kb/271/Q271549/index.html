-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Because the Olympic Games are scheduled to be held in September, 2000, in
Sydney, Australia, several Australian states (New South Wales, Victoria,
Australian Capital Territory, and Tasmania) have moved the daylight saving time
transition start date forward two months (for the year 2000 only), from the last
Sunday in October to the last Sunday in August.

Programs that are built by using Microsoft Collaboration Data Objects (CDO), such
as Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA), may not correctly reflect this change to
the daylight saving time transition date because CDO maintains an internal table
to track time zone information. This table is not updated with changes that are
made to the operating system time zone.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you install this fix, applications that are written using CDO (such as the
AutoAccept event script) can be updated with the new Sydney year 2000 time
zone.

You need to modify part of the OWA Active Server Pages (ASP) code to enable OWA
users to use the new time zone. In particular, you need to modify the Set.asp
file in the Webdata\Usa\Options folder so the new time zone can be selected on
the Options page. The following is an example of the modifications that need to
be made to the Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3 version of the Set.asp file.

At around line 151, change the following array definition

  Function AmToIdx(n)
      Dim A         '1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35 36 37 38 39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51
      A = Array(-1, 20, 24, 23, 22, 28, 25, 26, 16, 13, 11, 7, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1, 50, 45, 43, 42, 41, 39, 37, 34, 33, 31, 30, 15, 19, 18, 21, 17, 14, 12, 10, 9, 8, 5, 0, 49, 48, 47, 46, 44, 40, 38, 36, 35, 27, 29, 32)
      AmToIdx = A(n)
  End Function

to the following

  Function AmToIdx(n)
      Dim A         '1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35 36 37 38 39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52
      A = Array(-1, 20, 24, 23, 22, 28, 25, 26, 16, 13, 11, 7, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1, 50, 45, 43, 42, 41, 39, 37, 34, 33, 31, 30, 15, 19, 18, 21, 17, 14, 12, 10, 9, 8, 5, 0, 49, 48, 47, 46, 44, 40, 38, 36, 35, 27, 29, 32, 51)
      AmToIdx = A(n)
  End Function

The preceding changes provide for a fifty-second entry in the array "A" with a
value of "51" as the newly reference able time zone.

At around line 451, after the following lines

  &lt;!-- 48 --&gt;&lt;OPTION VALUE="41"&gt;(GMT+11:00) Magadan, Soloman Is., New Caledonia
  &lt;!-- 49 --&gt;&lt;OPTION VALUE="40"&gt;(GMT+12:00) Fiji Is., Kamchatka, Marshall Is.
  &lt;!-- 50 --&gt;&lt;OPTION VALUE="17"&gt;(GMT+12:00) Wellington, Auckland

add a new line as follows

  &lt;!-- 51 --&gt;&lt;OPTION VALUE="52"&gt;(GMT+10:00) Canberra, Melbourne, Sydney, Hobart (Year 2000 only)

This addition makes the new time zone available from the list on the OWA Options
page. After users select this new time zone, subsequent appointments are created
correctly. For additional information, click the article number below to view
