SYMPTOMS
========

The date and time stamp on entries in the IIS log files are incorrect by several
hours.

CAUSE
=====

The selected log file format is the W3C Extended Log File Format. The extended
log file format is defined in the W3C Working Draft WD- logfile-960323
specification by Phillip M. Hallam-Baker and Brian Behlendorf. This document
defines the Date and Time files to always be in GMT. This behavior is by design.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use one of the following resolutions:

Resolution 1:

Change the active logging format to the Microsoft IIS Log File Format. This
format logs in the server's Local Time.

Resolution 2:

Use the Convlog.exe utility, which is located in the Winnt\System32 folder, to
convert the log to the NCSA Log File Format and server's local time. At a
command prompt, type the following:

  convlog -ie LogFileName -t ncsa:+/-GMTOffset

where LogFileName is the name of the file to convert and GMTOffset is the number
of hours to correct.

For example, to convert a file named "Logfile.log," and correct for Eastern
Standard Time, you would use the following command:

  convlog -ie Logfile.log -t ncsa:-0500

You can find complete instructions on how to use the Convlog utility in the IIS
online documentation.

NOTE: This solution does not actually change the time stamps for the log entries.
It enters the GMT offset into each entry, so that anyone reading through the log
can see that the time stamp is not in local time.

The following is an example of a log entry produced by this utility:

  192.168.1.1 - - [30/Jun/2000:20:16:40 -0500] "GET /default.asp HTTP/1.0" 200
  -
