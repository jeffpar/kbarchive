IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry.

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

The DeleteNonActiveServers registry entry that is documented in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base does not appear to work as described when you use the Microsoft
Systems Network Architecture (SNA) Server client for Microsoft Windows NT. For
additional information, click the article number below to view the article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236578 Offline Servers Should Be Removed from Clients' Service Table

After you restart SnaBase on a client computer, an offline server may still be
shown in the list of sponsor servers.

CAUSE
=====

The DeleteNonActiveSponsors registry entry behaves differently on Windows NT
clients compared to Microsoft Windows 95 and Microsoft Windows 98 clients. The
Windows 95 or Windows 98 client removes a sponsor server entry if a server's
SnaBase is not active. However, the Windows NT client only removes the sponsor
server entry if the server's name cannot be resolved to a network address during
the service startup. If the name of the offline server can be resolved, the
entry is not removed.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Remove references to the offline computer from the WINS, DNS, LMHosts, or Hosts
file. The next time the SnaBase service starts up, the sponsor server entry
should be removed. The entry can also be removed manually from the client
configuration either by opening the client configuration and removing the
offline server from the list of sponsor servers or by removing the entry from
the registry. The sponsor server information is located at:

  HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\SNABase\Parameters\Sponsors

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
