The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
- Microsoft Mouse driver for MS-DOS 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Serial Mouse may not work after you exit Microsoft Windows version
3.0 if the mouse is connected to a dedicated mouse port. This information
applies to all versions of the Microsoft Serial Mouse and versions 7.0 through
8.2 of the Microsoft Mouse driver for MS-DOS.

WORKAROUND
==========

If the customer is using PC Tools, try to initialize PCSHELL with a /PS2 switch
as follows:

  pcshell /ps2

If this doesn't work, continue with the troubleshooting steps in this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem may occur even if the MS-DOS version of the mouse driver (MOUSE.COM
or MOUSE.SYS) is correctly loaded into memory on the machine. A designated mouse
port is reset upon entering a MS-DOS application. Upon exit, Windows performs a
"soft reset," but some MS-DOS applications require a "hard reset" of the port.
Consequently, the mouse isn't active in such an application even though the
mouse driver software was installed in memory.

Possible solutions to this problem are as follows:

1. If you are using the Windows mouse driver version 7.04 (MOUSE.DRV, file size
  3699 bytes) with PC Tools, call Central Point Software at (503) 690-8080 and
  request the files FIXWIN.BAT and FIXMOUSE.COM. These files will generate a
  hard reset on the mouse port.

  NOTE: PC Tools is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft. We make
  no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
  reliability.

2. If you plug the mouse into the COM1 or COM2 serial port and the problem
  disappears, there may be a problem with the mouse port other than
  specifically the need for a hard reset. If you plug the mouse into the COM1
  or COM2 serial port and the problem persists, continue with the steps below.

3. In the subdirectory that contains the mouse driver, type "mouse" (without the
  quotation marks). The message "Existing mouse driver enabled" is displayed.
  This causes a hard reset of the mouse port, and the mouse should then work.

4. Update your Windows MOUSE.DRV file to version 8.0 (file size 9216 bytes).
  This reportedly corrects the problem in most cases, but there are known to be
  exceptions. This file comes on the Microsoft Mouse version 8.0 driver update
  disk. To obtain this disk, call Microsoft Sales Information Center (MSIC) at
  (800) 426-9400.
