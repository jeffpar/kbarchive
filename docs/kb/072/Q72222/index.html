SUMMARY
=======

SubApp.exe is a sample that demonstrates how to add menu items to another
Windows-based application to enhance the functionality of an existing
Windows-based application. You can do this by adding new menu items to the
target application. The source application that you use to add the new menu
items can also respond to these menu items when the user selects them.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

To monitor the menu items of another application, the main window of that
application is subclassed using the SetWindowLong() function. In the new window
function, WM_SYSCOMMAND messages should be processed to handle the system menu
items. If the menu items belong to a pop-up menu, WM_COMMAND should be
processed. All the other messages and unrelated menu messages should be passed
to the previous window function to maintain the integrity of the target
application.

After subclassing the target application, new menu items or new pop-up menus can
be added to it. To add menu items to the system menu or an existing pop-up menu,
AppendMenu() is called, and to add new pop-up menus, InsertMenu() is called.

To make this process work in all three modes of Windows, a fixed code
dynamic-link library (DLL) should be used. The DLL should contain the function
that adds menu items and the new window function for the target application.
This is because the code associated with such a mechanism must be available at
all times. Certain EMS (expanded memory specification) memory configurations
place all code except fixed library code segments in application-specific EMS
memory. This makes the code availability limited to the application that owns
the EMS memory. If that code is not available to the target application, it will
crash under those EMS configurations.

NOTE: For future compatibility, the subclass procedure must be in a DLL for all
modes.

Care should be taken when assigning ID (identification) values to the new menu
items. The new ID values should not conflict with the values of the existing
menu items; otherwise, the old menu items will be disabled. To determine the
existing ID values of the target application, use SPY.EXE (included with the
Windows SDK) to monitor WM_MENUSELECT messages when selecting menu items. The
wParam parameter of WM_MENUSELECT message contains the ID value of the menu item
selected.

Some applications, such as Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word for Windows, use
more than one menu; that is, each application has an option to use a long menu
or a short one. These applications also allow their users to customize the
menus. These features could become a problem when subclassing this type of
application and monitoring new pop-up menus or new menu items.

For example, when subclassing Word for Windows, a new menu item is added under
the pop-up menu "Utility". Suppose that, when appending the new item, the long
version of the menu was selected. Later on, if the user changes to the short
version of the menu, the new added menu item will be lost because Word for
Windows would load the short version of its menus. To avoid this problem, add
menu items to the system menu of Word for Windows -- changing the menu version
does not effect the system menu.

Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Word for Windows can also display the menu items
selected in a status window at the bottom. For this purpose, these applications
use the WM_MENUSELECT message. If these applications receive a WM_MENUSELECT for
a menu item that was not originally a part of their menu, they could crash when
they refresh the status window. For this reason, in the new window function,
WM_MENUSELECT messages related to all the new menu items should not be passed to
the target application's old window function.

If there are a lot of new menu items to be added to an application, cascading
menus should be used. Such a menu structure can help minimize the number of
commands on an original pop-up menu of the target application.

As previously stated, there is a sample in the Software Library called SUBAPP
that demonstrates the feature of adding menu items to another Windows-based
application. In WinMain of SUBAPP.EXE, FindWindow() is called to get the handle
of the desired application. If the application is present in the system, its
main-window is subclassed with a new function and two new menu items are
appended to its system menu. The new function monitors the messages of the
target application. If any of those messages relate to the newly added menu
items, the messages are handled accordingly; otherwise, they are sent to the
target application's original function.

If, on the other hand, the application is not present, a message hook is
installed to monitor the execution of the desired application. The message hook
waits for the WM_PAINT message to arrive for the desired window class.

Upon receiving a WM_PAINT for the desired application, the callback hook function
subclasses the other application and appends menu items to its system menu. The
hook function then posts a message to the calling application (SUBAPP.EXE) to
unhook the message filter, since there is no longer a need for a system message
hook.

If the other application quits before the termination of SUBAPP.EXE, a message
hook is set that again waits for the activation of the desired application to
append the menu items. If SUBAPP.EXE is closed before the target application,
the added menu items are removed and the application is no longer subclassed.

The message hook, the subclassing function for the application, and all of the
menu appending and removing calls are placed in a fixed code DLL, called
LIBSUBAP.DLL. This guarantees that SUBAPP.EXE will work properly in all of the
three modes of Windows.

SUBAPP.EXE can be used to subclass any Windows-based application as long as the
class name of the target application's main window is known. In the
application's header file (SUBAPP.H), the constant OTHER_CLASS_NAME can be
initialized to the desired application's main-window class name.
