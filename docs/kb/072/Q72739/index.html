- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system version 5.0

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade Disk 1 contains a program called HDBKUP.EXE. This
utility was designed for backing up hard drives prior to installing the
Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade. Backing up a hard drive is one of the first options
presented when running the MS-DOS 5 Upgrade program. HDBKUP.EXE is not copied to
the DOS directory on the hard drive during installation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

HDBKUP.EXE is not a compressed file and can be copied to the hard drive and run
independently of the MS-DOS version 5.0 installation. HDRSTORE.EXE is not a
compressed file and can also be copied to the hard drive. HDBKUP will only do
full backups of hard disks and can be run under MS-DOS versions 2.11 and later.
Backing up from floppy disks and/or RAM drives is not an option under HDBKUP.
Backups made with HDBKUP can be restored with RESTORE or HDRSTORE. Backups made
with BACKUP.EXE can be restored with HDRSTORE.EXE. HDRSTORE.EXE is located on
the Microsoft MS-DOS 5 Upgrade Disk 2 (720K disk size) or Disk 3 (360K disk
size).

HDBKUP.EXE can format a disk during the backup process, even if FORMAT.COM is not
in the path. HDBKUP can also format different density disks during backup. The
standard BACKUP.EXE cannot do either of these.

The following are the two backup utilities included with MS-DOS 5.0:

  HDBKUP   EXE     42698 04-09-91   5:00a
  BACKUP   EXE     36092 04-09-91   5:00a

Additional query words: 5.00 noupd
