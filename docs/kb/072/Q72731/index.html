-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.1 
- Microsoft Programmer's Workbench for OS/2, versions 1.0, 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When attempting to set a Program List using a makefile generated by the
Programmer's WorkBench (PWB) version 1.0 or 1.1, the following message may be
generated if the makefile has been edited by an editor (other than PWB) that
places a CTRL+Z at the end of the file:

  Error reading program list line xxx
  ':' or '=' expected

If you select the "OK" button in response to this dialog box, another dialog box
will appear, asking if you want to use the makefile as a non-PWB makefile.

CAUSE
=====

Some editors other than PWB or the Microsoft Editor (for example, the OS/2
System Editor) will automatically append a CTRL+Z (end-of-file) character to
every file that is modified. PWB reads this CTRL+Z as a standard character and
expects either a colon (indicating a build rule) or an equal sign (indicating a
macro) to follow it. Finding neither, PWB will return the error above.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you want to make modifications to PWB-generated makefiles, while still
allowing PWB to use them as native makefiles, you should add a "fence" to the
end of the makefile. The fence is a separator line of the following form:

  # &lt;&lt; User_supplied_information &gt;&gt;

The comment marker (#) must begin in the first column, and the line must appear
exactly as shown above. Any information placed below this line is ignored by
PWB, but may still be executed by NMAKE. This method eliminates the possibility
of the CTRL+Z problem described above, as well as ensuring that you retain full
functionality of all PWB menu commands, since PWB never tries to interpret or
modify anything below the fence.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in PWB versions 1.0 and 1.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.
