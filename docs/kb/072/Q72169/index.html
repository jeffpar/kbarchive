MORE INFORMATION
================

8. DOCUMENTATION CORRECTIONS AND ADDITIONS
------------------------------------------

8.1 New CV.COM for CodeView:

Users of CodeView versions 3.0 to 3.13 should use the program CV.COM to start
CodeView. For more details, see the section on CodeView in the file
APPNOTES.TXT.

8.2 Documentation Corrections:

The following are corrections to the "Microsoft MS-DOS User's Guide and
Reference":

COMP /? Help:

  Online help for the COMP command /d switch should state that the default
  format is hexadecimal.

EXPAND Command:

  The example in Chapter 4 of the "Microsoft MS-DOS Getting Started" guide
  refers to the wrong installation and upgrade disks. The disk referred to as
  Disk 1 should be Disk 2; the disk referred to as Disk 2 should be Disk 3.

FORMAT Command:

  If you can't use the FORMAT command to format an unformatted disk, try using
  the /u switch.

MIRROR Command:

  You cannot use the MIRROR command with a network drive or any drive you
  created by using the ASSIGN, SUBST, or JOIN command.

UNDELETE Command:

  Do not use the UNDELETE command in the following circumstances:

- When other programs are active.

- With the LOAD= command or the SHIFT+ENTER key combination in Windows.

- With Task Swapper in MS-DOS Shell.

UNFORMAT Command:

  The UNFORMAT /p switch is not compatible with the /j switch.

8.3 Hercules Display Adapter (MSHERC.COM):

If you use MS-DOS Editor or QBasic with a Hercules display adapter, run
MSHERC.COM before you run either program.

8.4 QBasic "On Error" Command:

Online help for Microsoft QBasic incorrectly states that ON ERROR RESUME NEXT is
a valid statement. The correct syntax is as follows:

  ON ERROR GOTO &lt;LINE/LABEL&gt;

8.5 SMARTDrive and Third-Party Partitions:

If your system includes a third-party disk partition and you try to use
SMARTDrive, you may receive a message stating that you cannot load SMARTDrive.

You can force SMARTDrive to load by specifying the /p switch. However, doing so
may corrupt your hard disk if either of the following conditions is true:

- Your hard disk contains more than 1024 cylinders.

- Your hard disk is not supported by the system's ROM BIOS.

If you have partitions created by using third-party disk-partitioning software,
use SMARTDrive ONLY if you are sure your hard disk contains 1024 or fewer
cylinders AND it is supported directly by the system's ROM BIOS.
