- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you print from Microsoft Windows to the IBM Proprinter X24e or XL24e, a
white line shows through the printed characters. The white line occurs at 11/16
inch intervals.

CAUSE
=====

You have an old EPROM chip in your printer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, replace the EPROM chip in the printer. This upgrade is
available from IBM. The updated EPROM chip ID number is 49F5263. NOTE: You need
to verify that you have the old EPROM.

To verify that an old EPROM is present:

1. Turn off the printer.

2. Make sure that the printer has 8.5-inch or 13-inch paper installed, depending
  upon whether it's a 4207 or a 4208 (narrow or wide carriage).

3. Press and hold the ProPark button.

4. Turn the printer back on.

5. When the printer starts printing, release the ProPark button.

6. Power the printer off after it has printed one page.

7. Locate the seven-digit alphanumeric part number in the upper-left corner of
  the printout.

8. If it is NOT 49F5263 and the printer exhibits the "White Line" problem, IBM
  Service can be called to perform the printer update.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This correction will be performed by IBM on-site. Call IBM service and state
that you need "ECA002" for the IBM 4207 or 4208 printer. The service is provided
at no charge. This does NOT apply to the older X24(4207-001) and XL24(4208-001)
printers but ONLY to the X24E and XL24E printers, which are also called the
4207-002 and 4208-002.

For more information on this subject, query on the following words:

  "Proprinter" (without the quotation marks) and "X24" (without the quotation
  marks) and "XL24E" (without the quotation marks)
