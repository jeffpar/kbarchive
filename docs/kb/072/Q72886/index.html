-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following is a list of documentation additions and corrections for Chapters
1 through 6 of the "Microsoft Macro Assembler Programmer's Guide" for version
6.0. The section and page numbers are listed first, followed by a description of
the addition or correction.

Section 1.2.1, Page 12
----------------------

The following paragraph comes from the README.DOC file included with the MASM 6.0
package. Add the paragraph to the description of reserved words in Section
1.2.1:

  With the /Zm command-line option or OPTION M510, keywords and instructions
  that are not available in the current CPU mode (such as ENTER under .8086)
  are not treated as keywords. The USE32, FLAT, FAR32, and NEAR32 segment types
  and the 80386/486 registers are not keywords with processor selection
  directives less than .386.

Section 3.3.1, Page 75
----------------------

In the sample code at the top of the page, STRUCT PERSON should be PERSON
STRUCT.

Section 3.2.4.1, Page 70
------------------------

Add an additional instruction in the program example shown in the paragraph
titled "Accessing Structure Elements." The example should read:

      .
      .
      .
      mov     bx, OFFSET students
      mov     ax, 4
      mov     di, SIZE STUDENT
      mul     di
      mov     di,ax               ; This line is added. It places the
                                  ; result of the multiply into DI

      mov     al,(STUDENT PTR[bx+di]).year

Section 3.2.4.3, Page 73
------------------------

The example line at the top of page 73 states:

     mov     eax,[ebp*2]     ; EBP base (only - seg SS)

This should read as follows:

     mov     eax,[ebp*2]     ; EBP base (only - seg DS)

The EBP register is treated as an index register because it is scaled, and
therefore the DS register is assumed not SS.

Section 4.1.1, Page 87
----------------------

The table at the top of page 87 incorrectly states that the size of a variable
defined with the DWORD or SDWORD initializer is 3 bytes. This should show that a
variable of size DWORD or SDWORD is 4 bytes, not 3.

Section 4.2.2.1, Page 95
------------------------

The last paragraph on page 95 states:

  If you use these stack values often in your program, you may want to give
  them labels. For example, you can use TEXTEQU to create a label such as count
  TEXTEQU &lt;bp-6&gt;.

This should read:

  If you use these stack values often in your program, you may want to give
  them labels. For example, you can use TEXTEQU to create a label, such as
  "count TEXTEQU &lt;[bp-6]&gt;".

Section 5.2, Page 124
---------------------

The following paragraph should be added to Section 5.2. This addition comes from
the README.DOC file.

  The ALIGN, EVEN, and ORG directives can be used during structure definition
  to modify how offsets of elements are defined. The EVEN and ALIGN directives
  will round the current field offset up to the specified align value by
  inserting padding bytes into the skipped space. The ORG directive may be used
  to change the current field offset to a new value, either positive or
  negative. If the ORG directive is used in a structure definition, you cannot
  create an instance of the structure.

Section 5.2.2, Page 127
-----------------------

Change this line in the first example of Section 5.2.2 "Defining Structure and
Union Variables:"

     ITYPE     UNION

This should be:

     UNION     ITYPE

Section 5.2.2, Page 129
-----------------------

On page 129, the comments in the program example, as well as the last paragraph,
incorrectly state that a literal string cannot initialize a structure field that
is defined with DUP. This statement is incorrect because it can be done.

Additional query words: 6.00 6.00a 6.00b
