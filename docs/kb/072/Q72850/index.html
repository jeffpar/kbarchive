SUMMARY
=======

When installing the Microsoft Source Profiler version 1.0 to work in conjunction
with other Microsoft language products, there are several setup issues that may
need to be addressed to avoid problems or confusion.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The default for the Profiler Setup program is to create the following directory
structure:

  \PROFILER\BIN - MS-DOS/Windows binary and .BAT files
  \PROFILER\BINP - OS/2 protected mode binary and .CMD files
  \PROFILER\HELP - PROFILER.HLP and new PWB.HLP
  \PROFILER\INIT - TOOLS.PRE
  \PROFILER\SAMPLES - Sample files for BASIC, C, FORTRAN, and TAB output

For the Profiler to work correctly with other Microsoft language products, some
of the files in these directories should either be moved or their contents
should be added to existing system files. To ensure your system is configured
correctly, perform the following steps:

1. Move PWBPROF.MXT from the \BIN directory to the directory that contains the
  DOS version of PWB so that it will automatically be loaded along with the
  other extensions.

2. Move PWBPROF.PXT from the \BINP directory to the directory that contains the
  protected mode version of PWB so that it will automatically be loaded along
  with the other extensions.

3. Place PROFILER.HLP and PWB.HLP in a directory pointed to by the HELPFILES
  environment variable. Since it is important to use the new PWB.HLP rather
  than an existing version from a language product, the best method is to copy
  these files from the new \PROFILER\HELP directory to the language \HELP
  directory that contains your existing help files. If you want to conserve
  disk space, you can then then delete the files in the \PROFILER\HELP
  directory.

4. Follow the instructions on pages 9 and 10 of the "Microsoft Source Profiler
  User's Guide" in order to properly configure your system's CONFIG.SYS,
  AUTOEXEC.BAT, STARTUP.CMD, TOOLS.INI, and Windows SYSTEM.INI files.

5. If desired, you can conserve further disk space by deleting the SAMPLES
  directories and files for languages that you do not have or use.
