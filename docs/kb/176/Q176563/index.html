SYMPTOMS
========

With a bound DBGrid control, navigation is often performed with the properties
and methods of the Recordset object of the Data control. After such an
operation, if the vertical scroll bar of the DBGrid control is dragged to the
bottom, the DBGrid control loses all except the last row of data. In addition,
the vertical scroll bar is lost, making it impossible to view the rest of the
rows.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, place the code to ReBind the data in the
RowColChange event of the DBGrid control, as follows:

     Private Sub DBGrid1_RowColChange(LastRow As Variant, _
                                      ByVal LastCol As Integer)
         If DBGrid1.VisibleRows = 1 Then
             DBGrid1.ReBind
             DBGrid1.Scroll 0, Data1.Recordset.RecordCount - _
                               Data1.Recordset.AbsolutePosition
         End If
     End Sub

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this bug and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are several properties and methods of the Recordset object that can be
used to navigate through the rows of a bound DBGrid control.

The properties include:

  AbsolutePosition
  PercentPosition

The methods include:

  FindFirst
  Move
  Seek

For the following illustration, the AbolutePosition property is used.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start Visual Basic and create a new Standard EXE. Form1 is created by
  default.

2. Add a Data control to Form1 and set the following properties: DatabaseName =
  "C:\Program Files\DevStudio\VB\Nwind.mdb" RecordSource = "Customers"

3. Add a DBGrid control to Form1 and set the following properties:

  DataSource = "Data1"

4. Add a CommandButton to Form1 with the following code:

        Private Sub Command1_Click()
        Dim row_count As Long

            'Set the current row to the middle row
            row_count = Data1.Recordset.RecordCount
            Data1.Recordset.AbsolutePosition = row_count / 2

        End Sub

5. Run the project and click on Command1 and note that the middle row is
  selected.

6. Finally, use the vertical scroll bar of the DBGrid control to scroll to the
  bottom and note that all rows are lost except the last row.
