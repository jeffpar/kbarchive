SUMMARY
=======

How to identify differences between the exportable and non-exportable (strong
crypto) versions of Windows NT system files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because of US government regulations that restrict the export of software
containing strong (128-bit) cryptographic algorithms, Microsoft produces two
versions of the North American English service packs. One which implements
strong cryptographic algorithms (128-bit) and is not exportable outside North
America without an export license, and a second version that contains exportable
(40-bit) cryptographic code, which is exportable to most destinations without
restriction.

Because of these governmental export restrictions, no localized versions of
Windows NT are currently available in 128-bit versions. Non-North American
English versions of these files contain only exportable cryptographic code.

In Service Pack 3, the only files that are different between the 40-bit and
128-bit versions of the service packs are:

- Ndiswan.sys
- Ntlmssps.dll
- Schannel.dll
- Security.dll
- Update.inf

Additionally, the 128-bit version also includes Rsaenh.dll.

Perform the following steps to verify the version of the files installed:

1. Start Windows NT Explorer.

2. Right-click the file, click Properties, and then click the Version tab.

3. Note the description.

  40-bit:

     File Name     Description
     -------------------------
     Ndiswan.sys   MS WAN Wrapper Network Driver (Export Version)
     Ntlmssps.dll  NtLm Security Support Provider Service DLL (Export
                   Version)
     Schannel.dll  PCT / SSL Security Provider (Export Version)
     Security.dll  NtLm Security Support Provider Client DLL (Export
                   Version)

  128-bit:

     File Name     Description
     -------------------------
     Ndiswan.sys   MS WAN Wrapper Network Driver (Domestic Use Only)
     Ntlmssps.dll  NtLm Security Support Provider Service DLL (Domestic
                   Use Only)
     Rsaenh.dll    Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider (US/Canada
                   Only, Not for Export)
     Schannel.dll  PCT / SSL Security Provider (US and Canada Use Only)
     Security.dll  NtLm Security Support Provider Client DLL (Domestic
                   Use Only)

Installing 40-bit Service Pack on a 128-bit Windows NT installation will possibly
result in reduced functionality.

Installing 128-bit Service Pack on a 40-bit Windows NT installation will replace
all the files concerning encryption and will make the installation 128bit.

NOTE: The uninstall procedure for Service Pack 4 will retain the 128-bit
schannel.dll but returns all other encryption files to 40-bit versions.


When installing hotfixes that replace any one of these files, you should be sure
to install the correct version of the hotfix to maintain the correct
cryptographic strength.
