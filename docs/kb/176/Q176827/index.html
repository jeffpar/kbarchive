SYMPTOMS
========

When you log on to Windows, there may be no Settings command on the Start menu.
As a result, the Control Panel, Printers, and Taskbar commands may be
unavailable.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if you have restricted family members from changing the
computer settings in Protect It!.

Access to the Control Panel, Printers, and Taskbar commands is restricted by
selecting the To Change Computer Settings check box in Protect It!. If you have
not given any family member the ability to change these settings, the Control
Panel, Printers, and Taskbar commands are unavailable.

RESOLUTION
==========

To give a family member access to the Settings command on the Start menu, follow
these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Microsoft Kids, and then click
  Protect It!.

  NOTE: If you receive the following error message when you try to start Protect
  It!, you must follow the steps in the "More Information" section later in
  this article before you can continue:

  This operation has been cancelled due to restrictions in effect on this
  computer. Please contact your system administrator.

2. Type your Protect It! key, and then click OK.

3. In the Family Members box, click the family member who you want to have
  access to the Settings command.

4. Click Set/Change.

5. Click the To Change Computer Settings check box to clear it.

6. Click Next, and then click Next.

7. Click Finish.

8. Repeat steps 3-7 for each family member who should have access to the
  Settings command.

Before you can access the Control Panel, Printers, or Taskbar command, you must
log on to Windows as a family member who has access to these commands.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can control access to individual programs by selecting the "Limit the family
member to programs selected by the owner below" check box. If you limit access
to the Protect It! program for all family members, including the default user,
you receive an error message when you try to run Protect It!.

To work around this issue, create a shortcut to the Protect It! tool in Control
Panel by following these steps:

1. Right-click the Windows desktop.

2. Point to New, and then click Shortcut.

3. In the Command Line box, type the following line, and then click Next:

  " protect!.cpl " (without the quotation marks)

4. Click Finish.

5. Double-click the new Protect!.cpl shortcut. This starts Protect It!.

To give a family member access to the Settings command on the Start menu, follow
steps 2-7 in the "Resolution" section earlier in this article.
