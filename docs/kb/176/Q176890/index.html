SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use the point-of-view (POV) controls assigned to
the hat switch on your joystick or to certain keys on the keyboard.

In Flight Simulator 98, you can use the hat switch on your joystick to rotate the
view in a 360-degree panorama around the cockpit of your aircraft.

NOTE: This can cause confusion in a normal cockpit view window, because the
control panel in normal cockpit view always remains in front of you. This can
create the illusion that the aircraft is changing direction with the view when
the aircraft actually remains on the original heading.

In Flight Simulator 95, when you use the POV hat button, you can rotate your view
up to a 90-degree angle to the plane.

You can also use keyboard commands to switch between views and to resume normal
view in Flight Simulator. The keyboard commands used to change views are listed
in the "More Information" section later in this article. The basic commands are
the same for both Flight Simulator 98 and Flight Simulator 95; however, there
are more commands for Flight Simulator 98 to allow for the 360-degree panorama
option.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The POV hat button movements and keyboard commands that can be used to switch
views in Flight Simulator 98 and Flight Simulator 95 are listed below.

NOTE: When you type the keyboard commands listed below, you must use the number
keys on the numeric keypad on your keyboard.

Flight Simulator 98
-------------------

Cockpit and Virtual Cockpit views:

The following table shows how to use the hat switch on your joystick to change
your view direction when you are in Cockpit view or Virtual Cockpit view:

  Pan down         Hat switch down
  Pan left         Hat switch left
  Pan right        Hag switch right

NOTE: When you are in Cockpit view, the aircraft control panel always remains in
front of you when you use the hat switch to change the direction of your view.
This behavior does not occur when you are in Virtual Cockpit view or when you
use the keyboard to change the direction of your view.

The following table lists the keys or key combinations you need to press to
change your view direction when you are in Cockpit view or Virtual Cockpit view,
depending on whether the NumLock feature on your keyboard is turned off or on:
