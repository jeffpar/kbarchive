-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use the rudder control for your game controller in Flight
Simulator 98 it may not function properly, even though the rudder control
functions properly when you use the Game Controllers tool in Control Panel to
calibrate and test your game controller.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following troubleshooting methods.

Disable Auto-Coordination
-------------------------

The Auto-Coordination feature in Flight Simulator 98 disables the rudder
controller. If the game does not respond when you use the rudder controls for
your game controller, Auto-Coordination may be enabled. To disable
Auto-Coordination, follow these steps:

1. Start a new flight in Flight Simulator 98.

2. On the Aircraft menu, click Aircraft Settings.

3. On the Realism tab, click to clear the Auto-Coordination check box.

4. Click OK.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Reset the Default Game Controller Actions:
------------------------------------------

To reset the default actions in Flight Simulator, follow these steps:

1. Start a new flight in Flight Simulator 98.

2. On the Options menu, click Custom Controls.

3. Click the Assignments tab.

4. Under the Game Device column, click any command to select it.

5. Click Reset Defaults, and then click Yes.

6. To check if the default actions are selected for your 4-axis game controller,
  verify that the the game device settings for the control axes in the game
  match the settings in the following table:

  Action          Game Device
  ---------------------------

  Ailerons axis   Axis 01
  Elevator axis   Axis 02
  Rudder axis     Axis 04
  Throttle axis   Axis 03

  If the default actions are not selected, repeat steps 4-5, or follow these
  steps to assign the default actions manually:

  a. Under the Game Device column, click to select the line for an action you
     want to assign to a game device command, and then click Assign.

     NOTE: When you click Assign, the blue line in the Game Device column
     becomes a white box, and you have five seconds to assign the selected
     action to a game controller command.

  b. On the game controller, press the button or move the axis you want to use
     for the selected action. If you receive a warning message that a different
     action is already assigned to the game controller button or axis, click
     OK.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Calibrate the Joystick in Flight Simulator
------------------------------------------

To calibrate the joystick in Flight Simulator 98, follow these steps:

1. Start a new flight in Flight Simulator 98.

2. On the Options menu, click Custom Controls.

3. Click to select the Enable Joystick check box, and then click Calibrate.

4. Follow the instructions on the screen to calibrate your game controller.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Disable Sound in Flight Simulator 98
------------------------------------

To determine if there is a problem with the sound card or sound driver, disable
the sound in Flight Simulator 98. To do this, press the Q key.

If the issue is resolved when you disable sound in the game, contact your sound
card manufacturer for information about how to obtain and install an updated
driver for your sound card.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Reduce Sound Playback Quality
-----------------------------

If the issue is resolved when you disable sound in the game, your sound card may
be unable to properly process game port signals and high quality game sounds at
the same time. If so, you may be able to work around the issue by reducing the
sound playback quality in the game. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

2. In the Named box, type "fltsim98.cfg" (without the quotation marks), and then
  click Find Now.

3. In the list of found files, double-click the Fltsim98.cfg file.

4. In the "Choose the program you want to use" box, double-click Notepad.

5. Scroll to the end of the file, press ENTER twice, and then type the following
  lines, pressing ENTER after each line:

  [SOUND]
  Channels=1
  SamplesPerSec=11025

6. On the File menu, click Exit. When you are prompted to save the changes,
  click Yes.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Configure the Game Controller as a Different Device
---------------------------------------------------

Use the Game Controllers tool in Control Panel to configure your game controller
as a different device. For example, set the joystick up as a 3-axis, 4-button
joystick or as a CH Virtual Pilot, and then click the Rudder/Pedals check box to
enable the option before you calibrate the device.

NOTE: You cannot configure any Microsoft SideWinder gaming device as a different
device except the SideWinder Standard or the SideWinder 3D Pro.

For example, to set up a SideWinder 3D Pro joystick as a 3-axis 4-button joystick
with Rudder/Pedals, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Game Controllers, and then click Microsoft SideWinder 3D Pro.

3. Click Remove, and then click Yes.

4. Click Add, click 3-Axis, 4-Button Joystick, and then click OK.

5. Click Properties.

6. On the Settings tab, click to select the Rudder/Pedals check box.

7. Click Calibrate, and then follow the instructions on the screen to calibrate
  the game controller.

  NOTE: Axis 3 is the throttle control, and axis 4 is the rudder control.

8. Click Test to verify that the game controller functions properly.
