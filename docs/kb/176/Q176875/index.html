SUMMARY
=======

Earlier versions of the Visual SourceSafe did not provide a method for archiving
parts of Visual SourceSafe databases. The only way to free up space was to
destroy a file or project. Furthermore, there was no way to move information
between databases. The archive utilities Ssarc.exe and Ssrestor.exe are separate
command-line utilities that allow you to do the following:

1. Archive a file or project out of the database into a special compressed file,
  then restore it later with its history, Share Links, and other information
  intact.

2. Archive specific versions of a file (for example, all versions prior to 3.1),
  thus freeing up the space they use in the database, and then restore them to
  the database later.

3. Archive a file, project or project tree from one database and restore it into
  a different database.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The archive utilities Ssarc.exe and Ssrestor.exe are separate command-line
utilities that allow you to do the following:

1. Archive a file or project out of the database into a special compressed file,
  then restore it later with its history, Share Links, and other information
  intact.

  A syntax example of this is:

        C:\&gt;"C:\Program Files\DevStudio\Vss\Win32\SSARC" -d- -i- -sD:\VSSTest
        Archive.ssa $/ 

  The quotes are only necessary if a space exists in the command line. The -d-
  option is an instruction not to delete the files being archived from the
  original database. The -i- option is an instruction for no input (accept all
  defaults). The -s switch specifies a path to the Srcsafe.ini and the data
  directory.

2. Archive specific versions of a file (for example, all versions prior to 5),
  thus freeing up the space they use in the database, and then restore them to
  the database later.

  For example, if the files in the project are at least version 20 and you want
  to archive old versions that are no longer needed, the you could use the
  following syntax to accomplish this:

        C:\&gt;"C:\Program Files\Devstudio\Vss\Win32\SSARC" -v10 -sD:\VSSTest
        Archive.ssa $/Queries/Test

  Because the -d- and -i- options where not specified, the user will be prompted
  to answer the questions:

  Delete archived information from database?(Y/N)
  File C:\archive.ssa already exists. Overwrite?(Y/N)

  NOTE: In general, the archive utility is inclusive. That is, in the above
  example, the created archive (Archive.ssa) contains version 10 and everything
  before it. If you are using a label, and the label has a space in it, you
  must add an end quote to the entire option (for example, "-vThis One").

3. Archive a file, project or project tree from one database and restore it into
  a different database. You could use the following syntax to restore the
  Archive.ssa (from example one above) from the VSSTest database to another
  database called VSSTest2:

       C:\&gt;"C:\Program Files\Devstudio\Vss\Win32\SSRESTOR" -sD:\VSSTest2
       Archive.ssa $/Queries/Test
