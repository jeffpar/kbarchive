The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Windows NT 4.0 Enterprise Server comes with a variety of installable components.
Each additional component is normally installed through the Microsoft Windows NT
Server, Enterprise Edition Installer application.

The following parameters can be passed to the Setup.exe file for Microsoft
Cluster Server (MSCS) to achieve a silent or unattended installation of the MSCS
product. MSCS is located on CD Disc 2 of the Windows NT 4.0 Enterprise Edition
in the directory MSCS.

  -uninstall
   Removes cluster software.

  -u
   Unattended installation of MSCS.

  -join CLUSTERNAME
   Join an existing cluster.

  -name CLUSTERNAME
   Form a new cluster.

  -ipaddr xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
   Set cluster IP Address (for Administrative use).

  -subnet xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
   Subnet mask based on IP address used with -ipaddr.

  -account ACCOUNTNAME
   Specifies the account used to start the cluster service.

  -password PASSWORD
   Set password for the account specified with -account.

  -domain DOMAINNAME
     Domain name that owns the account specified by -account.

  -excludedrive X:
   Exclude Specified drive letter from cluster use.

  -quorum X:
  Set quorum disk to specified drive on the shared SCSI bus.

  -network AdapterName NetName Role

Repeat for each adapter installed in the computer.

AdapterName - The ServiceName assigned to the adapter in the registry. The
ServiceName can be located in

HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkCards&lt;x&gt;

- NetName - Specifies name that indicates the purpose of the network (private,
  client, and so forth)

- Role - 0-All, 1-Internal, 2-Client

NOTE: MSCS requires that Windows NT Server Enterprise Edition version 4.0 and
Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 be installed prior to the installation of MSCS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The entire command line is contiguous and all parameters must be specified. The
parameters -name and -join are mutually exclusive and -excludedrive is
optional.

  setup.exe -u -name &lt;Cluster_Name&gt; -ipaddr &lt;xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx&gt;
  -subnet xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -account &lt;Account_Name&gt; -password &lt;Password&gt;
  -domain &lt;Domain_Name&gt; -excludedrive &lt;x:&gt; -quorum &lt;x:&gt;
  -network &lt;Adapter_Name&gt; &lt;Network_Name&gt; &lt;Role&gt;

The following example may be copied to a batch file and the required information
modified to fit the particular environment being used.

For example:

  setup.exe -u -name NEWCLUSTER -ipaddr 175.3.2.1 -subnet 255.255.255.0
  -account installer -password password -domain CLUSDOMAIN
  excludedrive E: -quorum D: -network E100B1 PUBLICNET 0

The example above will create a new cluster called NEWCLUSTER and sets the
administrative IP address to 175.3.2.1 with a subnet of 255.255.255.0. The
account that will start the MSCS service is INSTALLER and the password for the
account is PASSWORD. The account INSTALLER belongs to the domain CLUSDOMAIN.
There are two drive letters available to the Cluster Server, drives D: and E:.
Drive E: has been excluded and D: is going to be used for the Quorum drive. The
Network option uses the ServiceName for the Intel 10/100B adapter which, in this
example, is E100B1. The Name for the network used by the Intel adapter is
PUBLICNET and the role of the adapter is for both public and private
communications.

Microsoft Windows NT Server Enterprise Edition version 4.0 may be deployed using
normal deployment/unattended methods outlined in the Windows NT 4.0 Deployment
Guide.
