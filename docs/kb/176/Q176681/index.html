The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft has released Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5. This article
describes the new features that are included with this version of Microsoft
Exchange Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Scalability
-----------

The following scalability features are included:

- Unlimited message storage: The size of the public and private information
  stores and the directory is limited only by the amount of free space on your
  hard disk.

- Deleted item recovery: Deleted objects are cached for a period of time that
  you specify. While an object is in the cache, you can recover it. Cached
  objects are not included in storage quota calculations.

- Backup performance improvements: The application programming interface (API)
  used during backups is improved. With the appropriate hardware, you may be
  able to back up as much as 30 gigabytes (GB) of data per hour.

Internet Support
----------------

The following Internet-related features are included:

- Internet Message Access Protocol version 4 (IMAP4) support: This allows IMAP
  clients to send and receive mail through a Microsoft Exchange Server
  computer.

- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) version 3 support: This allows
  LDAP clients with the appropriate permissions to modify directory objects. It
  also allows you to synchronize directories using LDAP.

- Internet security using Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME)
  and X.509 version 3: Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 supports the S/MIME and
  X.509 version 3 certificate standards. This allows you to send encrypted
  messages over the Internet to anyone who is using an e-mail client that
  supports S/MIME.

- Additional Internet support: Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 supports many
  other common Internet technologies, including Multipurpose Internet Mail
  Extensions Hypertext Markup Language (MHTML), the ETRN command, and bulk
  mailing headers.

- Active Messaging enhancements: Including full calendar support for the Web
  client and design time controls and wizards to make it easier to develop
  solutions.

Collaboration
-------------

The following collaboration features are included:

- Event scripting: Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 includes a server-based
  scripting service that support JavaScript, VBScript, and most other common
  scripting languages used to create collaboration programs.

Multiple Organization Hosting
-----------------------------

The following multiple organization hosting features are included:

- Virtual organization support: Administrators are able to create virtual
  organizations by creating multiple address containers and exposing them only
  to the users in that organization.

Security
--------

The following security features are included:

- Enhanced security management: Including a Key Management (KM) server
  installation program that is integrated with the Microsoft Exchange Server
  installation program, bulk enrollment of users and distribution of
  certificates, and multiple password validation for administrators.

Management
----------

The following management features are included:

- Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) support: Allows Performance Monitor
  counters to be packaged with the Request for Comments (RFC) 1566
  specification and used with an SNMP monitor.
