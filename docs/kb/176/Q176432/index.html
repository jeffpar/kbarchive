SUMMARY
=======

When using SNA Server 3.0, which supports dynamic partnership of local and
remote APPC LU's to an APPC mode (in other words, LU/LU/mode partnership), it's
not necessary to preconfigure LU/LU/mode partnership in the SNA Server
configuration file in order to use these LU's. Under SNA Server 2.x, all APPC LU
partnerships had to be defined ahead of time using SNA Admin before the LU's
could be used.

NOTE: The SNA Server 3.0 and 3.0 SP1 Manager tool does not support the ability to
configure LU/LU/mode partnerships, though this feature has been reimplemented in
3.0 Service Pack 2 within the APPC mode definition. The Snacfg.exe command line
tool has always supported the ability to define LU/LU/mode partnerships.

In most cases, explicit LU/LU/mode partnerships do not have to be defined. If
APPC LU/LU/mode partnerships are not defined in the SNA Server 3.0 configuration
file, LU6.2 session activation is deferred. This can cause the following
problems or side effects:

1. APPC or CPIC applications which attempt to allocate an LU6.2 conversation
  without waiting for an LU6.2 session to be activated may fail to allocate a
  conversation. An example of such an application is the Sybase/MDI DB2
  Database Gateway.

  See below for more information about this failure.

2. APPC applications which rely on LU6.2 session information to be returned by
  the APPC DISPLAY verb may fail to work. An example of such an application is
  IBM CICS for Windows NT and Windows 95. For more information about this
  problem, see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q171994 IBM CICS For Windows NT Stops Working On SNA Server 3.0

3. If an APPC mode is configured with any autoactivated sessions, LU6.2 sessions
  do not activate until the first APPC/CPIC application requests a conversation
  over an APPC LU/LU pair and requests this APPC mode. This simply defers LU6.2
  session autoactivation, which is typically configured to force session
  activation when SNA Server starts. By autoactivating an LU6.2 session, this
  can improve performance for the first APPC or CPIC application which attempts
  to allocate a conversation over this LU/LU/mode partnership.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The local and remote LU's defined in SNA server work in pairs. The local APPC LU
is assigned to a server and the remote APPC LU is assigned to the connection.
SNA Server uses dynamic partnering to create any possible LU partnerships on
demand when local and remote LU's and modes recognize each other.

With dynamic APPC partnering, an administrator configures remote LU's, but
normally does not need to partner them with local LUs. SNA Server will
automatically partner the LUs when needed.

APPC applications, such as Sybase/MDI DB2 Gateway, rely on availability of auto-
started APPC conversations on LU to LU pairs. Such applications typically use
the Allocate qualifier AP_IMMEDIATE (which is described in the APPC Programmer's
reference) to open a conversation only if one of the auto-activated
conversations is available for use; these applications will not cause an
additional conversation to be allocated. To support applications which specify
the AP_IMMEDIATE qualifier, the LU pairs should be partnered manually.

If an APPC application which specifies the AP_IMMEDIATE qualifier does not have
the Local and Remote LU's explicitly partnered with a mode , it will fail to
build a conversation to the remote TP and post the following error message in
the NT Event log from where the application is running.

APPC local conversation start failed:

  Primary_rc   = 0014 (AP_UNSUCCESSFUL)
  Secondary_rc = 00000000
  TP_ID        = 0000000080097F00
  Dest TP name = D9C5C3E5E3D7
  LU alias     = SENDLU
  PLU alias    = RECVLU
  Mode name    = 7BC9D5E3C5D94040

EXPLANATION
An attempt to start an APPC conversation locally using the verb [MC_]ALLOCATE
failed.

The SNA trace utility is a tool that can be used to track the activities of the
API's being issued by the application and therefore can be used to determine
which qualifier is specified in the Allocate or Send_Conversation verb posted by
the invokeable TP. Please see the SNA Server Administration guide for details on
how to perform an APPC application trace.

The return control qualifier which is specified by the TP can be located at
offset 28 from the beginning of the request. See Figure 1 below. In this case, a
0x01 is specified, which represents the AP_IMMEDIATE constant. Figure 2 depicts
other qualifier which can be used here as well. The example here is using the
mapped conversation type.
