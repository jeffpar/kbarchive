SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft has made available to the public debugging symbols to aid in the
identification of bugs within Microsoft Visual Basic 5.0 with Visual Studio SP2
applied. Debugging symbols allow debugging tools like Visual C++ and Dr. Watson
to obtain stack traces describing the functions within built components, such as
Msvbvm50.dll, which are being called when a crash occurs. These traces aid
Microsoft in diagnosing problems that cannot be easily reproduced on other
systems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  Vb5sp2ds.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/vb50ent/Sample29/1/W9XNT4/EN-US/Vb5sp2ds.exe)

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

To install the debugging symbols, you first must extract them from Vb5sp2ds.exe.
When you run the Vb5sp2ds.exe, it will prompt you for a directory in which to
extract the files. When the extraction process is complete, there will be two
sub-directories containing the debugging symbol files. These files all have a
.dbg file extension.

The .dbg files in the "x86" directory are for debugging Visual Studio Service
Pack 2 on Intel platforms. The .dbg files in the "Alpha" directory are for
debugging Visual Studio Service Pack 2 on the Alpha platform.

Different debugging tools have different methods of locating debugging symbols.
Usually, you can put a DBG file in the same directory as the .exe, .dll, or .ocx
for which it applies and a debugging tool will find it. For instance, if
MSVBVM50.DLL is in C:\Winnt\System32 directory, you can copy Msvbvm50.dbg to
C:\Winnt\System32 and most debugging tools will locate it. You should consult
your debugging tool documentation for more information on installing debugging
symbols so that the tool can use them.

All the .dbg files in Vb5sp2ds.exe include only Common Object File Format (COFF)
debugging symbols. To use them with Visual C++ 5.0, you must copy Symcvt.dll
from your Visual C++ CD-ROM to your Windows system directory. Drwtsn32.exe that
comes with NT can understand the COFF debugging symbols without Symcvt.dll.
