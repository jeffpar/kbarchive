This article lists frequently asked questions about mail migration on MSN,
The Microsoft Network.

SUMMARY
=======

1. Q: What is mail migration?

  A: Mail migration is the process of configuring your MSN e-mail account to use
  an Internet based e-mail client that uses Post Office Protocol (POP3) and
  Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP) e-mail servers. These e-mail servers
  are faster and more reliable, and support Multipurpose Internet Mail
  Extensions (MIME) encoded file attachments, so it is easier to send and
  receive documents over the Internet.

2. Q: How do I know if my MSN e-mail account has already been migrated?

  A: To verify that your MSN e-mail account has already been migrated, use the
  following steps:
  1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click People.

  2. In the Look In box, click MSN.

  3. In the Name box, type your first and last name, and then click Find Now.

  4. If the MSN Sign-In screen appears, click Connect. If your e-mail address
     is listed as &lt;Member_ID&gt;@email.msn.com, your MSN e-mail account has
     already been migrated.

3. Q: Why did my e-mail address change to &lt;Member_ID&gt;@email.msn.com?

  A: After mail migration, your e-mail address has not changed. You may continue
  to use &lt;Member_ID&gt;@msn.com as your e-mail address. However, when you
  use &lt;Member_ID&gt;@email.msn.com as your e-mail address, your e-mail
  messages travel more quickly over the Internet and are often received in less
  time.

4. Q: How can I migrate my MSN e-mail account?
  A: To migrate your MSN e-mail account, you can use any of the following
  methods for your version of Windows:

  Microsoft Windows 95
  --------------------

  If you are using Windows 95, you can use any of the following methods to
  migrate your MSN e-mail account:

  Method 1
  --------

  The first time you connect to MSN after you install MSN 2.5, you are prompted
  to use Microsoft Internet Mail. Click the Use Internet Mail link to migrate
  your MSN e-mail account.

  Method 2
  --------

  Navigate to the following Web page on MSN

  http://setup.msn.com/membersonly/config/default.asp

  follow the instructions to automatically migrate and configure your MSN e-mail
  account.

  Method 3
  --------

  If you are temporarily unable to connect to MSN, use the following steps to
  migrate your MSN e-mail account:
  1. Insert the MSN CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive. If the Auto Insert
     Notification option is turned on, close the Welcome To MSN window that
     opens on the desktop.

  2. Double-click My Computer.

  3. Right-click the MSN (CD-ROM drive) icon, and then click Explore.

  4. Double-click the Msnsetup folder.

  5. Double-click the Compnts folder.

  6. Double-click the Coreui.exe file. Follow the instructions on the screen,
     and accept all default settings.

  7. Close all open windows, and then restart the computer.

  Microsoft Windows 98
  --------------------

  If you are using Windows 98, install the version of MSN provided with Windows
  98 to migrate your MSN e-mail account.

5. Q: I've installed MSN 2.5, and signed up for a new MSN account. Do I still
  need to migrate my MSN e-mail account?

  A: No, because all new MSN members automatically have their MSN e-mail
  accounts configured to use Internet Mail.

6. Q: I've downloaded Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0, and am unable to send or
  receive e-mail using Microsoft Outlook Express. How can I send and receive
  e-mail using Outlook Express?

  A: To send and receive e-mail using Outlook Express you must have the newest
  version of MSN, version 2.5.

  For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q174810 Can I Use Outlook Express Without Upgrading to MSN 2.5?

7. Q: Why can't I switch back to Microsoft Exchange (Inbox) or Microsoft Outlook
  after migrating to Internet Mail?

  A: After you migrate to Internet Mail, your MSN e-mail account is moved to the
  new POP3 e-mail servers. Past e-mail configurations using Microsoft Exchange
  (Inbox) or Outlook attempt to access your MSN e-mail account on the old MAPI
  servers. Since your MSN e-mail account no longer exists on the MAPI servers,
  you are unable to send or receive e-mail.

  NOTE: To use Outlook 97 after mail migration, you must install the Internet
  Mail Enhancement Patch (IMEP).
