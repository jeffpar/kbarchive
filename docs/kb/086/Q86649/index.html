SUMMARY
=======

The MS-DOS RECOVER command does not rename or move files. Recovered files are
only renamed (and often moved) when RECOVER is used on an entire drive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

RECOVER is essentially two different utilities. One utility recovers readable
information from a file that contains one or more unreadable, or bad, sectors.
The other uses the file allocation table (FAT) to create a new root directory
when the old root directory is corrupt. You essentially choose which utility to
use when you specify that RECOVER should act on a file or on a drive.

RECOVER is discussed on pages 145 and 146 of "The Microsoft MS-DOS User's Guide
and Reference" version 5.0 manual. The following statement is from page 145:

  When the operation is complete, MS-DOS stores the recovered file in the root
  directory of the disk it came from. MS-DOS names the recovered files
  sequentially, beginning with FILE0001.REC.

From the context of the discussion on pages 145 and 146, it would appear that
this paragraph applies to RECOVER in both cases. However, this paragraph does
not apply when using RECOVER on a file; it only applies when using RECOVER on a
drive.

For more information on RECOVER, query on the following words in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  "recover" (without the quotation marks) and "chains" (without the quotation
  marks) and "bad" (without the quotation marks)
