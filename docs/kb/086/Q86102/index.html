The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article lists and explains all the entries in the Microsoft Mail for
Windows private profile, MSMAIL.INI, that are contained in the [Providers]
section.

[Providers]

Logon=&lt;DLL name&gt;
----------------

This entry identifies a single DLL that contains the logon and session management
code for your mail system. It is often, but not necessarily, the same as the
Transport and Name entries. You should enter the base name of the DLL, without
the .DLL extension. You may prefix a path if the DLL is not in a directory on
your MS-DOS path or in the Mail executable directory.

The default value is MSSFS.

Name=&lt;DLL names&gt;
----------------

This entry identifies one or more DLLs that contain functions required to browse
system and personal user lists. One of the values is often, but not necessarily,
the same as the Logon and Transport entries. You should enter base names of the
DLLs, separated by blanks, without the .DLL extension. You may prefix a path if
the DLLs are not in a directory on your MS-DOS path or in the Mail executable
directory.

The order of providers in this entry is significant. When Mail resolves ambiguous
names typed into a message, if it finds an exact match in the first provider in
the list, it will not go on to query the rest. Placing the personal address book
provider first can save time in that process.

The default value is MSSFS PABNSP.

SharedFolders=&lt;DLL name&gt;
------------------------

This entry identifies a single DLL that contains functions required to read and
write messages in Microsoft PC Mail shared folders. It is unlikely that any DLL
other than MSSFS will have this functionality.

The default value is MSSFS.

Transport=&lt;DLL name&gt;
--------------------

This entry identifies a single DLL that contains the functions necessary to send
and receive mail on your mail system. It is often, but not necessarily, the same
as the Logon and Name entries. You should enter the base name of the DLL,
without the .DLL extension. You may prefix a path if the DLL is not in a
directory on your MS-DOS path or in the Mail executable directory.

The default value is MSSFS.
