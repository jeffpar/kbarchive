-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows version 3.1, Setup may return the following error while
trying to copy the SETUP.INF file from Disk 1 of the Windows disks to the hard
drive:

  The version of the SETUP.INF file on your system is not valid for use with
  this version of SETUP.EXE. If you continue, Windows may not run properly. It
  is recommended that you quit Setup and then copy SETUP.INF from Windows disk
  number 1 to your Windows SYSTEM directory. Press ENTER to continue Setup.
  Press F3 to quit Setup now.

CAUSE
=====

The above error message may be caused by one of the following:

- There is an earlier and possibly corrupt Windows version or incompatible OEM
  version of the SETUP.INF file on the hard disk. If MS-DOS version 5.0 is
  installed on the machine, type the following command from the drive C MS-DOS
  command prompt to search for other versions of this file:

  dir setup.inf /s

  Rename any pre-existing SETUP.INF files that are found.

- The SETUP.INF file is corrupt. Try copying the SETUP.INF file from Disk 1 to
  the Windows SYSTEM subdirectory. If the SETUP.INF file is damaged on the
  Setup disk, it will not copy successfully.

- There is not enough memory on the machine to read the SETUP.INF file. This
  error message may be returned on systems having only 640K base plus 1024K
  extended memory. Remove memory resident programs and devices from the
  CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files and then try Setup again. Memory may need
  to be added to the machine before setting up Windows.
