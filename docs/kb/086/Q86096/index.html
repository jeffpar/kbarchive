SUMMARY
=======

This article lists and explains all the entries in the Microsoft Mail for
Windows private profile, MSMAIL.INI, that are contained in the [Custom Messages]
section.

[Custom Messages]

This section may contain any number of entries of complicated form, similar in
many ways to the custom command section. Each entry specifies a custom message
type that is installed into a Mail menu at run time. This section may appear
both in the usual location MSMAIL.INI in your Windows directory and in
SHARED.INI in the directory pointed to by the SharedExtensionsDir entry of
MSMAIL.INI. Here are a synopsis and a couple of examples of the custom message
entry format; a description of each sub field follows. Each entry must occupy a
single line. Many subfields are optional.

class=version;menu;name;position;DLL name;command;operation map;status text;help
file;help context;

  class           A string uniquely identifying the message type.
                  Mail places this string in messages, and calls
                  custom message DLLs based on its value.

  version         Identifies the version of Mail with which the
                  custom message is compatible; 3.2 is the current
                  version.

  menu            Names the menu to which the compose command for the
                  message type should be added, such as File or Mail.

  name            The command name that is to appear on the menu. As
                  usual, you may include an ampersand (&amp;) just before
                  the letter that is to serve as an ALT-key
                  accelerator.

  position        The zero-relative position within its menu at which
                  the command should appear. -1 places the command at
                  the end of the menu.

  DLL name        Name or path of the DLL in which the custom command
                  resides.

  command         Command string passed as one of the parameters to
                  the DLL entry point for the command.

  operation map   Sequence of up to 16 digits. Each can be 0, 1, or 
                  2. 0 indicates that Mail should perform its
                  standard operation on the custom message. 1
                  indicates that the DLL should be called to handle
                  the operation. 2 indicates that the operation
                  should be completely disabled. Currently eight
                  operations are defined; the rest are reserved and
                  must be zero. In the following list, 0 is the
                  leftmost digit:

                  0  Compose (menu command defined in this entry)
                  1  File.Open
                  2  Mail.Reply
                  3  Mail.Reply to All
                  4  Mail.Forward
                  5  File.Print
                  6  File.Save as
                  7  arrival of new mail

  status text     Text to be displayed in the Mail status bar when
                  the user cursors to the command in the menu.

  help file       Windows Help file to be invoked when the user
                  presses F1 while the command is selected. Passed
                  to the Windows Help program.

  help context    Passed to the Windows Help program along with the
                  Help file name. Use -1 (Help file index) if there
                  is no specific entry in the Help file for this
                  command.

A more detailed description of custom message creation and installation can be
found in the Microsoft Mail "Technical Reference."
