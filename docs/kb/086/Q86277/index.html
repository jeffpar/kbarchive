SUMMARY
=======

The purpose of the MIDI Mapper is to provide a way to customize your MIDI setups
to meet the specific needs of your MIDI systems. Some software products have the
ability to bypass the MIDI Mapper. These software packages allow you to bypass
the MIDI Mapper by changing a software setting.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Cakewalk, for example, can be configured to use the MIDI Mapper or bypass it. To
configure Cakewalk to use the MIDI Mapper, do the following:

1. Start Cakewalk for Windows.

2. From the Settings menu, choose Midi Devices.

3. Select the MIDI Mapper.

Determining If MIDI Mapper Is Being Bypassed
--------------------------------------------

To determine if the MIDI Mapper is being bypassed by any application:

1. In the Control Panel window, choose the MIDI Mapper icon.

2. Choose the Setups command button.

3. Choose the Edit button.

4. Clear the Active check box for each of the active ports, except for one
  channel that the MIDI device is capable of accepting. Most devices will allow
  for channel 1 at minimum.

5. Choose the OK button to save the changes.

6. Start the Media Player from the Accessories group.

7. Play a file from the Media Player (CANYON.MID for example). The Media Player
  should play sounds for the one active port only; therefore the sound output
  should be fairly quiet. If the output is quiet, the MIDI Mapper is
  functioning correctly.

8. Start a third-party application.

9. Play a file (CANYON.MID for example). If the third-party application plays
  all channels, just as it did before you disabled all but one channel, the
  third-party application is bypassing the MIDI Mapper.

For information on configuring your third-party application to use the MIDI
Mapper, consult your documentation or contact the third party vendor.
