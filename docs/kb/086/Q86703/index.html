SUMMARY
=======

The NEC PCP (Printer Control Panel Automatic Emulation Switching) version 2.2
software that ships with all NEC Silentwriter printers may cause problems when
it is used with Microsoft Windows version 3.1. Reported problems include
incorrect emulation switching and general protection (GP) faults.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: The following information was taken from the NEC bulletin board service
(BBS).

A revision of the Printer Control Panel Automatic Emulation Switching software
(shipped with all Silentwriter Page Printers) is now available to correct
problems encountered while running this package with Microsoft Windows 3.1.

The revised product, version 2.3, will begin shipping with all Silentwriters in
the near future. Current owners may receive a new copy of PCP by calling
1-800-995-6487 from 8A to 8P Eastern Daylight time Monday through Friday.
Silentwriter owners who purchased their printer after January 1, 1992 will
receive this upgrade free of charge. Silentwriter owners who purchased their
printers before January 1, 1992 will be charged a $15.00 handling and shipping
fee. The software upgrade center will accept popular credit cards or a check by
mail. Mailing address is:

  NEC Redemption Center
  P.O. Box 3503,
  Wallingford, CT 06494

The upgrade package includes installation instructions, and also revised .WPD
files for Silentwriter Model 95 usage with Windows 3.1. This 800 number is for
