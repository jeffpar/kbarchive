SUMMARY
=======

The information in this article applies to Microsoft LAN Manager

version 2.1 running under MS OS/2 version 1.31.
-----------------------------------------------

This article discusses an often overlooked feature of RAS (remote access server),
which is "network independence." If you use RAS, even though you may have one
only network stack (AsyBEUI), you can log on to any server on any network the
remote access server is using (any network the client dialed into). That is, a
RAS client can log on to and use a TCP/IP server, a UBXNS server, or even a
UBLOOP server, provided that the RAS server dialed into uses these protocols.

Normally, on the "real" network, you cannot communicate with another server
unless the server and the client share the same protocol. RAS "breaks" this
protocol barrier. This also means that the RAS clients have more free memory
because they do NOT require that dual or triple stacks be loaded. Eventually,
AsyBEUI may become even smaller.

Also, Windows 3.0/3.1 enhanced mode offers multiple MS-DOS boxes, 32-bit
execution, more than 1 megabyte (MB) of memory, and virtual memory). Just start
Windows 3.1 and use RAS.


The File Manager displays network drives, and you have several remote printers.
You can drag and drop a document you were working on at work onto your local
hard disk and finish that document from home. You can then drag and drop your
local document onto the printer icon to print your document at work remotely.
