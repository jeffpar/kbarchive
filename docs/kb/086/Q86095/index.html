SUMMARY
=======

This article lists and explains all the entries in the Microsoft Mail for
Windows private profile, MSMAIL.INI, that are contained in the [Custom Commands]
section.

[Custom Commands]

This section may contain any number of entries of complicated form. Each entry
specifies a custom command that is installed into one of the Mail menus at run
time. This section may appear both in the usual location, the MSMAIL.INI in your
Windows directory, and in SHARED.INI in the directory pointer to by the
SharedExtensionsDir entry of MSMAIL.INI. Here are a synopsis and a couple of
examples of the [Custom Commands] entry format; a description of each subfield
follows. Each entry must occupy a single line. Many sub fields are optional.

tag=version;menu;name;position;DLL name;command;event map;status text;help
file;help context;

IC3=3.2;File;&amp;Empty Wastebasket;13;EMPTYWB.DLL;1;;Purge messages from the
wastebasket

IC4=3.2;Help;&amp;Out of Office;10;OOF.DLL;3;;Out of Office Email Notification

  tag            Identifies the command to someone reading the INI
                 file, but serves no other purpose.

  version        Identifies the version of Mail with which the
                 command is compatible; 3.2 is the current version.

  menu           Names the menu to which the custom command should be
                 added, such as File or Help.

  name           The command name that is to appear on the menu. As
                 usual, you may include an ampersand (&amp;) just before
                 the letter that is to serve as an ALT-key
                 accelerator.

  position       The zero-relative position within its menu at which
                 the command should appear. -1 places the command at
                 the end of the menu.

  DLL name       Name or path of the DLL in which the custom command
                 resides.

  command        Command string passed as one of the parameters to
                 the DLL entry point for the command.

  event map      Sequence of up to 16 digits. Each can be 0 or 1,
                 indicating that the DLL should be called for a
                 specific event. Currently 3 events are defined; the
                 rest are reserved and must be zero:

                 The first digit means Mail start-up.
                 The second digit means Mail exit.
                 The third digit means the arrival of a new message.

  status text    Text to be displayed in the Mail status bar when the
                 user cursors to the command in the menu.

  help file      Windows Help file to be invoked when the user
                 presses F1 while the command is selected. Passed to
                 the Windows Help program.

  help context   Passed to the Windows Help program along with the
                 Help file name. Use -1 (Help file index) if there is
                 no specific entry in the Help file for this command.

A more detailed description of custom command creation and installation can be
found in the Microsoft Mail "Technical Reference."
