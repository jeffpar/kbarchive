SUMMARY
=======

This article lists and explains all the entries in the Microsoft Mail for
Windows private profile, MSMAIL.INI, that are contained in the [MMF] section.

MORE INFORMATION
================

[MMF]
-----

Most entries in this section affect automatic compression of the Mail message
file. By default, message files have the extension .MMF. When enabled, automatic
compression uses idle time on your computer to recover disk space freed by
deleting messages and return that space to the file system.

AutoDisconnectInterval=&lt;number of minutes&gt;:

This entry sets the amount of system idle time before a Mail file not stored
locally is closed. Any system activity reopens a closed Mail file automatically.
Closing Mail files that are stored on the Mail server ensures that they can be
backed up when your system administrator backs up the Mail server. If your Mail
file is stored locally, you should back it up using the Mail Backup command. If
this entry is set to 0 (zero), your Mail file is closed only when you exit and
sign out of Mail. This setting should be larger than the Secs_Till_Fast_Compress
setting to give Mail time to compress the Mail file before it is closed.

The default value is 60 minutes of system inactivity.

CelemMax=&lt;number&gt;:

This entry specifies the maximum number of messages Mail will allow to be placed
in a folder. It is for debugging purposes only.

The default value is 5400, which is the maximum in all cases.

Kb_Free_Start_Compress=&lt;number of kilobytes&gt;:

The message store manager's background compression algorithm will kick in when it
detects at least this much recoverable space in your message file. Both this
entry and Percent_Free_Start_Compress are always active; the first one to
trigger starts compression.

The default value is 300K.

Kb_Free_Stop_Compress=&lt;number of kilobytes&gt;:

The message store manager's background compression algorithm will shut off when
there is less than this much recoverable space in your message file. This avoids
extensive compression trying to recover the last little bit of free space. Both
this entry and Percent_Free_Stop_Compress are always active; the last one to
trigger stops compression.

The default value is 100K.

No_Compress=&lt;0/1&gt;:

Set this entry to 1 to entirely disable background compression of the message
store.

The default value is 0 (background compression is enabled).

Percent_Free_Start_Compress=&lt;number&gt;:

Background compression will start when the amount of recoverable space rises
above this percentage of the total file size. Both this entry and
Kb_Free_Start_Compress are always active; the first one to trigger starts
compression.

The default value is 10 (ten percent).

Percent_Free_Stop_Compress=&lt;number&gt;:

Background compression will stop when the amount of recoverable space falls below
this percentage of the total .MMF file size. Both this entry and
Kb_Free_Stop_Compress are always active; the last one to trigger stops
compression.

The default value is 5 (5 percent).

Secs_Till_Fast_Compress=&lt;number of seconds&gt;:

The background compression algorithm has a "fast mode" and a "slow mode." It
begins in slow mode, trying to avoid impacting system response time. After a
number of seconds of system inactivity, defined by this entry, it will switch to
fast mode. Any user activity will switch it back into slow mode.

The default value is 600 seconds (ten minutes) of system inactivity.
