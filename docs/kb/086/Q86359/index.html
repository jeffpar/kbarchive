1.0  Running Windows with an Operating System Other Than MS-DOS
---------------------------------------------------------------

Microsoft Windows and MS-DOS work together as an integrated system.
They were designed together and extensively tested together on a wide
variety of computers and hardware configurations. Running Windows
version 3.1 on an operating system other than MS-DOS could cause
unexpected results or poor performance.

2.0  Preventing Stack Overflow
------------------------------

Stacks are temporary data structures that MS-DOS and applications use
for processing hardware events. If, while setting up Windows, Setup
detects hardware or software that require a certain stack size, Setup
will place the following command line in your CONFIG.SYS file:

stacks=9,256

This should be sufficient most of the time. However, if you receive
the Internal Stack Overflow message when running Windows in 386
enhanced mode, or if your system fails for no apparent reason when
running Windows in standard mode (especially if you are setting up or
moving the mouse), first try increasing the second number on the
stacks= command line (for example, 256)  If that doesn't work, try
increasing the first number (for example, 9). For more information
about the stacks setting and modifying the CONFIG.SYS file, see your
MS-DOS documentation.

3.0  Using 32-Bit Disk Access
-----------------------------

By default, 32-bit disk access is turned off to prevent disk errors on
some battery-powered portable computers. However, 32-bit disk access
may run correctly with some battery-powered portable computers, such
as the Zenith MasterSport SL. If you want to try using 32-bit disk
access, select the 32-bit disk access check box in the Virtual Memory
dialog box (choose the 386 Enhanced option in Control Panel). For more
information, see Chapter 14, "Optimizing Windows," in the Microsoft
Windows User's Guide.

Caution: Before using 32-bit disk access on a battery-powered portable
computer, it is highly recommended that you back up your hard disk.
Because 32-bit Disk Access has not been fully tested on all battery-
powered systems, you may receive disk errors while using it.

4.0  Using Memory Managers
--------------------------

This section describes problems you may encounter using memory
managers with Windows
version 3.1.

4.1  Solving Memory Conflicts by Using MONOUMB.386 or MONOUMB2.386
------------------------------------------------------------------

If you encounter the following message when starting Windows in 386
enhanced mode, your display driver may be accessing the monochrome
address range (B000-B7FF), which prevents the memory manager from
using this range for upper memory blocks:

"Windows cannot set up an upper memory block at segment B000. Exclude
this address space by using the syntax of your memory manager. For
more information, see the README.WRI file. Type WIN /S to start
Windows in standard mode and choose the Read Me icon,"

To solve this problem, try installing MONOUMB2.386 on your system.
MONOUMB2.386 is a device driver provided with Windows that allows
certain memory managers to use the monochrome address range for upper
memory blocks, even if your display driver is accessing this range.

To install MONOUMB2.386:

1.  Copy and expand the MONOUMB2.38_ file that is on your Windows disk
to your Windows SYSTEM directory by typing the following at the MS-DOS
prompt:

  expand a:monoumb2.38_ c:\windows\system\monoumb2.386

2.  Add the following setting to the [386Enh] section in the
SYSTEM.INI file:

  device=monoumb2.386

3.  Start Windows.

Note: MONOUMB2.386 may not work with some memory managers, such as
EMM386.EXE. In this case, you can try using MONOUMB.386, provided with
the Windows Driver Library. To obtain a copy of the Windows Driver
Library, contact Microsoft.

You can also exclude the address region B000-B7FF, which specifies
that the memory manager should not try to use this address range for
upper memory blocks.  For information about excluding specific address
ranges, see the following topic.

4.2  Solving Memory Conflicts by Excluding an Address Range
-----------------------------------------------------------

If you encounter the following message when starting Windows in 386
enhanced mode, and the address specified is not B000, you must exclude
the address range.

"Windows cannot set up an upper memory block at segment xxxx. Exclude
this address space by using the syntax of your memory manager. For
more information, see the README.WRI file. Type WIN /S to start
Windows in standard mode and choose the Read Me icon."

If the address specified is B000, you can try using MONOUMB2.386 or
MONOUMB.386, as described in the preceding topic.

The method you use to exclude an address range depends on the memory
manager you are using. For example, if you are using EMM386.EXE, you
need to remove the I=xxxxx option from the device=emm386.exe command
line in your CONFIG.SYS file, where xxxxx is the address range
starting at the address specified in the error message.

If you are using QEMM, you need to include the X= option on the
device=qemm386.sys command line in your CONFIG.SYS file. For example,
to exclude the address range C000-C7FF, you would specify the
following:

  device=qemm386.sys X=C000-C7FF

For more information about modifying your CONFIG.SYS file, see your
MS-DOS documentation. For more information about installing and
configuring EMM386.EXE, see Chapter 14, "Optimizing Windows," in the
Microsoft Windows User's Guide. For information about installing and
configuring other memory managers, see the documentation provided with
your memory manager.

4.3  Using 386MAX
-----------------

If you are running 386MAX with Windows version 3.1, note the
following:

- Do not use options that limit the EMS swap region in the upper
 memory area. If you include exclude= options on the 386max or
 bluemax command line or in the .PRO file (usually called
 386MAX.PRO), make sure that the address range specified does not
 extend beyond A000.

 For example, exclude=1800-A000 is acceptable, but exclude=1800-B800
 is not. If the address range specified by using the exclude= option
 extends beyond A000, Windows may not run properly in 386 enhanced
 mode. If you must exclude an address range above A000, use the RAM=
 option instead. For more information about this and other options,
 see your 386MAX documentation.

- Do not load SMARTDrive when QCache is running.

 Note: The 386MAX setup program does not detect SMARTDrive version
 4.0 and may recommend that you install QCache.

- If you update an earlier version of 386MAX to version 6.0, the
 386MAX version 6.0 setup program may not remove the LOAD=WINDOWS.LOD
 line from your .PRO file. You can remove this line manually. It is
 not needed and removing it will free up a small amount of memory.

5.0  Using Advanced Power Management (APM)
------------------------------------------

Windows version 3.1 includes support for Advanced Power Management
(APM). This enables Windows to extend battery life, display power-
status information, and work together with the suspend features of
battery-powered personal computers. To find out if your computer
supports APM, contact your computer manufacturer.

If your computer supports APM, do the following to install it on your
system:

1. Quit Windows.

2. Run Windows Setup and select one of the following system types:

  MS-DOS System with APM
  Intel 386SL Based System with APM

Select "Intel 386SL Based System with APM" if your computer has an
Intel 386SL processor and supports the SL Enhanced Options for APM.
Otherwise, select "MS-DOS System with APM."

3.  Restart Windows.

    A Power icon appears in the Control Panel window.

4.  Choose the Power icon to configure power-management settings.

For more information about the settings, press F1 or choose the Help
button while using the Power Management dialog box.

6.0  Using SMARTDrive Version 4.0
---------------------------------
This section describes some solutions to problems that you might
encounter when using SMARTDrive version 4.0 (provided with Windows
version 3.1) together with specific applications or hardware.

6.1  Accessing Floppy Disk Drives on Older COMPAQ DESKPROS
----------------------------------------------------------

On some COMPAQ DESKPRO 386/16 and 386/20 computers, you might
experience problems accessing floppy disks when SMARTDrive version 4.0
is installed. To work around the problem, you can try one of the
following solutions:

- Place the SMARTDrive buffer into low memory by adding the following
 option to the smartdrv command line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

  smartdrv /L

- Disable the caching on floppy disk drives by adding the following
 options to the smartdrv command line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

  smartdrv A- B-

For more information about these options, see Chapter 14, "Optimizing
Windows," in the Microsoft Windows User's Guide.

6.2  Using SMARTDrive with Double Buffering
-------------------------------------------

Most expanded-memory emulators attempt to optimize SMARTDrive by
configuring it to load into upper memory blocks (UMBs). This will
cause problems if you are running Windows in 386 enhanced mode with
double buffering. If you need to use double buffering with SMARTDrive,
make sure that SMARTDrive is configured in the CONFIG.SYS file to load
into low memory. The command line should look like this:

  device=smartdrv.exe /double_buffer

This problem applies only to the smartdrv command line in the
CONFIG.SYS file. It does not apply to the references to SMARTDrive in
the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. For more information about using double
buffering with SMARTDrive, see Chapter 14, "Optimizing Windows," in
the Microsoft Windows User's Guide.

6.3  Using SMARTDrive with Norton Utilities Version 6.0 Disk Monitor
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Do not use the Disk Protect feature in Norton Utilities Version 6.0
Disk Monitor with
SMARTDrive version 4.0. If you try to write to the protected drive,
you will encounter an error
and your system will fail. If you want to write to and cache a
protected drive, add the drive letter to
the smartdrv command line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. For example, if
drive D is a protected
drive, you would add the following:

       smartdrv d

Or you can use the Norton cache program instead when using Disk
Monitor.

6.4  Using SMARTDrive with SuperStor Disk-Compression Utility
-------------------------------------------------------------

- Do not use the Create Mountable Drive, Mount, and Dismount features
 of SuperStor after SMARTDrive is loaded. You must configure your
 SuperStor partitions before loading SMARTDrive. Windows Setup places
 the smartdrv command line first in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. If your
 AUTOEXEC.BAT file includes "mount" configuration commands, make sure
 that the smartdrv command line follows the SuperStor configuration
 command lines.

- Also, you will receive read-write errors if you use SMARTDrive to
 cache a SuperStor compressed drive. To prevent SMARTDrive from
 caching the compressed drive, you must include the drive letter-
 option on the smartdrv command line.

 For example, if drive C is the uncompressed drive, and drives E and
 F are the compressed SuperStor drives, you would include the
 following command line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

    smartdrv e- f-

6.5  Using SMARTDrive with Copy-Protected Games and Applications
----------------------------------------------------------------

When using SMARTDrive, you may encounter problems starting a copy-
protected application that requires you to place the master disk in
the floppy disk drive. To solve this problem, you need to disable
caching on the floppy disk drive by using the drive letter - option
when you load SMARTDrive. For example, if you load SMARTDrive from
your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and are using drive A, you need to include the
following command line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

  smartdrv a-

7.0  Using Multimedia Extensions Version 1.0 with Windows Version 3.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------

This section covers information that is specific to using the
Multimedia Extensions version 1.0 with Windows version 3.1. It also
covers additional tasks you need to perform to configure your system
properly for use with the multimedia extensions.

7.1  Upgrading to Windows Version 3.1
-------------------------------------

To use the multimedia extensions with Windows version 3.1, first set
up Windows with Multimedia version 1.0, and then upgrade to Windows
version 3.1 by installing it into the same directory. If you set up
Windows version 3.1 before setting up Windows with Multimedia, not all
the files will be properly installed.

7.2  Configuring MIDI Setups
----------------------------
When you set up Windows version 3.1, Setup copies the multimedia
extensions MIDI-setup file MIDIMAP.CFG to MIDIMAP.OLD, and then
replaces it with an updated version. This version contains several new
MIDI setups that support playing MIDI information authored according
to General MIDI guidelines. If you want to use a setup in the new
MIDIMAP.CFG file and are using sound drivers that are not provided by
Windows, you will need to change the port settings to match the ports
used by your sound device. To do this, use the MIDI Mapper option in
Control Panel.

You can also use the original MIDIMAP.CFG file (renamed by Setup to
MIDIMAP.OLD). You might want to do this if the original file contains
custom MIDI setups that you created yourself or that were provided by
your sound-device manufacturer. To use the original file, rename
MIDIMAP.CFG to MIDIMAP.WIN, and then rename MIDIMAP.OLD to
MIDIMAP.CFG. If the port settings in your original setups refer to the
Ad Lib or Sound Blaster ports and you are using different drivers,
then you will need to change the port settings to match the output
ports used by your sound device.

For more information about using MIDI Mapper to modify MIDI setups,
see Chapter 5, "Control Panel," in the Microsoft Windows User's Guide.

7.3  Configuring Your Display
-----------------------------

The multimedia extensions Display icon in Control Panel is not
available when you upgrade from Windows with Multimedia version 1.0 to
Windows version 3.1. If you need to change options for your display,
use the Windows Setup application in the Main group in Program Manager
to make these changes.

7.4  Sample MIDI File
---------------------

The sample MIDI file CANYON.MID included with Windows version 3.1 that
you can play with Windows Media Player is provided by Passport
Designs, Inc.

7.5  Using HyperGuide
---------------------

The information in HyperGuide refers to Windows version 3.0, not
Windows version 3.1. If you need to use Windows documentation, see the
Microsoft Windows User's Guide that comes with Windows version 3.1.

7.6  Using Music Box
--------------------

Music Box is not fully compatible with Windows version 3.1. Although
your compact discs will play correctly, you will encounter problems
using the Save Info button in the Program dialog box to save disc-
title and track-title information. If you want to modify this
information, you must do so manually by editing the MUSICBOX.INI file.
To add a new disc to the file, you can determine the disc ID number by
viewing the information in the About dialog box.

7.7  Using Alarm Clock
----------------------

The Alarm Clock in the Multimedia Extensions version 1.0 is not fully
compatible with Windows version 3.1. If you are using the digital
display, the time may appear slanted or a system error may occur,
depending on the size of the Alarm Clock window.

8.0  Running Specific Non-Windows Applications
----------------------------------------------

This section provides general information about running applications
in Windows version 3.1. It also describes problems you might encounter
while running specific non-Windows applications with Windows version
3.1.

8.1  Communications Applications
--------------------------------

For best results when running a non-Windows communications application
in the background, run it as an icon instead of in a window. Also,
create a PIF (program information file) for the non-Windows
communications application (if one does not already exist) and do the
following:

- Select the Execute: Background check box.

- If you encounter errors during file transfers while running the
 application in the background, increase the Background Priority
 option in the Advanced Options dialog box.

- If you use a permanent swap file with 32-bit disk access, select the
 Lock Application Memory check box in the Advanced Options dialog
 box.

For information about using and creating PIFs, see Chapter 8, "PIF
Editor," in the Microsoft Windows User's Guide.

8.2  Creative Labs JukeBox
--------------------------

If you are using a Sound Blaster sound card, do not set up or use the
JukeBox application included in your Sound Blaster package with
Windows version 3.1.  JukeBox interferes with the Windows version 3.1
driver for the Ad Lib synthesizer and causes errors when you try to
install the drivers for the Sound Blaster card.

8.3  Game or Timing-Sensitive Applications
------------------------------------------

Some game applications or applications that rely on the computer's
timer may perform poorly in Windows version 3.1. You can try
increasing the performance by turning off the TrapTimerPorts setting
in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file, as follows:

  TrapTimerPorts=Off

Note: The TrapTimerPorts setting is on by default. Turning it off may
cause errors or a loss of data when transferring files by using a
communications application. It is recommended that you leave this
setting turned on when using a communications application.

8.4  Third-Party Expanded-Memory Emulators with MS-DOS Version 5.0
------------------------------------------------------------------

Many expanded-memory emulators will cause problems if you use them to
provide upper memory blocks (UMBs) for the MS-DOS version 5.0 loadhigh
and devicehigh commands. If you want to use these MS-DOS commands to
load drivers or applications high, then use the Windows EMM386.EXE
expanded-memory emulator to provide UMBs instead. If you must use a
third-party expanded-memory emulator, then use the load high feature
provided with the emulator, instead of the MS-DOS commands.

8.5  PC Tools Applications
--------------------------

If you run a PC Tools non-Windows application in a window, or if you
switch to it while Windows is running in standard mode, the display
might be garbled, because PC Tools applications use a graphics font
that is not displayed correctly (this problem does not occur if you
run the application in a full screen when Windows is running in 386
enhanced mode).

To correct the problem, start your PC Tools non-Windows applications
by using the /NF option. If your PC Tools non-Windows applications are
included in a Program Manager group, use the Properties command to add
the /NF option to the command line for the application. For more
information about changing application properties, see Chapter 3,
"Program Manager," in the Microsoft Windows User's Guide.

You can also include the /NF option in the application's program
information file (PIF) by typing it in the Optional Parameters text
box in PIF Editor, or you can use the PC Tools PC Config program to
specify that PC Tools applications should use the Text Font to display
information. For more information about changing an application's PIF,
see Chapter 8, "PIF Editor," in the Microsoft Windows User's Guide.

8.6  WordPerfect Version 5.1

When running WordPerfect version 5.1 in a window, the Windows mouse
pointer and the WordPerfect mouse pointer will not appear in the same
place. To fix this problem, do the following:

1.  In WordPerfect, press SHIFT+F1.

2.  Select M for Mouse and A for Acceleration Factor.

3.  Set the Acceleration Factor to 1.

4.  Press ENTER three times to return to your document.

5.  Enlarge the WordPerfect window to fill the entire screen.

6.  Move the Windows mouse pointer into the WordPerfect window, and
   then move it to the far-right edge of the window.

7.  Move the mouse pointer to the far-left edge of the window.

8.  Move the pointer back to the center of the window, and then move
   it down to the bottom edge.

9.  Finally, move the pointer up to the upper-left corner of the
   window.

8.7   3270-Emulation Applications
---------------------------------

You may encounter problems using certain 3270-emulation applications
with Windows version 3.1. If you are using one of these applications,
it is recommended that you purchase the Windows Resource Kit for the
Microsoft Windows Operating System Version 3.1. This kit provides
troubleshooting information about using 3270-emulation applications,
in addition to complete technical information about Windows version
3.1 for the support professional. It includes a technical reference
manual and a disk containing helpful utilities, system resource
viewers, drivers, and accessories. To order the Windows Resource Kit
within the United States, dial:

  1-800-642-7676

To order outside of the United States, dial the phone number for your
area. You can find this number on the International Subsidiary card.

8.8    AutoCad
--------------

When running AutoCad 386 under Windows 3.1, note the following:

- AutoCad 386 runs in standard mode only if no LIMulator is installed.
 To run in 386 enhanced mode, you must upgrade to AutoCad for
 Windows.

- The PIF setting for AutoCad 386 are set for a minimum configuration.
 Using these setting results in poor performance. To improve
 performance, you can modify the PIF settings, as described below.

 PIF Settings
 ------------

 To improve the performance of AutoCad 386, make the following
 changes to the standard mode PIF:

   XMS MEMORY REQUIRED should be set to 1. This forces XMS memory to
   be provided to an application. Unless a required amount is listed,
   no XMS memory is provided.

   XMS MEMORY DESIRED should be set from 1024 to 4096. 1024
   significantly improves performance. The manufacturer recommends
   4096 for best performance.

   OTHER REQUIREMENTS: For these settings to work, you must have
   adequate XMS memory available. If there is not enough, no adverse
   effects are apparent, but performance is only improved by the real
   amount of XMS provided. You must also have an equivalent amount of
   disk space free for a swap file.
