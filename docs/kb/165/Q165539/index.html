6. Q. Can I create maps for Pocket Streets from the maps in Microsoft Automap
  Streets Plus 97?

  A. You can use Streets 98 to create a Pocket Streets map of any area in the
  United States. However, the 1997 Edition of Microsoft Automap Streets Plus
  does not have the ability to export maps to Pocket Streets.

7. Q. Why are some details that are available in Streets Plus not available in
  Pocket Streets?

  A. To keep the maps small enough for the memory available on the H/PC, some
  information is not included in maps for Pocket Streets. Street addresses and
  Points of Interest are still available.

8. Q. Can I create or import pushpins for addresses and custom places in Pocket
  Streets?

  A. Pocket Streets, version 2.0 supports pushpins. When you export a map from
  Streets 98, the program creates a map file and a separate pushpins file that
  contains all open pushpins on the map. To use your pushpins with Pocket
  Streets, copy both the map file and the pushpins file to your H/PC device.

10. Q. How can I select and view Points of Interest?

  A. On the Options menu, tap Points of Interest. Click the items that you want
  to display. To prevent map clutter, Points of Interest are only shown at
  close zoom levels. To view the selected Points of Interest use the zoom
  control to select the desired area.

11. Q. The maps are difficult to read because of the dark background. How can I
  change this?

  A. You can select a different background color from Map Styles on the Options
  menu.
