IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect a Remote Access Service (RAS) client to a Windows NT
RAS Server computer, the connection attempt fails and you may receive any of the
following error messages:

  Checking network protocol connections
  TCP/IP cp reported error 2.
  The system cannot find the file specified

or

  Event ID 4106
  The Dial-up connection 'SpryNet or whom ever using' could not be made.
  The error reported was: [2]
  The system could not find the file specified.

CAUSE
=====

An incorrect registry entry refers to another registry entry that does not
exist.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

On the RAS client, there are numbered entries for each installed network adapter
under the following registry key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT
\CurrentVersion\NetworkCards

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

Under normal circumstances, each entry will have a ServiceName value that refers
to a registry key under the following key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Check each NetworkCards entry and confirm that there is a corresponding
  Services entry. If a NetworkCards entry refers to a service that does not
  have a corresponding Services key, delete the entire numbered key (Do not
  delete any other NetworkCards entries, and do not delete the entire
  NetworkCards key).

3. Quit Registry Editor and retry the RAS connection.
