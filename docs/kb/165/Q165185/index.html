-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, version 4.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 4.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a modeless address book is opened by other MAPI applications, and the
Microsoft Exchange Client tries to open and close the address book, it stops
responding. Because the DBCS version of Microsoft Exchange Server uses a
modeless address book, DBCS Microsoft Exchange Client stops responding with
modeless address book MAPI applications.

CAUSE
=====

This problem happens when RichEdit controls are used instead of normal edit
controls for the edit control in the modeless Address Book. This used to be the
case in the Far East version only. The failure happens because WMSUI is released
before the address book dialog box is closed. When the RichEdit control on the
dialog box is going to be removed, it fails because the control no longer
exists.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft Exchange clients,
version 4.0, listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was corrected
in Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 U.S. Service Pack 4. For information on
obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft
