The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 SP2 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Service Pack 2 for Windows NT 4.0 over the network and restart
your computer, you may receive error messages stating that some files (for
example Ntfs.sys or Advapi32.dll) are corrupt.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the Service Pack 2 binary files were packaged using
authentication for web distribution. You only experience this problem when you
expand a previous version of Service Pack 2 and then copy the files from one
computer with an NTFS partition to another computer over the network (and only
when the two systems negotiate raw write mode between them.)

The specific files affected by this problem are:

  Ntfs.sys
  Advapi32.dll
  Winhlp32.exe
  Halapic.dll

This does not occur with the CD-ROM version of Service Pack 2.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Service Pack 2 binary files were repackaged to resolve this problem. Please
download the Service Pack 2 files again.

IMPORTANT: The files did not change, they were only repackaged without
authentication.

NOTE: If your system no longer starts due to Ntoskrnl.exe or other critical
system files being corrupt, you must replace these files manually. This may
require you to install another copy of Windows NT in different folder so that
you can access the original installation, especially on an NTFS partition.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you experience this problem with the latest version of Service Pack, perform
one of the following steps:

- Copy the Service Pack locally and run Update.exe from your local hard disk.

  -or-

- Manually update the Rdr.sys file before you apply Service Pack 2 over the
  network. To do this, rename Rdr.sys in the %systemroot%\System32\Drivers
  folder, copy the expanded version of Rdr.sys from Service Pack 2 to this
  location, restart your computer, and then run Update.exe.
