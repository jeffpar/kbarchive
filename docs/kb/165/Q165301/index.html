SYMPTOMS
========

If you manually type a numbering scheme followed by text so that the "Automatic
numbered lists" feature is invoked, the number you type automatically changes by
one if numbering previous to this item was within plus or minus one to the item
you just typed.

NOTE: To enable the "Automatic numbered lists" feature, click AutoCorrect on the
Tools menu, click the "AutoFormat As You Type" tab, and click to select the
"Automatic numbered lists" check box.

CAUSE
=====

This functionality is by design. After you type a number, AutoCorrect looks
backward through the document for the closest numbered list. If it finds a
numbered list where the last item in the list is numbered plus or minus one,
from the number you just typed, Word will change the number you just typed so
that it becomes the next item in the list.

This allows you to add an item to an existing list by guessing close to the
correct number without needing to know the exact next number in the sequence.

WORKAROUND
==========

To prevent the number from attaching to the previous list, press CTRL+Z on the
keyboard to undo the automatic formatting.

To adjust the numbering so that it creates a new numbering scheme, follow these
steps:

1. Position the insertion point on the line you want to number.

2. On the Format menu, click Bullets And Numbering.

3. Click the Numbered tab, and then click the numbering scheme you want.

4. Click Customize.

5. In the Start At box, adjust the starting number, and then make any other
  changes you want.

6. Click OK.

You now have a second numbered list that is not connected to the first numbered
list.
