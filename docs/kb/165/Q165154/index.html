-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A 3270 print session defined for the SNA Server 3.0 Host Print Service may stay
in a spooling state after a host print job is sent to the printer. The result of
this is that the print job does not finish printing completely.

CAUSE
=====

The credit mechanism used by the FMI interface to provide flow control between
SNA Server and an application (to prevent the application from exhausting its
resources) does not correctly handle a BID message. A BID message received from
the host is counted for pacing purposes, but not for credit purposes. The
default credit algorithm fails to send a credit message from the Print Server
service to the SNA Server service. Because the SNA Server service did not
receive a credit message, it cannot send a pacing response to the host. This
causes the host to stop sending data to SNA Server for the print session,
causing the print session to remain in a spooling state. Therefore, the print
job does not finish printing.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, obtain the hotfix mentioned below. With the hotfix,
the 3270 Print Provider has been updated to correct this problem. This update
allows a single credit message to be sent to the SNA Server service for all data
messages it receives. The updated module is:

  &lt;Snaroot&gt;\System\3270ppd.dll

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
