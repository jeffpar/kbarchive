The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SUMMARY
=======

This article demonstrates how to create registry entries for a user profile for
your application that includes a Help file, and Clipboard and Report formats.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you use the Setup Wizard to add registry entries to your custom Setup
program that will create user profiles for your custom application, you must
click to select the Profile check box on the Database Shortcut Properties tab on
the Add Shortcuts screen, and you must create registry entries for your user
profiles on the screen marked "Add the registry values that you want your custom
Setup program to create and then set properties for each."

There are three steps involved in creating a custom application that includes a
user profile. They are as follows:

1. Adding the necessary files to the List Of Files box.

2. Creating a shortcut that includes the /Profile switch.

3. Creating the registry entries that will be copied to the Windows registry on
  the computer on which you are installing the application.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And Values
online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should make a
backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you edit the
registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

1. To add files to the List Of Files box, start the Setup Wizard program and in
  the List Of Files box, add the files that you are including in your custom
  application. This should include any .hlp and .cnt files that you may be
  adding for your Help file. For example, if you were adding a content page, a
  Help file and a database file to the List Of Files box, your screen would
  look similar to this:

     List of Files:

     C:\My Documents\Northwind.mdb
     C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Samples\Nwind80.hlp
     C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Samples\Nwind80.cnt

2. To create a shortcut that includes the /Profile switch, follow these steps:

   a. On the Add The Shortcuts screen, click the Database Shortcut
      Properties tab, click Add, and type a description for your shortcut
      in the Description box.

   b. Under the Database Command-Line Options, click to select the Profile
      and Run-time check boxes, and then click Next.

   c. Click Yes and then OK to the Setup Wizard messages.

      NOTE: The shortcut that is created will open your custom application
      as a run-time application with a profile. You may also want to add a
      shortcut that will open your Help file.

3. To add the registry entries for your custom application, follow these steps:

   a. In the "List of Registry Values" box, click Add and complete the
      following information for each entry that needs to be added to the
      registry:

      Top-Level for Key: $(Machine's Software Key for App)
      Path to Key: Clipboard Formats
      Value Name: Microsoft Excel (*.xls)
      Base Value Data on File: (none)
      Value Data: soa800.dll,8,xls,Biff5,MicrosoftExcel(*.xls),0
      Value Data Type: String
      Component Name: Application

      NOTE: The "Top-Level for Key" entry has the same effect as manually
      navigating to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\YourCompanyName\ 
      YourApplicationName\YourVersionNumber key.

      NOTE: The Path To Key has the same effect as manually adding a new
      key under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\YourCompanyName\ 
      YourApplicationName\YourVersionNumber key.

      Top-Level for Key: $(Machine's Software Key for App)
      Path to Key: Clipboard Formats
      Value Name: MS-DOS Text (*.txt)
      Base Value Data on File: (none)
      Value Data: soa800.dll,10,txt,7,MS-DOSText(*.txt),0

      Base Value Data on File: (none)
      Value Data: soa800.dll,9,rtf,Rich Text
      Format,RichTextFormat(*.rtf),0
      Value Data Type: String
      Component Name: Application

      Top-Level for Key: $(Machine's Software Key for App)
      Path to Key: Report Formats
      Value Name: HTML Documents
      Base Value Data on File: (none)
      Value Data: html,SOA_RptToHtml,1,HTML (*.html),1
      Value Data Type: String
      Component Name: Application

      Top-Level for Key: $(Machine's Software Key for App)
      Path to Key: Report Formats
      Value Name: Microsoft Excel
      Base Value Data on File: (none)
      Value Data: xls,SOA_RptToBIFF, Biff5,Microsoft Excel (*.xls),0
      Value Data Type: String
      Component Name: Application

      Top-Level for Key: $(Machine's Software Key for App)
      Path to Key: Report Formats
      Value Name: MS-DOS Text
      Base Value Data on File: (none)
      Value Data: txt,SOA_RptToAscii,1,MS-DOS Text (*.txt),0
      Value Data Type: String
      Component Name: Application

      Top-Level for Key: $(Machine's Software Key for App)
      Path to Key: Report Formats
      Value Name: Rich Text Format
      Base Value Data on File: (none)
      Value Data: rtf,SOA_RptToRTF,Rich Text Format,Rich Text Format
      (*.rtf),0
      Value Data Type: String
      Component Name: Application

      Top-Level for Key: $(Machine's Software Key for App)
      Path to Key: Run-Time Options
      Value Name: AppHelpFile
      Base Value Data on File: Nwind80.hlp
      Value Data Type: String
      Value Data:
      Component Name: Application

      NOTE: Use the "Base Value Data on File" box if the value of the key
      or entry that you are adding is a file name that you are adding to
      the Setup Wizard program, as in the case of a Custom Help file.
      The Value Data box will automatically be populated with the
      path to your Help file when you supply the Base Value Data on File
      value.

   b. When you are finish adding all of the entries, click Next.

4. Continue through the Setup Wizard, answering the questions to design your
  custom setup program the way you want it.

5. Run your custom Setup program on a computer that does not have Microsoft
  Access.

6. Start the Registry Editor and navigate to the following keys:

   a. \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Access Runtime\Profiles

      You should see an entry similar to the following:
