-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, version 3.0 
- Microsoft SNA Workstation, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If the installation path specified for SNA Server 3.0 contains more than eight
characters, the following error message is displayed:

  Illegal Directory Specified

  Illegal directory name - restart setup and choose the target directory name
  for SNA Server to be max 8 characters, with no spaces between.

The same error message occurs if the installation path contains a directory name
that is greater than eight characters in length.

These problems also occur with SNA Workstation 3.0 and the Windows NT SNA Server
3.0 Client.

CAUSE
=====

The setup programs for SNA Server, SNA Workstation 3.0, and the Windows NT 3.0
client do not support paths or directory names greater than eight characters in
length.

RESOLUTION
==========

The setup program has been updated to support paths and directory names that are
longer than eight characters. The following restrictions still apply even after
applying this fix:

- The installation path must be 40 characters or less in length.

- The installation path must not include any spaces. The following example is
  not a valid path:

  C:\Program Files\SNA


The updated files are:

  SNA Server: &lt;Snaroot&gt;\Setup\Server\Snasetup.dll
  Windows NT Client: &lt;Snaroot&gt;\Setup\Ntclient\Snasetup.dll

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server version 3.0. This
problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft SNA Server 3.0 U.S. Service Pack.
For information on obtaining the service pack, query on the following word in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
