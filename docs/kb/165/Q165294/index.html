To change your member information, follow these steps:

1. Start Microsoft Exchange while connected to MSN, The Microsoft Network.

2. On the Tools menu, click Address Book.

3. In the Show Names From The box, click Microsoft Network.

4. On the Tools menu, click Find.

5. In the Member ID box, type your Member ID.

6. Click OK.

Your profile appears in the box below. Sometimes more than one appears, so
you must locate your name and double-click it. You can modify any box that
has a white background. Please note, you cannot modify your Member ID.

If you have several MSN accounts with the same properties, you can only
make changes to the account you are currently logged on to. If you are not
sure which MSN account you are currently logged on to, use the following
steps:

1. Double-click the MSN icon on the desktop.

2. The MSN Sign In screen appears containing the username you are currently
  logged on as.
