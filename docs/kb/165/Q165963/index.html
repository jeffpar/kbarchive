The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1

SYMPTOMS
========


When you install Windows NT on a HP Vectra computer, Setup pauses or appears to
stop responding for a very long time at the point it is trying to copy the
Kbdus.dll from the CD-ROM.

-or-

The computer will stop responding during restart while entering GUI-mode setup
while displaying dots (for example, ...) on the blue kernel screen loading the
Fastfat.sys file.

Select [VGA MODE] when starting into GUI-mode setup to display the device driver
that causes the computer to stop responding.

After Windows NT finishes installation and you power off the computer to perform
a cold restart, Windows NT again seems to stop responding for several minutes
while displaying the dots (for example, . . . .) on the boot screen.

Once you get into Windows NT, everything works normally and a warm restart (that
is, Shutdown - Restart) starts normally without the long pause.

CAUSE
=====

This problem has been isolated to a machine BIOS setting for the secondary IDE
controller when only an IDE CD-ROM is attached.

To verify that this is the cause, perform the following steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then
  double-click the Devices icon.

2. Change the startup type of CD-ROM from system to disabled.

3. Shutdown Windows NT and perform a cold restart of the computer. If the pause
  does not occur or the system responds as expected, then communications to the
  CD-ROM is the source of the system not responding.

4. Re-enable the CD-ROM device in the Control Panel Devices tool to start at
  startup.

RESOLUTION
==========

The system BIOS has configured the secondary controller to show a CD-ROM
attached. This setting needs to be disabled. To disable the setting, perform the
following steps:

1. Go in to the system BIOS and disable the secondary controller by following
  this BIOS option tree:

  configuration
     hard drives
        hard drive #2 --&gt; enter
           auto or none - select none.  (f7 or f8 to select)

2. Exit and save the BIOS options.

3. Power off the computer and cold start it. The computer should start normally
  and not pause while starting Windows NT. After you log on, you should have
  access to the CD-ROM drive.
