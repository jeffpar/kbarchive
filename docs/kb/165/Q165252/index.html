SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to set the default border for Borders and Shading with Visual
Basic for Applications commands, the new default is not reflected when viewing
the Borders and Shading dialog box (on the the Format menu).

However, the change is evident when viewing the Tables and Borders toolbar.

CAUSE
=====

article assumes that you are familiar with the programming language being
demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug procedures. Microsoft

By design, the Borders and Shading dialog box always shows the state of the
current selection or insertion point location.

The Tables and Borders toolbar is used for applying borders or drawing tables,
and is not linked to the setting in the Borders and Shading dialog box.

The following example Visual Basic for Applications macro demonstrates this
behavior:

     Sub SetDefaultBorder()
        Options.DefaultBorderLineStyle = wdLineStyleDouble
        Options.DefaultBorderLineWidth = wdLineWidth150pt
     End Sub

WORKAROUND
==========

To set a default border weight and style to appear in the Borders and Shading
dialog box, you can use the following example Visual Basic for Applications
macro and assign the macro to a menu item:

     Sub SetDefaultBorderDialog()
        With Dialogs(wdDialogFormatBordersAndShading)
           .TopBorder = wdLineStyleDouble
           .LeftBorder = wdLineStyleDouble
           .BottomBorder = wdLineStyleDouble
           .RightBorder = wdLineStyleDouble
           .TopWeight = wdLineWidth225pt
           .LeftWeight = wdLineWidth225pt
           .BottomWeight = wdLineWidth225pt
           .RightWeight = wdLineWidth225pt
           .Show
        End With
     End Sub
