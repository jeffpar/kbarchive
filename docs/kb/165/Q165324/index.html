SUMMARY
=======

This article contains helpful information for troubleshooting Microsoft Exchange
Site Connector problems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is a checklist of questions that you need to ask when confronted
with a Site connector that isn't functioning properly.

1. Is this a new installation or a connector that had been working for a while
  that broke?

2. Are both Microsoft Exchange Servers in the same Organization? An exact match,
  including spelling and case, is required.

3. Do both Microsoft Exchange Servers use the same Service Account?

4. Are the two Microsoft Exchange Servers in trusted, untrusted, or the same NT
  domain?

5. If the domains are untrusted, is at least one Microsoft Exchange Server a
  Domain Controller? This is required.

6. If you are configuring a new Site Connector between untrusted domains have
  you followed the instructions in the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base?

  Q154624 : XCON: Configuring the Site Connector Between Untrusted Domains

  If one of the servers is a Member Server, you must use the Microsoft Exchange
  Administrator program on the Member server to configure the Site Connector
  for both servers. You won't be able to correctly configure the Site Connector
  from the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program on the Domain Controller
  server.

7. If the two Microsoft Exchange Servers are in Trusted Domains but each Server
  has a different Service Account, do both Servers use the other Server's
  service account on their connector's Override page?

  We recommended the use of the Microsoft Exchange service account on the
  override page even in trusted domains. That way, if something happens to the
  trust relationship between the two domains, the connector will still be able
  to function.

  If you elect not to use the override page in a trusted domain environment,
  make sure that the other domain's Microsoft Exchange service account is given
  Service Account Admin rights to both the Site and Configuration containers on
  the local Server.

Troubleshooting Network Connectivity for the Site Connector

1. Is this a brand new installation or a working setup that stopped working?

  If this was working, check for what may have changed or broken; things such as
  service account changes, service account password changes, problems with the
  trust relationship between the domains, network problems, addition of network
  cards, additions or deletions or modifications of protocols, changes to the
  Server's RPC binding order, changes in the network configuration, changes
  made to DNS or WINS, and so forth.

2. If using TCP/IP, can you PING the IP address of the other server? Can they
  PING you?

3. If you PING -a the other server's IP address, does it resolve the hostname?
  Is the returned hostname the other server's Server Name? Can the other server
  do the same to you?

4. What procedure is used to resolve hostnames, for example, DNS, WINS, Hosts
  file, and so forth?

5. When troubleshooting WINS problems, check the system log for the following
  error:

     There are no logon servers available to service the logon request.


  For more information about this error, please see the following article in the
  Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q139410 in the NT Database for more information. : Err Msg: There are
  Currently No Logon Servers Available...


6. What protocols are installed on both computers?

7. Was the latest Windows NT Service Pack reapplied after making changes to the
  system that may have copied older files to the server? This is especially
  important when changes or additions were made to protocols on the server.

8. Can you connect from Server1 to Server2 using the following command?

  NET USE \\&lt;server2&gt;\IPC$ /USER:&lt;domain2&gt;\&lt;service account
  2&gt;

  Can Server2 connect to Server1?

9. After the connection is made, can you view the shares on the other server?

  NET VIEW &lt;server2&gt;

  Can the other server see your shares?

10. After making the IPC$ connection, can you RPC Ping on all protocols in both
  directions with security? Which protocols work? Do some only work without
  security?

11. By default, Microsoft Exchange will use RPC first over TCP, then over IPX,
  and finally over Vines. If you encounter problems with the Site Connector or
  Servers in the same Site working over TCP/IP, you can switch to using named
  pipes to verify there is a problem with TCP/IP.

  RPC Server Bindings are controlled by the following registry entry:

      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Exchange\Exchange Provider
                        \Rpc_Svr_Binding_Order.
  

  The default string is "ncacn_ip_tcp,ncacn_spx,ncacn_vns_spp".

  For testing purposes, you can set the Site Connector to work over Named Pipes
  or NetBEUI by adding either ncacn_np or ncacn_nb_nb to the beginning of the
  string.

  Neither NetBEUI or Named Pipes is used for Server to Server communications by
  default because they do not support full RPC functionality and open a
  potential security hole, respectively. They should only be used in a test
  mode when you want to bypass the default protocols during testing.

12. Does either server have Dual NIC cards? We've seen several cases where this
  caused problems.

13. Does either server have an FDDI card and was it just added? If so, make sure
  the MTU Size is configured correctly. The symptoms of the problems will be
  that mail won't move between two Servers in the same Site or over a Site
  connector. The Network Administrator should know how to configure the MTU
  Sizes for their FDDI Cards. For more information about this problem, please
  see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q138575 : Communication Fails Through Ethernet Segment Between FDDI Rings

  Q140375 : Devault MTU Size for Different Network Topology


  Did it work before the FDDI card was added?

14. When troubleshooting network problems, check the Windows NT Event Viewer
  System log for error 3013.


15. Verify that the Microsoft Exchange Server has the following 9 files in the
  server's system32 directory, RPC requires them to function correctly. If any
  of them are missing, protocol sequences can fail.

  Rpcltc1.dll, Rpcltc8.dll, Rpcltccm.dll, Rpclts1.dll, Rpclts8.dll,
  Rpcltscm.dll, Rpcns4.dll, Rpcrt4.dll, Rpcss.exe

  In particular, look for a missing Rpcltccm.dll. We've encountered some cases
  where this file is missing after upgrading from Windows NT 3.51 to 4.0. If
  this file is missing, RPC over TCP/IP will fail. However, RPC over Name
  Pipes will still work.

  These files can be copied from a similar Windows NT Server with the same
  Service Pack(s) installed. They can also be expanded from the Windows NT 4.0
  Server compact disk.

  a. Copy Expand.exe from the Windows NT Server compact disk to a directory on
     your hard disk drive. Any directory that is in your PATH will work.

  b. Insert the Windows NT Server compact disk where files will be found.

  c. At a command prompt, change to the directory where the files to be
     expanded are located. For example, type the following at the command
     prompt:

  EXPAND E:\i386\filename.dl_ c:\winnt\system32\filename.dll

  If you try to expand a file that is already expanded, you will receive the
  following message:

  Input file &lt;filename&gt; already in expanded format

  where &lt;filename&gt; is the name of the file you attempted to expand.

16. Verify the registry values for RPC DLL files. We've encountered cases where
  these have been messed up. At least some cases were after an upgrade to
  Windows NT 4.0.

  The Windows NT 4.0 operating system normally has registry keys for
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Rpc\ServerProtocols and
  ClientProtocols that look like the following:

      Key Name:        SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Rpc\ServerProtocols

      ncacn_ip_tcp     REG_SZ :    RpcLtScm.Dll
      ncacn_nb_ipx     REG_SZ : RpcLtScm.Dll
      ncacn_nb_nb      REG_SZ : RpcLtScm.Dll
      ncacn_nb_tcp     REG_SZ : RpcLtScm.Dll
      ncacn_np         REG_SZ : rpclts1.dll
      ncacn_spx        REG_SZ : RpcLtScm.Dll
      ncadg_ip_udp     REG_SZ : RpcLtScm.Dll
      ncadg_ipx        REG_SZ : RpcLtScm.Dll
      ncalrpc          REG_SZ : ncalrpc

      Key Name:        SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Rpc\ClientProtocols

      ncacn_ip_tcp     REG_SZ :    RpcLtCcm.Dll
      ncacn_nb_ipx     REG_SZ : RpcLtccm.Dll
      ncacn_nb_nb      REG_SZ : RpcLtccm.Dll
      ncacn_nb_tcp     REG_SZ : RpcLtccm.Dll
      ncacn_np         REG_SZ : rpcltc1.dll
      ncacn_spx        REG_SZ : RpcLtCcm.Dll
      ncadg_ip_udp     REG_SZ : RpcLtCcm.Dll
      ncadg_ipx        REG_SZ : RpcLtCcm.Dll
      ncalrpc          REG_SZ : ncalrpc
  

  If you see incorrect registry entries, removing and re-adding TCP/IP is the
  cleanest way to make sure the registry is updated correctly.

17. Turn the MTA's diagnostic logging for the Operating System and Interface
  categories to maximum. Then inspect the Application log for any network
  problems?

Testing the Site Connector

1. Create X.400 custom recipients

  Create a new Custom Recipient with an X.400 address type on your Server for
  one of the mailboxes on the other Microsoft Exchange Server. These two Custom
  Recipients (one on each of the Microsoft Exchange Servers) will be used to
  test the Connector.

  IMPORTANT NOTE: Do not add a Directory Replication Connector until mail
  capabilities have been fully confirmed. If your Connector is not working the
  Directory Replication Connector will rapidly clog the queue and error logs.

  To create a correctly addressed Custom Recipient do the following:

  a. Start the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program on both Server1 and
     Server2.

  b. On Server1, select New Custom Recipient from the File menu.

  c. If prompted to select the correct container, click OK.

  d. Highlight X.400 Address and click OK.

  e. On Server2, highlight a local mailbox in either the Global Address List or
     the Recipients containers. Then select Properties from the File menu.

  f. Click the E-mail Addresses tab.

  g. Highlight the X.400 E-mail address and click the Edit button.

  h. On Server1, fill in each of the fields exactly (including case and any
     spaces) as they are displayed on Server2. In particular, watch for a space
     on the ADMD (a): field of Server2. If the ADMD field appears blank, it
     probably has a space in it. You can check by moving the cursor to the
     field and using the left and right arrows to move within the field.
     Server1's address must match Server2's mailbox exactly.

  i. When finished filling out all fields on Server1, click OK.

  j. You will then be presented with a set of Property pages that are similar
     to what you see when you create a new mailbox. You must fill in at least
     the Display and Alias fields. The display name and alias you choose at
     this point can be whatever you want. It can match the information from
     Server2, but does not have to. After you have filled in the fields, click
     OK

  You have now created a Custom Recipient on Server1 for a mailbox on Server2.
  To allow for testing in both directions, repeat steps a-j above, but switch
  Server1 and Server2 around.

2. Send test messages in both directions to verify the connector works.
