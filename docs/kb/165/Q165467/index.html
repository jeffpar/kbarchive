SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to set up a Windows-based program in the same home
folder on a computer that is configured to boot multiple versions of Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To set up a Windows-based program on a dual-boot computer so that you can run
the program from either version of Windows and share a common folder for the
program, follow these steps:

1. Verify that the program is compatible with both operating systems.

2. Start Windows (either version) and install the program following the
  manufacturer's instructions.

3. Boot the other version of Windows. Install the program in the same folder as
  in step 2.

The installation of a Windows-based program generally involves adding files and
information to the program's folder and the Windows folder. The Windows folder
holds files that are shared with other Windows-based programs, and links to the
programs (icons) that are used to start the programs. Programs also may write
information to .ini or registry files in the Windows folder.

If a program is installed in only one version of Windows in a dual-boot
situation, information that may be required to run the program is not available
to the version of Windows in which the program has not been installed.

Note that when you make changes to options within a program, those changes may
not be recognized in the other version of Windows and may need to be configured
while you are running the program in the other version of Windows. This occurs
when the configuration options are contained in the registry or in .ini files in
the Windows folder.
