MORE INFORMATION
================

Windbg Cannot Use Visual C++ 5.0 Debugging Information
------------------------------------------------------

Because of changes to the format of debugging information in Visual C++ 5.0, you
will not be able to use any version of Windbg prior to 5.0.1719. The Windbg
debugger (distributed in the Win32 SDK) to do source level debugging of programs
created with Visual C++ 5.0.

_declspec(novtable)
-------------------

This form of _declspec can be applied to any class declaration, but should only
be applied to pure interface classes, i.e. classes that will never be
instantiated on their own. The _declspec stops the compiler from generating code
to initialize the vfptr in the constructor(s) and destructor of the class. In
many cases, this removes the only references to the vtable that are associated
with the class and, thus, the linker will remove it. Using this form of
_declspec can result in a significant reduction in code size.

_ATL_MIN_CRT and Link Error "unresolved external symbol _main"
--------------------------------------------------------------

When you build a Release version of an ATL project, you can get the following
link error:

  LIBCMT.LIB(crt0.obj) : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _main

This error occurs if you are using CRT functions that require CRT startup code.
The Release configuration defines _ATL_MIN_CRT, which excludes CRT startup code
from your EXE or DLL.

To avoid this error, do one of the following:

- Remove _ATL_MIN_CRT from the list of preprocessor defines to allow CRT
  startup code to be included. On the Project menu, click Settings. In the
  Settings For: drop down list, choose Multiple Configurations. In the Select
  project configuration(s) to modify dialog box that appears, click the check
  boxes for all Release versions, and then click OK. On the C/C++ tab, choose
  the General category. Remove _ATL_MIN_CRT from the Preprocessor definitions
  edit box.

- If possible, remove calls to CRT functions that require CRT startup code.
  Instead, use their Win32 equivalents. For example, use lstrcmp instead of
  strcmp. Known functions that require CRT startup code are some of the string
  and floating point functions.

DCOM95 Available for Distributed Applications
---------------------------------------------

The Microsoft Distributed COM (DCOM) files for Windows 95 are useful for creating
distributed applications. Some Visual C++ 5.0 samples require DCOM. You can find
DCOM95 in the \dcom95 directory on the disc that includes "Microsoft Visual C++"
on the label. (Disc 1 if you purchased Visual C++; Disc 3 if you purchased
Visual Studio.) Check out the Visual C++ 5.0 Compiler COM support and Active
Template Library ( ATL) with DCOM95.

/WS:AGGRESSIVE (Aggressively Trim Process Memory)
-------------------------------------------------

Use this linker option to add the WS_AGGRESSIVE attribute to your application's
image. The Windows NT 4.0 loader will recognize this attribute and aggressively
trim the working set of the process when it is not active. Using this option is
similar to adding the following call throughout your application:

     SetProcessWorkingSetSize(hThisProcess, -1, -1)

/WS:AGGRESSIVE can be used for applications that must have a low impact on the
system's memory pool.

If the speed of your application is important, do not use /WS:AGGRESSIVE without
testing the resulting performance implications. Ideal candidates are processes
that tend to operate in the background, such as services and screen savers.

/FD (Generate File Dependencies)
--------------------------------

The development environment's build system uses the /FD option to ensure that the
most reliable dependency information is used when it builds your project.

_MSC_EXTENSIONS Compiler Macro
------------------------------

This macro is defined unless you compile with /Za for ANSI compatibility. Its
value, when defined, is 1.

Option Precedence and the CL Environment Variable
-------------------------------------------------

Compiler options are processed "left to right", and when a conflict is detected,
the last (right-most) option wins. The CL environment variable is processed
before the command line, so in any conflicts between CL and the command line,
the command line takes precedence.

/Zm (Specify Memory Allocation Limit)
-------------------------------------

The compiler uses a number of discrete heaps, each of which has a finite limit.
The total of the size limits for all heaps is about 105 MB, but when any one
heap is exhausted, the compiler cannot continue. Memory is allocated only as
needed; the 105 MB limit is just to keep from using too much memory. Exceeding
any one of the discrete-heap size limits occurs only in rare circumstances
involving very large or very complex programs. Should your program exceed one of
these limits, use /Zm to scale the total size of all the limits. For example,
when /Zm200 is specified, the total of all heap size limits is 210MB.

Compiler Now Documents Type Library Dependencies
------------------------------------------------

The compiler provides the full path to any typelib dependency required by the
typelib it is currently processing. The path is written, in the form of
comments, into the typelib header (.TLH) that the compiler generates for each
processed typelib.

If a typelib includes references to types defined in other typelibs, then the
.TLH file will include comments of the following sort:

     // 

     // Cross-referenced type libraries:

     // 

     //  #import "c:\path\typelib0.tlb"

     // 

The actual filename in the #import comment is the full path of the cross-
referenced typelib, as stored in the registry. If you encounter errors that are
due to missing type definitions, check the comments at the head of the .TLH to
see which dependent typelibs may need to be imported first. Likely errors are
syntax errors (e.g. C2143, C2146, C2321), C2501 (missing decl- specifiers), or
C2433 ('inline' not permitted on data declaration) while compiling the .TLI
file.

You must determine which of the dependency comments are not otherwise provided
for by system headers and then provide an #import directive at some point before
the #import directive of the dependent typelib in order to resolve the errors.

Keywords _emul and _emulu Not Documented
----------------------------------------

Syntax:

     _int64 _emul(long, long);

     unsigned _int64 _emulu(unsigned long, unsigned long);

Use these keywords to efficiently multiply two 32-bit integer numbers, which
return a 64-bit result.

New Linker Error: Linker Tools Error LNK1189
--------------------------------------------

     LIBTOOMANYMEMBERS:: library limit of number objects exceeded

The limit of 65535 objects or members in a library has been exceeded.

Benefit of Using the Linker's /OPT:ICF Option
---------------------------------------------

The /OPT:ICF[,iterations] option removes identical COMDAT records in order to
reduce the size of the executable produced by the linker. The iterations value
specifies the number of times to repeat the search for identical COMDAT records.
If /OPT:REF is specified, /OPT:ICF is on by default unless you specify
/OPT:NOICF as well.

Debugging Windows API functions with NT Symbols Loaded
------------------------------------------------------

If you have the NT symbols loaded and you want to debug Windows API functions,
you need to enter the decorated name of the function while setting a breakpoint
on the function. For example, if you want to set breakpoint on the MessageBeep
function, use the decorated name _MessageBeep@4. The decorated name can be
obtained in the map file created through linker options.

If Screen Flashes During Build or the Wrong Code Page is used When Debugging a
Console Application

If you are using Windows 95, delete any of the following files from your
computer:

- _DEFAULT.PIF

- DEFAULT.PIF

- CONAGENT.PIF

These files were used by Windows 3.x, and are not needed by Windows 95. If they
are used, while you are debugging a console application, the country settings
associated with the PIF files will be used, and could result in the wrong code
page being loaded. A result of their use on Windows 95 may be screen flashing
during a Build, if you have specified console windows to be full screen.

Incorrect Documentation for the Clean Menu Command
--------------------------------------------------

The Clean command is incorrectly documented in the "Remove Intermediate Files"
topic as follows:

  You can remove all files from the intermediate directories in any
  project configuration in your project workspace.

In actuality, the Clean command will not remove precompiled header (.PCH) files.
This is by design, as the initial generation of .PCH files is time consuming. If
the project is a server project that has been registered on the system, the
registry entries will not be cleaned up. The final result of the of using the
Clean command is to delete all executable (.EXE), dynamic link library (.DLL),
and Control (.OCX) files.

MIDL2020: error generating type library: save all changes failed
----------------------------------------------------------------

This error can result if the path to the .IDL file is longer than 126 characters,
which is because oleaut32.dll does not currently support path names that are
greater than 126 characters. The workaround is to reduce the path to the .IDL
file so that it is less than 126 characters.

Error RC2104 : undefined keyword or key name: MFT_STRING
--------------------------------------------------------

If you encounter this error, open MCL\MFC\Include\AfxRes.h and add the following
include directive:

     #include &lt;winresrc.h&gt;

Error Command Line Warning MIDL1009 : unknown argument ignored
--------------------------------------------------------------

MIDL.exe version 3.01.75 generates this error if its arguments are passed in a
response file and one of the arguments is an MBCS-character file name that
contains a space.

Workarounds:

- Use a batch file to invoke MIDL with its arguments.

- Delete the space from the MBCS file name.

Additional Information on the C2065 Compiler Error
--------------------------------------------------

The following information belongs in the tips section of the C2065 compiler
error:

Make sure you're using proper namespace scope. For example, in order to properly
resolve ANSI C++ Standard Library functions and operators, you must state that
you're using the std namespace with the using directive.

For example, unless the using directive is uncommented, the following sample will
fail to compile because the cout stream is defined in the std namespace:

     #include &lt;iostream&gt;

     // using namespace std;

     void main()

     {
       cout &lt;&lt; "Hello" &gt;&gt; endl;
     }

Documentation for Error C2712 Incomplete
----------------------------------------

The documentation for this error should also contain the following information:

The error can be avoided when using the /GX option by not having local variables
or parameters with types that have destructors in a function that uses
structured exception handling (SEH). Furthermore, SEH cannot be used in
constructors or destructors if using /GX. Code that requires SEH can also be
moved to another function in order to avoid the error.

Compiler Warning C2498
----------------------

  C2498 : "%$S' 'novtable' can only be applied to class declarations"

For example, using __declspec(novtable) with a function, as follows, is illegal:

     void __declspec(novtable) f() {
     }

Compiler Warning (level 4) C4238
--------------------------------

  nonstandard extension used : class rvalue used as lvalue

This error occurs when you are using Microsoft language extensions (/Ze) and use
a class type as is an rvalue in a context that implicitly or explicitly takes
its address. For example:

     struct C
     {
       C();
     };

     C * pC = &amp;C(); // yields C4238

This usage is not permitted by the C++ Working Paper, and in some cases (such as
the example above) can be quite dangerous. This usage is being permitted under
/Ze for compatibility with previous versions of the compiler, which did not flag
this error. This usage is not permitted under /Za.

Compiler Warning (level 3) C4800
--------------------------------

  'type' : forcing value to bool 'true' or 'false' (performance warning)

This warning is generated when some non-bool value is assigned or coerced into
type bool. Typically, this message is caused by assigning int variables to bool
variables where the int variable contains only values true and false, and could
be redeclared as type bool. If you can't rewrite the expression to use type
bool, then you can add "!=0" to the expression, which gives the expression type
bool. Casting the expression to type bool will not disable the warning, which is
by design.

Compiler Warning (level 1) C4804
--------------------------------

  '%$L' : unsafe use of type 'bool' in operation

This warning is for unary operations and is generated when you used a bool
variable or value in an unexpected way. For example, if you use operators such
as the negative unary operator (-) or the complement operator (~).

Compiler Warning (level 1) C4805
--------------------------------

  '%$L' : unsafe mix of type 'type' and type 'type' in operation

This message is similar to C4804, and it is limited to binary operations. It is
generated for operations such as b &amp;= i, b+=i, b/=b, b%=i, etc., where b and
i are bool and int respectively .

Compiler Warning (level 1) C4806
--------------------------------

  '%$L' : unsafe operation: no value of type 'type' promoted to type
  'type' can equal the given constant

This message warns against serious errors such as b == 3, where b has type bool.
The promotion rules cause bool to be promoted to int. This is legal according to
the ANSI C++ Working Paper, but it can never be true.

Compiler Warning (level 1) C4807
--------------------------------

  '%$L' : unsafe mix of type 'type' and signed bitfield of type 'type'

This warning is generated when comparing a one-bit signed bit field to a bool
variable. Since a one-bit signed bit field can only contain the values -1 or 0,
it is dangerous to compare it to bool. No warnings are generated about mixing
bool and one-bit unsigned bitfields since they are identical to bool and can
only hold 0 or 1.

Compiler Warnings (level 1) C4808
---------------------------------

  case '%d' is not a valid value for switch condition of type 'bool'

This warning occurs if a switch condition is of type bool and one of the case
values is outside the range of bool (that is, true and false). Only true, false,
1, 0, and default are valid case values if the switch condition is of type
bool.

Compiler Warning (level 1) C4809
--------------------------------

  switch statement has redundant 'default' label; all possible 'case'
  labels are given

This message is generated in places where you have both 'true' and 'false' cases
in addition to a default label.
