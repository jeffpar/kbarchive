SYMPTOMS
========

When your Visual Basic for Applications macro creates an object variable that is
set to reference a picture object, and if your macro later anchors a hyperlink
to the picture object, the object reference is deleted and the following error
message appears:

  Run-time error '5825': Object has been deleted

For example, the following Visual Basic for Applications macro adds a hyperlink
to an already linked picture. The hyperlink is "anchored" to the picture object
referenced by the InLine Picture object variable oILPic. Once the hyperlink is
added, the object variable reference oILPic is deleted.

     Sub DoInLineShapeHyperlink()
        Dim oDoc As Document
        Dim oILPic As InlineShape
        Dim oHLink As Hyperlink
        Dim sPicFile As String
        Dim sLinkFile as String
        sPicFile = "&lt;Your Graphic File Path and Name&gt;"
        sLinkFile = "&lt;Your HyperLink File Path and Name&gt;"
        ' Create new document.
        Set oDoc = Documents.Add
        ' Insert a picture.
        Set oILPic = oDoc.InlineShapes.AddPicture _
           (Range:=oDoc.Content, FileName:=sPicFile, LinkToFile:=True)
        ' Add a hyperlink for the picture.
        oDoc.Hyperlinks.Add Anchor:=oILPic.Range, Address:=sLinkFile
        ' The error occurs here because oILPic is no longer valid.
        Set oHLink = oILPic.Hyperlink
     End Sub

CAUSE
=====

The "Object has been deleted" error message appears because the macro has
attempted to access an object that has been deleted. The object may have been
deleted deliberately, such as with the Delete method, or it may have been
deleted as a side effect of another operation, such as when a frame is added
around an inline shape, which deletes the original inline shape and creates a
copy of it in the frame.

article assumes that you are familiar with the programming language being
demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug procedures. Microsoft
support professionals can help explain the functionality of a particular
procedure, but they will not modify these examples to provide added
functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific needs. If you have
limited programming experience, you may want to contact a Microsoft Certified
Partner or the Microsoft fee-based consulting line at (800) 936-5200. For more

For more information about the support options that are available and about how
to contact Microsoft, visit the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

To work around this problem, reference the object directly, as in the following
example:

     Private Sub DoInLineShapeHyperlink()
        Dim oDoc As Document
        Dim oILPic As InlineShape
        Dim oHLink As Hyperlink
        Dim sPicFile As String
        Dim sLinkFile as String
        sPicFile = "&lt;Your Graphic File Path and Name&gt;"
        sLinkFile = "&lt;Your HyperLink File Path and Name&gt;"
        ' Create new document.
        Set oDoc = Documents.Add
        ' Insert a picture.
        Set oILPic = oDoc.InlineShapes.AddPicture _
        (Range:=oDoc.Content, FileName:= sPicFile, LinkToFile:=True)
        ' Add a hyperlink for the picture.
        oDoc.Hyperlinks.Add Anchor:=oILPic.Range, Address:=sLinkFile
        ' Use the InlineShapes Property to reference the object.
        Set oHLink = oDoc.InlineShapes(1).Hyperlink
     End Sub

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use the IsObjectValid method to verify that an object still exists. The
following example demonstrates the use of this method:

     Sub testObject()
        Dim ilShp As InlineShape
        Set ilShp = ActiveDocument.InlineShapes.Add("C:\Windows\bubbles.bmp")
        MsgBox IsObjectValid(ilShp)     ' This will display True
        a.Delete
        MsgBox IsObjectValid(ilShp)     ' This will display False
     End Sub
