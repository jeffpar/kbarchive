MORE INFORMATION
================

Reducing the Size of Header Files for Faster Builds
---------------------------------------------------

To speed the build process, Visual C++ 5.0 provides the following new defines.
Use them to reduce the size of the Win32 header files.

- VC_EXTRALEAN

- WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN

Newly generated Visual C++ AppWizard applications automatically benefit from
VC_EXTRALEAN. You can also manually define VC_EXTRALEAN to speed the build
process of many legacy MFC applications.

Non-MFC C++ and C applications can define WIN32_EXTRA_LEAN and any applicable
NOservice defines, such as NOSOUND (see DevStudio\Vc\include\Windows.h), to
reduce their build times.

To add these defines, from the Project menu, choose Settings. The Projects
settings dialog box appears. Click the C/C++ tab. In the Category list, select
Preprocessor. Add the desired definitions to the Preprocessor Definitions box.

Several Project System and Debugger Methods are Disabled when the

BuildFinish Event is Fired
--------------------------

Consider the following VBScript event handler:

     Sub Application_BuildFinish(nNumErrors, nNumWarnings)

     if nNumErrors+nNumWarnings = 0 then
         ExecuteCommand "ToggleOutputWindow"
         ExecuteConfiguration
     end if

     End Sub

ExecuteConfiguration fails because the BuildFinish event is fired before several
project system and debugger commands have been re-enabled. The methods that
invoke these commands, like ExecuteConfiguration, will remain disabled between
the time that the event is fired and the time the event handler returns. After
the Application_BuildFinish event handler returns, these methods will be
re-enabled.

Workaround

1. Create a new macro, for example, MyBuild, with the following code:

        Sub MyBuild
            Build
            ' Add other method calls here that can't appear in the
            ' BuildFinish event handler, such as "ExecuteConfiguration"
        End Sub

2. Always invoke a build by using this new macro instead of using the default
  Build menu command or toolbar. Note that you can create a custom menu command
  or toolbar button for your new MyBuild macro by going to the Tools menu,
  clicking Customize, and using the Commands tab of the dialog box.

The Application_BuildFinish VBScript event handler now becomes:

     Sub Application_BuildFinish(nNumErrors, nNumWarnings)

         if nNumErrors+nNumWarnings = 0 then
             ExecuteCommand "ToggleOutputWindow"
         end if
     End Sub

In this case Build will fire the BuildFinish event and return control to the
MyBuild subroutine at which time the ExecuteConfiguration will be enabled. You
can see what other methods are disabled simply by looking at the disabled menu
items when a build is in progress.

Building ATL Projects from the Command Line Can Generate NMAKE Error
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Building an ATL program from the command line can generate NMAKE error U1073.
(This problem does not occur when building ATL samples from within the
integrated development environment.)

For example, the following command line:

  NMAKE /f beeper.mak CFG="beeper - Win32 Release"

will generate this error:

  NMAKE : fatal error U1073: don't know how to make '".\beeper.h"'

From the command line, ATL projects require two passes to build. The first pass
directs MIDL to create a header file that is required for the second pass.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the following commands to work around this problem:

  nmake /f beeper.mak CFG="beeper - Win32 Release" beeper.h
  nmake /f beeper.mak CFG="beeper - Win32 Release"

Help File Names with European Characters Do Not Copy Correctly on
Windows 95
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Help compiler converts the name of the Help file into upper case characters.
On Windows 95, this causes problems when the Visual Studio Build System tries to
copy a name that contains European characters (such as umlauted characters) to
the output directory for the rest of the project build. This is not a problem on
Windows NT.

Add a copy step with the name of the Help file, in upper case, to the custom
build rule on the .hpj file in the project.
