-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Windows NT computer that is configured to use an LMHOSTS file may get a blue
screen error during the use of the NBTSTAT -R command, and the subsequent
restart of the system. The blue screen error message for this condition is:

  STOP: 0x0000001E (0xC0000028, 0x801327E1, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)
  KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED

NOTE: The first and fourth parameters will be identical on a single processor
x86-based system.

-or-

  STOP: 0x0000007F (0x00000008, 0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000000)
  UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP

NOTE: The first parameter will be identical on a single processor x86- based
system.

CAUSE
=====

Improperly formatted syntax in the LMHOSTS file can produce this STOP error.
Below is an example of the specific syntax error that causes the STOP error:

     #include //severname/share/file

The problem with the above line is that the slash (/) is used instead of the
backslash (\).


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, correctly format the LMHOSTS file.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


MORE INFORMATION
================

The LMHOSTS file may be deleted by the system during the Stop error. If the file
is not deleted, the system may become caught in a loop, producing the STOP error
each time the file is read while the computer is starting. To correct this
problem, the LMHOSTS will need to be deleted or have the incorrect entries
edited out. The method used for this will depend on the file system being used
on the computer running Windows NT.

Windows NT Installed on FAT Drive
---------------------------------

If your computer running Windows NT is FAT-formatted, perform the following
steps:

1. Start the computer to another operating system (such as MS-DOS, Microsoft
  Windows 95, or Microsoft Windows 3.x).

2. Delete or edit the incorrect entry from the LMHOSTS file in the
  Winnt\System32\Drivers\Etc folder.

If you do not have MS-DOS or Windows 95 installed on the Windows NT computer
(there is no menu option for MS-DOS or Windows 95 on the Start menu), but
Windows NT is installed on a FAT partition, you can boot from an MS-DOS floppy
disk or Windows 95 Startup disk and edit or delete the LMHOSTS file on the FAT
partition.

Windows NT Installed on NTFS Drive
----------------------------------

If your computer running Windows NT is NTFS-formatted, perform the following
steps:

1. Install a parallel copy of Windows NT into a new directory.

2. Delete or edit the incorrect entry from the LMHOSTS file.

3. Restart into the original Windows NT installation and delete the parallel
  installation of Windows NT.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.


Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. A
supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
