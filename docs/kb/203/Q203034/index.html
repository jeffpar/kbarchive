The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Exchange Internet Mail Service has the capability to route e-mail for other
e-mail domains. Replies from "Internet" custom recipients back to the Internet
may contain the wrong Reply To address.

For example: Set up Internet custom recipients on Exchange Server with a target
e-mail address of user@&lt;remotedomain&gt;.com. Then add a new second Internet
address of user@&lt;localdomain&gt;.com. The custom recipient can now receive
e-mail at user@&lt;localdomain&gt;.com, and have it forwarded to the target
address of user@&lt;remotedomain&gt;.com. Now, the receiving mailbox
(user@&lt;remotedomain&gt;.com) can reply to this message, sending it back to
Exchange Server to be relayed on to the Internet to the originator of the
initial message. This reply message could have the wrong Reply To address.

CAUSE
=====

This was normal for the Internet Mail Service. In this situation, the Internet
Mail Service is acting as a relay agent for the reply message. Incoming SMTP
mail to Exchange Server will be relayed back to the sender with no modification
of the sender's address (the sender being the original recipient of this reply
message = user@&lt;remotedomain&gt;.com). Setting the Reply To address on the
custom recipient to user@localdomain.com has no effect because the SMTP message
is simply relayed and not compared to the directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

The behavior has been changed in the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack. To
resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.

number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q238471 XIMS: How to Force SMTP Messages Through the Information Store

For information regarding Exchange 5.0, see the "Workaround" section below.

WORKAROUND
==========

The e-mail system where the user's mailbox resides
(user@&lt;remotedomain&gt;.com) must update the user's mailbox with the correct
Reply To address.
