SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how to map a client certificate to a Windows NT user
account. When this is done, the resources available to the client browsing the
Web site are determined by that user account's permissions in the Access Control
Lists (ACLs).

MORE INFORMATION
================

To map a client certificate to a user account, IIS must have access to a file
that contains the ASCII text of that certificate. Because this is not typically
available to the IIS computer, ASP is used to retrieve that information from the
certificate, and then save it to a file on the server.

The Obtaining Client Certificate Information with ASP topic in the Windows NT
Option Pack product documentation explains how to do this. However, a limitation
of that code is that it creates the same file for all certificates.

To address this, the ASP code provided in this article creates a separate file
for each certificate so that a file corresponding to each client is available
for IIS to map to a user account.

NOTE: This ASP code appends the certificate's information to the text file every
time the certificate is used to browse the ASP file. Because of this, you may
want to take steps so that this information is only obtained once. Otherwise,
the text file will grow in size indefinitely. To do this, use one of the
following methods:

- Instruct the clients to only browse to the ASP file one time, in order to
  "initialize" their mappings. Afterward, they should browse directly to the
  other files used in that Web site or directory, bypassing the ASP file that
  creates the text file.

-or-

- Add code to the ASP file to detect if a text file has already been created
  for the certificate.

NOTE: Because they use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), which encrypts and
decrypts all data transmitted, pages that require certificates (which use the
secure HTTPS protocol) load slower than pages that use the unsecured HTTP
protocol.

1. Create an ASP file, which the client will initially browse to in order to
  provide the client information that will be mapped to a user account. In the
  ASP file, add the following code above the &lt;HTML&gt; tag:

  &lt;% @Language = VBScript %&gt;
  &lt;% 'Response.Buffer = True %&gt;

2. Next, add the following code between the &lt;BODY&gt; and &lt;/BODY&gt;tags.

  NOTE: In the "Set outStream = fs.OpenTextFile?" line, change the file path to
  the directory that will contain the text files on your server.

  &lt;%  
  'Obtain client name
  cname = Request.ClientCertificate("SubjectCN")

  'Instantiate the ASP FileSystemObject in order to create a text file
  Set fs = Server.CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")

  'Create text file using append mode. The client name is used to create the file name. 
  Set outStream = fs.OpenTextFile( "c:\InetPub\wwwroot\ClientFiles\" &amp; cname &amp;".txt" , 8, True )

  'Save certificate issuer information to text file
  outStream.WriteLine( "# Issuer: " &amp; Request.ClientCertificate("Issuer") )

  'Extract certificate subject (user) and account information
  'from certificate         
  su = Request.ClientCertificate( "Subject" )
  mx = len(su)         
  for x = 1 to mx
    if mid(su,x,1)=chr(10) or mid(su,x,1)=chr(13) then
      su=left(su,x-1)+";"+right(su,mx-x)     
    end if         
  next
  outStream.WriteLine( "# Subject: " &amp; su )
  outStream.WriteLine( "# Account: " &amp; Request.ServerVariables("REMOTE_USER"))

  'Extract encrypted certificate text from certificate; encode text as 64-bit data 
  uue = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789+/"
  outStream.WriteLine( "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----" )
  cer = Request.ClientCertificate( "Certificate" )
  lcer = len(cer)         
  l = 0         
  for x = 1 to lcer step 3
    a1 = asc(mid(cer,x,1))            
      if x+1 &lt;= lcer then
        a2 = asc(mid(cer,x+1,1))                
          if x+2 &lt;=lcer then
            a3 = asc(mid(cer,x+2,1))                
          else
            a3 = 0                
          end if            
      else
        a2 = 0                
        a3 = 0            
      end if
      outStream.Write mid(uue, (a1 and 252)/4 +1 ,1)
      outStream.Write mid(uue, (a1 and 3)*16 + (a2 and 240)/16 +1 ,1)
      if x+1 &lt;= lcer then
        outStream.Write mid(uue, (a2 and 15)*4 + (a3 and 192)/64 +1 ,1)
          if x+2 &lt;= lcer then
            outStream.Write mid(uue, (a3 and 63) +1 ,1)
          else                    
            outStream.Write "="
          end if            
      else                
        outStream.Write "=="
      end if            
      l = l +4            
      if l = 64 then
        outStream.WriteLine("")                
        l = 0            
      end if
    next         

  if l &gt; 0 then       
    outStream.WriteLine( "" )
  end if         
  outStream.WriteLine( "-----END CERTIFICATE-----" )
         
  Response.Write "Client certificate information has been received and logged successfully&lt;br&gt;"
  %&gt;

3. Save the ASP file to the Web site or directory.

4. Start the Internet Service Manager (ISM), which loads the Internet
  Information Server snap-in for the Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

5. Right-click the Web site or directory that will contain the client text
  files, and then click Properties.

6. On the Directory (or Home Directory) tab, make sure that Write access
  permission is selected. This will allow the ASP file to create the text files
  in that directory. Click OK to return to the MMC.

7. Create and install a server certificate and key pair on the IIS computer.

  NOTE: For information on how to do this using Microsoft Certificate Server,
  see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q218445 How to Configure Certificate Server for Use with SSL on IIS

8. In the MMC, right-click the Web site or directory where you will use client
  certificate mapping, and then click Properties. Click the Directory Security
  tab.

9. In the Secure Communications section, click the Edit button.

10. In the Secure Communications dialog box, select the "Require Secure Channel
  when accessing this resource" check box, and then select the Require Client
  Certificates option.

11. Have a client obtain a client certificate from the same Certificate
  Authority (CA) that issued the server's certificate.

  NOTE: For information on how to do this using Certificate Server, see the
  following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q218445 How to Configure Certificate Server for Use with SSL on IIS

12. Have the client browse to the ASP file (that you created previously to
  obtain client certificate information) using the HTTPS protocol. After the
  client has successfully browsed to the ASP file using the client
  certificate, a corresponding text file will be created on the server.

13. Select the Enable Client Certificate Mapping check box, and then click the
  Edit button.

14. In the MMC, right-click the Web site or directory again, and then click
  Properties. Click the Directory Security tab.

15. In the Secure Communications section, click the Edit button.

16. In the Secure Communications dialog box, select the Enable Client
  Certificate Mapping check box, and then click the Edit button.

17. On the Basic tab, click the Add button. Select the text file created for
  that client certificate, and then click the Open button.

18. Type a descriptive Map Name, select the Windows NT user account that the
  client certificate should be mapped to, and then provide the user account's
  password. Click OK until you return to the MMC.

The next time the client browses to a file on this Web site or directory that
requires a client certificate (using HTTPS), it will be logged on with the user
account mapped to that client certificate.
