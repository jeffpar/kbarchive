SYMPTOMS
========

When using the NET USE command to associate a remote block device to a drive
letter, if the drive letter is already being used by a local block device (such
as a RAM disk, a floppy disk, or a hard disk), the network drive overwrites the
local drive. Disconnecting the network drive causes the local drive to return.

CAUSE
=====

When MS-DOS versions 3.0 and 3.1 were current, some MS-DOS versions 1.x/2.x
applications still existed. These applications only recognize drives A and B.

Allowing a NET USE of an existing MS-DOS block device drive letter allows you to
get one of these very old applications to load, run, and read files off the
network by redirecting one or both of drives A and B to a server.

These applications are the reason the MS-DOS ASSIGN utility was written.

This feature also allows you to "transform" a machine with a very small drive C
or a machine with only a floppy disk into the equivalent of a diskless
workstation by redirecting drives A, B, and C.

STATUS
======

This is a feature of the MS-DOS redirector (both Microsoft Networks and
Microsoft LAN Manager).
