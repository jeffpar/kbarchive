<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Article: Q43560
Product(s): See article
Version(s): 4.00 4.00b 4.50
Operating System(s): MS-DOS
Keyword(s): ENDUSER | SR# S900406-139 B_BasicCom | mspl13_basic
Last Modified: 15-JAN-1991

In MS-DOS versions 3.00 and later, the full path of any executing
program is stored after the environment variables in the environment
segment that is found in the program segment prefix (PSP). This
article provides a description of how to extract the EXEC path and
gives an example of how to do this with BASIC.

This information applies to Microsoft QuickBASIC versions 4.00, 4.00b,
and 4.50, to Microsoft BASIC Compiler versions 6.00 and 6.00b for
MS-DOS, and to Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS)
versions 7.00 and 7.10.

The segment address of the PSP for the currently executing process can
be checked with the DOS Interrupt 21 hex, function 62 hex.

The environment segment can be found in the PSP at offset 2C hex. The
environment table has an entry for each environment variable of the
format &lt;name&gt;=&lt;parameter&gt;. Each entry is terminated by a null
character [CHR$(0)] and the entire table is followed by an additional
null character. After the additional null character, there is a 2-byte
word count. Immediately after the word count, the full path of the
executing program is listed as

   &lt;drive&gt;:&lt;path&gt;\&lt;filename&gt;.&lt;extension&gt;

and is also terminated by a null character.

For more information about the PSP and the environment table, see
"Advanced MS-DOS Programming, 2nd Edition" by Ray Duncan, published by
Microsoft Press (1988).

Code Example
------------

The following code example provides a function that will return the
full path of the currently executing program in DOS 3.00 and later:

'Compile and link lines:
' BC FULLPATH;
' LINK FULLPATH,,,QB.LIB;    NOTE: QBX.LIB should be used for PDS
'                                 7.00 or 7.10
'$INCLUDE: 'qb.bi'  ' NOTE: QBX.BI should be used for PDS 7.00/7.10
DECLARE FUNCTION FullPath$ ()
CONST EnvOffInPSP = &amp;H2C

PRINT FullPath$

FUNCTION FullPath$
  DIM inregs AS RegType, OutRegs AS RegType

  inregs.ax = &amp;H6200 'Get PSP
  CALL INTERRUPT(&amp;H21, inregs, OutRegs)

  PSPSeg% = OutRegs.bx
  EnvironSeg&amp; = 0
  OffSet&amp; = 0
  tmp$ = ""

  DEF SEG = PSPSeg%
    EnvironSeg&amp; = 256 * PEEK(EnvOffInPSP + 1) + PEEK(EnvOffInPSP)

  DEF SEG = EnvironSeg&amp;
    WHILE (PEEK(OffSet&amp;) &lt;&gt; 0 OR PEEK(OffSet&amp; + 1) &lt;&gt; 0)
      OffSet&amp; = OffSet&amp; + 1
    WEND

    'Skip extra bytes between Env Table and Fullpath
    OffSet&amp; = OffSet&amp; + 4

    'Build FullPath$ (until null terminates string)
    WHILE PEEK(OffSet&amp;) &lt;&gt; 0
      tmp$ = tmp$ + CHR$(PEEK(OffSet&amp;))
      OffSet&amp; = OffSet&amp; + 1
    WEND
  DEF SEG

  FullPath$ = tmp$
END FUNCTION
