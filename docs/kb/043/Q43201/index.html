<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Article: Q43201
Product(s): See article
Version(s): 4.50
Operating System(s): MS-DOS
Keyword(s): ENDUSER | SR# S890331-67 | mspl13_basic
Last Modified: 10-APR-1989

If you save a QuickBASIC Version 4.50 program in the FAST LOAD/SAVE
format and then exit to DOS and rename the file, QuickBASIC may not be
able to recognize the new filename.

The environment will either bring up an empty view window with that
filename under the OPEN file option or produce "BAD FILE MODE" when
trying to load that file as a module through the LOAD file option.

Apparently, when saving a file with the FAST LOAD/SAVE format,
QuickBASIC retains the original name of the file; therefore, if you go
to DOS and rename the file, QuickBASIC will not recognize the file
when trying to load it.

This error has not been reproduced yet, but it was reported by one
person using QuickBASIC Version 4.50. A workaround for this situation
is to exit to DOS and rename the file back to the original name when
saved under FAST LOAD/SAVE format, then enter into QuickBASIC again,
and OPEN the file. If you then want to change the name, select SAVE AS
under the FILE menu and change the name and also save it as ASCII
(Text), so that it can be read by other software.
