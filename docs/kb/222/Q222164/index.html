-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Services for NetWare version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Users can no longer access NetWare servers managed through Directory Service
Manager for NetWare (DSMN) even after their password has been reset.

This problem is very likely to happen with users who forget their password often
and the administrators always use the same password when they reset it.

DSMN does not log an event nor display an error message when this happens.

CAUSE
=====

When a user, who exists on Windows NT, forgets the password and asks the
administrators to reset it, the administrators can set the password in the
domain regardless of the password history. But, if the user's password happens
to be in the password history of a NetWare server, DSMN fails to change the
password and the user cannot log on to this server with his or her new
password.

In your Windows NT domain, you have a password history enabled of at least eight
unique passwords as suggested by the Directory Service Manager for NetWare's
online Help.

On NetWare servers running under DSMN, you still have password history turned on;
for example, because there are still user accounts not managed through Windows
NT.

When the new password is sent to the NetWare server, it returns error 0xA0
(PASSWORD_NOT_UNIQUE). DSMN ignores this error code.
