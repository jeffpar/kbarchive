IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send plain text from an Outlook client that has an Exchange Server as
the backend with the Internet Mail Service configured to send plain text or
HTML, the Internet Mail Service overrides the user's choice, and sends both
plain text and HTML. When MCI Mail or other plain text mail readers receive a
message as MIME/multipart/alternative, the recipient gets one e-mail message
with plain text at the top followed by the same message embedded in HTML tags.

CAUSE
=====

The Internet Mail Service doesn't get the sender's option in the message. As a
result it, sends both the plain text and the HTML.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or

MORE INFORMATION

In addition to the new files noted above and the client-side updates, the
following registry changes must be made to enable this functionality. To make
the registry changes, perform the following steps:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Stop the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Service and the Microsoft Exchange
  Information Store service.

  Value Name: SendPlainTextAsIs
  Data Type: REG_DWORD
  Value: 0x0, 0x1
  Default: 0x0 (not in registry by default)

After this key is set, all plain text mail generated by Outlook will be sent out
