Last Modified: 06-AUG-2002

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The SystemRole and SystemType values in the [Local] section of the Sms.ini file
are blank.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when the Hardware Inventory Frequency setting for the
site is set to a value other than Every Workstation Logon and either of the
following conditions are true:

- The LastLoggedUser value in the [Logon History] section is blank or the
  entire [Logon History] section is missing and Inv32cli.exe (the Systems
  Management Server Client Inventory Service) begins its work cycle but it is
  not yet time to take inventory. Invwin32.exe (the SMS_INVENTORY_AGENT_NT
  Service) does not exhibit this problem.

  -or-

- A client is in the process of moving from one site/domain to another and
  inventory is skipped by the Inventory Agents.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date      Time        Size      File name      Platform
  -------------------------------------------------------
  2/24/99   4:37pm      283,600   Inv32cli.exe   (x86)
  2/24/99   4:38pm      296,352   Invwin32.exe   (x86)
  2/24/99   4:38pm      867,088   Inv32cli.exe   (Alpha)
  2/24/99   4:39pm      883,472   Invwin32.exe   (Alpha)

NOTE: Due to file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that contains
the above files may also contain additional files.



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, either manually force a full inventory or wait
until it is time for a full inventory to be taken.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, perform the following steps on the Systems Management
Server site server:

1. Replace the Inv32cli.exe file in the
  &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\&lt;Platform&gt;.bin
  directory with the hotfixed version.

2. Replace the Invwin32.exe file in the
  &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\&lt;Platform&gt;.bin
  directory with the hotfixed version.

3. Replace the Invwin32.exe file in the
  &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Site.srv\&lt;Platform&gt;.bin directory with the hotfixed
  version.

4. Maintenance Manager will replicate the updated files to the Systems
  Management Server logon servers on its next work cycle. To update the
  clients, either manually run Upgrade.bat on each client or follow the
  instructions in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q166771 SMS: How to Force Site-Wide Client Updates

5. A site reset is required for Invwin32.exe (SMS_INVENTORY_AGENT_NT) to be
  copied to all servers managed by the Site Configuration Manager.
