-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain conditions, it may be possible for the Microsoft Exchange
Connector for Novell GroupWise version 2522.0 to delete users in the GroupWise
system.

CAUSE
=====

The directory synchronization process between Exchange Server and GroupWise is
composed of two pairs of transactions. The order in which these transactions are
processed is critical. If the transactions are somehow mixed, it is possible for
the version 2522.0 GroupWise Connector to delete all users in GroupWise. If
GroupWise returns the transactions in a different order than what is expected by
the connector, the version 2522.0 connector can send delete transactions into
GroupWise for GroupWise accounts. The current shipping GroupWise Connector,
version 2580.0, does not have this problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has released an updated GroupWise connector (version 2580.0). Please
ensure that you have implemented this version. The Exchange Connector for Novell
GroupWise released with Exchange 5.5 SP3 CD provides complete messaging and
calendar interoperability between Exchange Server and Novell GroupWise. It is
located in the &lt;Drive&gt;:\Exchconn\Setup\&lt;Platform&gt;\Gwxconn folder,
where &lt;Platform&gt; is the computer on which you are installing the Connector
for Novell GroupWise.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has fixed the problem. A new location for downloading the Web 3
GroupWise connector is available at:

  http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/downloads/55/GWConnector.asp

MORE INFORMATION
================

The cc:Mail, Microsoft Mail, Lotus Notes, and SNADS connectors do not appear to
be affected by this problem.
