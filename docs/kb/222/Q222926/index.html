SUMMARY
=======

Public folder replication messages are system messages, and are not subject to
size restrictions by the message transfer agent, or by restrictions specified on
a particular connector (such as the X.400 Connector). If a user posts an
extremely large message to a public folder and that public folder is configured
to replicate across a LAN or WAN, then, depending on variables such as the build
of Microsoft Exchange Server used, the bandwidth, and the quality of the
connection, other mail delivery may slow down or even stop. One solution is to
limit the size of posts to the folder.

MORE INFORMATION
================

From an Exchange client, the owner of a public folder can limit the size of
posts to the public folder. The owner of the public folder must have "send as"
permissions for the folder. To configure permissions for a public folder, start
the Exchange Server Administrator program, click to expand the &lt;Site&gt;
object, click to expand the &lt;Server&gt; object, click to expand the Public
Information Store object, click Public Folder Resources, click
&lt;folder_name&gt;, click Properties, and then click Permissions.

The recommended steps to limit the size of posts to a public folder are outlined
below, but you can modify the procedure as needed.

1. Right-click the public folder, and then click Properties.

2. Click the Administration tab, and then click Folder Assistant.

3. Click Add Rule, and then click Advanced.

4. Under "In Size (kilobytes)" enter "5,000" (without the quotation marks) (for
  this example), and then click OK.

5. Click Delete, and then click "Reply with (compose and save a template)".
  Compose a template reply; for this example, type:

  "This message is too large to post to this folder." (without the quotation
  marks)

6. To leave the Edit Rule window, click OK. To leave the Folder Assistant
  window, click OK, and then to leave the &lt;folder_name&gt; Properties
  window, click OK again.

Public folder replication message size limits are NOT affected by the replication
message size limit value, which specifies that individual replication messages
smaller than the specified size should be "batched" in to a single message up to
the specified size. To set this value, start the Exchange Server Administrator
program, click to expand the &lt;Site&gt; object, click to expand the
Configuration object, click to expand the Servers object, click to expand the
&lt;Server&gt; object, click to expand the Public Information Store object,
click Properties, and then click the Advanced tab. For additional information
about the replication message size limit value, please see the following
articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Function

  Q190737 XADM: Message Size Limits Do Not Affect Public Folder Replication
