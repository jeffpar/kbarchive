-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0SP3, 4.0, 4.0SP1, 4.0SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When an APPC or CPIC application initially allocates a conversation over an
LU6.2 session (where the remote system supports persistent verification, or
"PV"), SNA Server stores the user ID in an internal PV signed-on list, sets the
"PV sign-on requested" bit, and sends the user ID and password in the FMH-5
Attach request to the host. When the same user attempts to allocate further
conversations over the PV-enabled session, SNA Server sets the PV "already
signed on" bit and the user ID in the FMH-5 Attach. But, SNA Server never
verifies if the user password provided in subsequent conversation attempts
matches the initial user password.

See the "More Information" section below for a description of SNA Server behavior
when the update is applied.

CAUSE
=====

The IBM Persistent Verification specification appears to assume that the
password provided on subsequent conversation requests for a given user is the
same as the initial password provided by the user.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 4.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
4.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack


SNA Server 3.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
3.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q184307 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 3.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1
and 4.0 SP2. This problem was first corrected in SNA Server version 3.0 Service
Pack 4 and SNA Server version 4.0 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

With this update applied, SNA Server now caches the initial password provided by
the user when the PV sign-on request occurs. On subsequent conversation requests
from the same user, SNA Server verifies that the password matches the initially
supplied password. If the passwords don't match, SNA Server no longer passes the
user's conversation request over a PV-enabled session. Instead, SNA Server
passes the user ID and password to the host for validation. In other words, if
SNA Server suspects that an invalid password was provided, SNA Server does not
indicate the use of persistent verification, and forces the host to reverify the
request. When this occurs, SNA Server logs the following event to the Windows NT
application event log:

  Event ID: 63
  Source: SNA Server
  Description: Incorrect password received from client for logged on user

  EXPLANATION
  An invalid password was specified for a signed-on PV user (user ID: user).

  This password will be forwarded to the host to verify. If the password has
  changed, then the host wil accept the new password, and the conversation will
  continue without persistent verification.
  ACTION
  If host rejects password, then check password, and try again.

If this event occurs, the user still exists in the SNA Server PV signed-on list
with the initially supplied password. If the user supplies a password that
matches the initially supplied password, then the PV-enabled session is used.
However, if the same user supplies a different password, SNA Server sends the
user ID and password to the host but does not use PV.

Note that a user is only removed from the SNA Server PV signed-on list if:

- The remote system sends a Sign-Off GDS request to SNA Server.

-or-

- The LU-LU session limits drop to zero.
