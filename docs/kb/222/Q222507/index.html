-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Some hotfixes may place an incorrect service pack version number in the
registry. The service pack version number is normally stored in the following
REG_SZ value:

  HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\CSDVersion

The CSDVersion value typically has a data value of "Service Pack X," where X is
the service pack version number. Some post-SP3 hotfixes may replace this with a
string such as "Service Pack 3 RC 1.32" or post-SP4 hotfixes may replace this
with a string such as "Service Pack 4 RC 1.2."

Reinstallation of the same level of the service pack may not resolve the problem.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if a hotfix is built without setting the appropriate
compiler directives to embed the correct version number in the resulting binary
file. Because Ntoskrnl populates the CSDVersion value during boot with this
embedded information, the incorrect value is displayed.

The presence of the incorrect version string does not mean that the service pack
is installed improperly, or that a component has been replaced with an earlier
version.

To verify that the hotfixed component is in place, check the last modified date
and time of the fixed component in your installation with the last modified date
and time of the same file in the last service pack applied, or of the same file
in the hotfix installation folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:
