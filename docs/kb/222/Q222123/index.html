-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article provides tips for debugging OLE DB Providers which are called from
SQL Server version 7.0. Moreover, SQL Server 7.0 can perform distributed queries
by using the OPENROWSET and OPENQUERY Transact SQL functions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Specify that the OLE DB Provider is to be Loaded in the SQL Server Process Space.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default, an OLE DB Provider is invoked by SQL Server as an out-of-process
component. This is done by using proxy/stub code in Msdaps.dll which is provided
with the OLE DB core components. The OLE DB provider is hosted by using
Dllhost.exe and is the surrogate process for the OLE DB Provider. Because it is
difficult to attach to the Dllhost.exe process with the Visual C++ debugger, it
is recommended that you mark the provider as in-process for debugging purposes.
You can then attach the debugger to the SQL Server process Sqlservr.exe.
To mark a provider as in-process, use one of the following two processes:

1. Create a linked server in SQL Server 7.0 which specifies the provider. In the
  SQL Enterprise Manager, click Properties for the new linked server, choose
  Options, and then select Allow InProcess.

2. Add the provider ProgID to a key in the register at:
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSSQLServer\Providers and add a DWORD
  value under that key which is AllowInProcess with a value of 1.

NOTE: Once you have marked the provider as in-process, you can then attach to SQL
Server and more easily debug the provider.

Attach the Debugger to the SQL Server Process
---------------------------------------------

This can be done by going to Build. Click Start. Select Debug and click Attach to
Process in the Visual C++ development environment. When the process list
displays, select Show System Processes and you should see SQLSERVR appear in the
list. This is the SQL Server process. Select it and the debugger will attach to
the process. Go to Project then click Settings and select the Debug tab and add
your OLE DB Provider DLL to the list of additional DLLs. This causes the debug
information for your DLL to be loaded so breakpoints can be set in your OLE DB
Provider source code.

Debugging Providers which are Invoked Out-of-Process
----------------------------------------------------

Occasionally, a problem will occur only when an OLE DB Provider is invoked
out-of-process. By default, SQL server invokes OLE DB Providers out-of-process.
This can be changed by using the steps described earlier in this article.
However, if you must debug a problem which only occurs when the provider is
out-of-process, you need to have a way to attach the debugger to the component.
Following are a couple of ways to accomplish this:

1. Put a Sleep() in the constructor of the datasource object of the provider so
  that you have time to attach the debugger to the Dllhost.exe process which is
  the surrogate for the provider.

2. Add code to the provider so the debugger will attach automatically. Insert
  the following code into the FinalConstruct() for the datasource object:

  HRESULT FinalConstruct()
  {
     if (!IsDebuggerPresent())
     {
       char szDebuggerCmd[100];
       wsprintf(szDebuggerCmd, "C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\Common\\MSDev98\\Bin\\MSDEV -p %ld", (long)GetCurrentProcessId());
       PROCESS_INFORMATION pi;
       STARTUPINFO si;
       ZeroMemory(&amp;si, sizeof(si));
       si.cb = sizeof(si);
       si.lpDesktop = "Winsta0\\Default";

       CreateProcess(NULL, szDebuggerCmd, NULL, NULL, TRUE, 0, NULL, NULL,  &amp;si, &amp;pi); 
       Sleep(5000);
       _asm int 3
     }

     return FInit();
  }

Enable OLE DB Tracing in Query Analyzer
---------------------------------------

You can have OLE DB trace information returned in Query Analyzer by typing the
command: DBCC traceon(7300). After executing a distributed query, if the
provider returned an error, diagnostic information will be displayed in the
results window.

Enable OLE DB Tracing in SQL Server Profiler
--------------------------------------------

The SQL Server Profiler application also provides diagnostic traces for OLE DB
calls. To get information about OLE DB errors and warnings, do the following:

1. Start the SQL Server 7.0 Profiler application.

2. Go to Tools and click Options. Click the General tab and select All event
  classes.

3. Open a trace file by going to File and click New or go to File and click
  Open, and then go to File and click Properties.

4. A dialog entitled Trace Properties will be displayed. Click the Events tab.

5. Select Error and Warning events and select the OLEDB errors event.

If your OLE DB provider returns an error to SQL Server, the trace displays the
OLE DB call that failed and the return value.
