-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to open a 16-bit Microsoft Exchange Electronic Forms Designer
(EFD) form with Microsoft Outlook 97 running inside a Terminal Server client
window, you may receive the following error message:

  The form you have selected could not be displayed. The form required to view
  this message cannot be displayed. Contact your administrator.

If you receive this error message, one or both of the following events are
written to the Terminal Server computer's system event log:

   - Event ID: 10000 Source: DCOM Type: Error
  Description: Unable to start a DCOM Server:
  {B6EC1632-E61D-11D2-85EA-0000F87A5571}. The error: "Unable to perform a
  security operation on an object which has no associated security. "

- Event ID: 10010 Source: DCOM Type: Error
  Description: The server {B6EC1632-E61D-11D2-85EA-0000F87A5571} did not
  register with DCOM within the required timeout.

If you run Outlook 97 on the console of the Terminal Server computer, you can
open the same 16-bit form without the error message being displayed.

CAUSE
=====

In some situations, when the first 16-bit program to be run in the current
user's logon session is invoked using COM, the system may create a new or
additional Windows NT Virtual DOS Machine (NTVDM) that runs in the local
system's security context, instead of in the security context of the logged-on
user. Local system does not have the required permissions to load the form, and
the error message is displayed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Microsoft Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

Ensure that the Wowexec tool (Wowexec.exe) is running in the context of the
logged-on user before you attempt to load a 16-bit form, using either of the
following methods:

- Click Start, click Run, type "wowexec.exe" (without the quotation marks), and
  then click OK.

- Run Wowexec.exe from the user's logon script.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0,
Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Microsoft Windows
NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.
