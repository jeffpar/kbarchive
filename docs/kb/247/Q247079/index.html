-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.0 SP1, 5.0 SP2, 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Exchange Server 5.0 and 5.5 public folders can only be created from the
client program. The client displays the Public Folders tree that is on the
server as All Public Folders. When a you create a public folder from a client,
the client assigns default permissions to the folder, and these permissions are
inherited only by the sub-folders that are created under that folder. If a
number of public folders have already been created under the All Public Folders
hierarchy, there is no way to change permissions on all of these folders at
once.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. However, when a public folder is created under the
All Public Folders hierarchy and has one or more sub-folders created under it,
you can use the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program to change the
permissions (and other properties) on the top-level folder and simultaneously
propagate these changes to all of its sub-folders.

WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid problems with not being able to propagate permissions to sub-folders,
the following method is recommended for creating public folders when deploying
Exchange Server:

1. In the client, create a top-level folder (for example, Toplevel) under the
  All Public Folders hierarchy.

2. In the client, create one or more sub-folders (for example, Sub1 and Sub2)
  under this top-level folder.

3. In the Administrator program, click the Toplevel folder. On the File menu,
  click Properties, and then click Client Permissions.

4. Make any changes to permissions, and so on, to this folder.

5. Click "Propagate these properties to all folders".

6. Click Apply.

7. Ensure that the Permissions check box is selected, and click OK twice to quit
  the Administrator program.
