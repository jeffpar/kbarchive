SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the Real-World Weather feature in Microsoft Flight
Simulator.

NOTE: To use the Real-World Weather feature in Flight Simulator, you must connect
to the Internet.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Real-World Weather feature in Flight Simulator downloads a snapshot of
current weather data for the entire world, and uses this snapshot to configure
the weather conditions in Flight Simulator automatically.

To use the Real-World Weather feature in Flight Simulator:

1. Connect to the Internet, and then start Flight Simulator.

2. On the World menu, click Weather.

3. Click "Real-world weather" to download current weather data.

4. When the download is finished, click the green CHECK MARK.

When you download weather data from the Web, Flight Simulator uses the data to
configure local weather conditions in the game. Weather conditions in Flight
Simulator remain unchanged until you use the Real-World Weather feature to
request an update. The weather data on the source Web site is updated hourly.

Flight Simulator attempts to interpolate weather data between adjacent weather
stations to create smooth weather transitions. However, weather transitions
between stations can sometimes be abrupt. If conditions at adjacent weather
stations differ significantly, you may notice an abrupt weather transition. In
most cases, Flight Simulator 2000 is able to make smooth weather transitions
between stations.
