SYMPTOMS
========

When you open an SDLC connection with an Attachmate Advanced ISCA PCI adapter,
the connection may stay pending, and the Application event log may record the
following error message:

  Unable to Contact First Required Interrupt.

This problem occurs on some systems with a BIOS that assigns PCI interrupts to
PCI adapters outside the ISA range of interrupt 1 through 15. This has been
reported in the Compaq 3500 series.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, set the IRQ table to mapped IRQs. The following is an
example of how to do this on a Compaq 3500:

1. Ensure the adapter is installed in BUS 0. To determine if the adapter is in
  BUS 0, locate the processor. The first 4 slots located closest to the
  processor are usually the first bus, BUS 0. The PCI specification calls out 4
  bus loads (single adapters).

2. Press the F10 key during startup to access the BIOS.

3. Use the CTRL-A key combination to open the Advanced Features menu.

4. Choose Review the Hardware Settings.

5. In the View and Edit Details section, select the Full Table and Mapped
  option. This forces PCI devices to use IRQs 2 through 15.
