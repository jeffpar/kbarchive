-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a network problem causes an SNA Server DLC 802.2 connection to fail (causing
event ID 23 to be logged by SNA Server), the connection should automatically
recover to an "Active" state after the problems are gone. However, under certain
conditions, the connection may not recover, and the status may stay at "Pending"
when you use one of the following token ring adapters:

   - IBM 16/4 Token-Ring PCI Adapter 2

- IBM 16/4 Token-Ring PCI Adapter

- Compaq Netelligent Token-Ring Adapter

- Compaq Netflex Token-Ring Adapter

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by the IBM token ring driver Ibmtrp.sys, dated 11/4/96
(version 1.08). This problem is described on the IBM Web site; for information,
go to the following location:

  http://app-01.www.ibm.com/support/support_doc/nhd/s0002/body/13554.shtml

The Ibmtrp.sys driver is used for the following network adapters:

   - IBM 16/4 Token-Ring PCI Adapter 2

- IBM 16/4 Token-Ring PCI Adapter

- Compaq Netelligent Token-Ring Adapter

Microsoft is not aware of a fix for the Compaq Netflex Token-Ring Adapter, which
uses a different driver.

Note that Microsoft is not able to confirm that a switch is failing when this
problem occurs. The DLC connections drop (indicated by the SNA Server Event 23
Outage xAF errors), and at the time of the failures, network errors are
occurring (Token Ring soft errors). Updating the driver allows the connections
to recover after an outage.

RESOLUTION
==========

Update the token ring driver (Ibmtrp.sys) to version 2.22, dated 7/21/97 or
later.

STATUS
======

The third-party products discussed in this article are manufactured by vendors
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding

The third-party contact information included in this article is provided to help
you find the technical support you need. This contact information is subject to

third-party contact information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The outage that initiated the problem is logged in the Application event log as
event ID 23 with an outage code of 0xAF. This event is almost always an
indicator of a network problem.

The token ring re-insertion problem is not specific to DLC connectivity. In a lab
environment, the problem was recreated with the PING utility over IP.
