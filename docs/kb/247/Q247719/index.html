SYMPTOMS
========

If your Windows NT 4.0-based computer is configured to use the Windows Load
Balancing Service (WLBS) and experiences network communications problems,
multiple, duplicate messages may be written to the computer's event log. If you
have auditing enabled, the event log may become filled with these messages and a
new event may not be logged, even if it is from a critical service. If the event
log fills to its configured capacity, the computer may stop responding (hang).
