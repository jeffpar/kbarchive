The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

This article lists the article numbers for Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5
Connector for Lotus cc:Mail bugs that have been fixed since Exchange Server 5.5
Service Pack 3 was released. For information about how to obtain the fixes
listed in this article, click the article number next to the title of the
article about that issue to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.

NOTE: Exchange Server fixes for a particular component are cumulative and contain
all of the previous fixes for that component. Fixes with a particular version
number contain all of the fixes that have an earlier version number.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Connector for cc:Mail fixes include the following files:

+-----------------------------+
| File name | Current version |

| Ccmc.exe  | 5.5.2651.80     | 
+-----------------------------+

NOTE: The fix documented in Q249111, "XFOR: Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail
Not Supporting Korean Language," requires an updated Admin.exe file in addition
to the updated Ccmc.exe file. This updated Admin.exe file is contained in new
versions of the Administrator program, not the Exchange Connector for Lotus
