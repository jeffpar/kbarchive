SYMPTOMS
========

When accessing an FTP site whose Home Directory connects to a remote share using
a UNC path with the "Connect As" feature, one of the following symptoms might
occur:

- The Access Control List (ACL) permissions of the user account logged onto the
  FTP session are not used to determine the access permissions for the Home
  Directory.

- The following error occurs:

  Access Denied

CAUSE
=====

This is by design. The Home Directory uses the credentials of the user account
and password specified in the "Connect As" feature to connect to the UNC. All
access permissions to the Home Directory are determined by the ACLs for that
"Connect As" user account.

Therefore, the credentials (and associated permissions) for the user account that
was used to log onto the FTP site are not used to determine access to the UNC
Home Directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

To avoid these problems, do one of the following, depending on your situation:

- Do not use the UNC and "Connect As" feature for the Home Directory. Instead,
  specify a Home Directory on the local computer.

- Specify a user account for the "Connect As" feature that has the appropriate
  ACL permissions needed by the FTP site users.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The settings for the UNC and "Connect As" option are specified in the Home
Directory tab of the FTP site's property sheet in the MMC. The user account
specified in the "Connect As" option must be a local user account on both the
FTP site computer as well as the UNC file server computer, or must be a domain
user account.
