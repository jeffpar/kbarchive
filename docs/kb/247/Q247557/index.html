SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows Scripting Host (WSH) and Active Directory Services Interface
(ADSI) in Windows 2000 Server offer administrators new functionality through
scripting that was not possible previously. This article illustrates how these
two technologies can be used together to administer Internet Information
Services (IIS) 5.0.

Restarting Windows 2000 Services Using ADSI:

The following WSH code illustrates a generic example of how to use ADSI to start
a service when it is stopped.

1. Save the following code as "Startsvc.vbs" in the root of your C: drive:

  ' define a constant for stopped services
  Const ADS_SERVICE_STOPPED = 1

  ' get an ADSI object for a computer
  Set objComputer = GetObject("WinNT://MYCOMPUTER,computer")

  ' get an object for a service
  Set objService  = objComputer.GetObject("Service","MYSERVICE")

  ' check to see if the service is stopped
  If (objService.Status = ADS_SERVICE_STOPPED) Then

    ' if the service is stopped, then start it
    objService.Start

  End If

2. Run the code by using the following command:

  "CSCRIPT C:\STARTSVC.VBS" (without the quotation marks)

NOTES:

- You must replace MYCOMPUTER and MYSERVICE with a valid computer and service
  name for the previous script to work. Use the short version of the service
  name (for example, for the World Wide Web Publishing Service, use W3SVC).

- CScript.exe is located in the %SystemRoot%\system32 directory, but should be
  in the PATH.

Restarting IIS Using ADSI:

The following WSH code is a more elaborate example of WSH and ADSI working
together to restart all of the IIS services.

1. Save the following code as "Restsvc.vbs" in the root of your C: drive:

  Option Explicit

  ' define ADSI status constants
  Const ADS_SERVICE_STOPPED          = 1
  Const ADS_SERVICE_START_PENDING    = 2
  Const ADS_SERVICE_STOP_PENDING     = 3
  Const ADS_SERVICE_RUNNING          = 4
  Const ADS_SERVICE_CONTINUE_PENDING = 5
  Const ADS_SERVICE_PAUSE_PENDING    = 6
  Const ADS_SERVICE_PAUSED           = 7
  Const ADS_SERVICE_ERROR            = 8

  ' define string constants for service methods
  Const START_SERVICE    = "START"
  Const STOP_SERVICE     = "STOP"
  Const PAUSE_SERVICE    = "PAUSE"
  Const CONTINUE_SERVICE = "CONTINUE"

  ' declare global variables
  Dim objWsh
  Dim objEnv
  Dim strComputerName

  ' get the environment variable with the computer name
  Set objWsh = WScript.CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
  Set objEnv = objWsh.Environment("PROCESS")
  strComputerName = objEnv("COMPUTERNAME")

  ' call CycleService() to stop all the services
  CycleService strComputerName,"MSFTPSVC",STOP_SERVICE,True
  CycleService strComputerName,"SMTPSVC" ,STOP_SERVICE,True
  CycleService strComputerName,"NNTPSVC" ,STOP_SERVICE,True
  CycleService strComputerName,"W3SVC"   ,STOP_SERVICE,True
  CycleService strComputerName,"IISADMIN",STOP_SERVICE,True

  ' call CycleService() to start all the services
  CycleService strComputerName,"IISADMIN",START_SERVICE,True
  CycleService strComputerName,"W3SVC"   ,START_SERVICE,True
  CycleService strComputerName,"NNTPSVC" ,START_SERVICE,True
  CycleService strComputerName,"SMTPSVC" ,START_SERVICE,True
  CycleService strComputerName,"MSFTPSVC",START_SERVICE,True

  ' ****************************************
  ' CycleService() subroutine
  ' this subroutine is passed four variables:
  '   1. strComputer  = the name of the computer
  '   2. strService   = the name of the service (e.g. w3svc, smtpsvc, etc.)
  '   3. strOperation = the operation to be completed (e.g. start, stop)
  '   4. boolTrace    = True will output trace information, False will not
  ' ****************************************
  Sub CycleService(strComputer,strService,strOperation,boolTrace)
    On Error Resume Next

    ' declare variables
    Dim objComputer
    Dim objService
    Dim strTrace
    Dim boolSuccess

    ' get ADSI objects and initial variables
    Set objComputer = GetObject("WinNT://" &amp; strComputer &amp; ",computer")
    Set objService  = objComputer.GetObject("Service",strService)
    strTrace = strOperation &amp; " " &amp; strService &amp; " on " &amp; strComputer
    boolSuccess = False

    ' output trace information if needed
    If boolTrace Then Trace "Attempting to " &amp; strTrace &amp; "..."

    ' determine the operation and carry it out
    Select Case (strOperation)
      Case START_SERVICE      
        If (objService.Status = ADS_SERVICE_STOPPED) Then
          objService.Start
          If Err.Number&lt;&gt;0 Then ErrorHandler strTrace
          While objService.Status &lt;&gt; ADS_SERVICE_RUNNING: Wend
          boolSuccess = True
        End If
      Case STOP_SERVICE
        If (objService.Status = ADS_SERVICE_RUNNING) Or (objService.Status = ADS_SERVICE_PAUSED) Then
          objService.Stop
          If Err.Number&lt;&gt;0 Then ErrorHandler strTrace
          While objService.Status &lt;&gt; ADS_SERVICE_STOPPED: Wend
          boolSuccess = True
        End If
      Case PAUSE_SERVICE
        If (objService.Status = ADS_SERVICE_RUNNING) Then
          objService.Pause
          If Err.Number&lt;&gt;0 Then ErrorHandler strTrace
          While objService.Status &lt;&gt; ADS_SERVICE_PAUSED: Wend
          boolSuccess = True
        End If
      Case CONTINUE_SERVICE
        If (objService.Status = ADS_SERVICE_PAUSED) Then
          objService.Continue
          If Err.Number&lt;&gt;0 Then ErrorHandler strTrace
          While objService.Status &lt;&gt; ADS_SERVICE_RUNNING: Wend
          boolSuccess = True
        End If
    End Select

    ' output trace information if needed
    If boolTrace And boolSuccess Then Trace strTrace &amp; " was successful."

  End Sub

  ' ****************************************
  ' Trace() subroutine
  ' outputs time and trace information
  ' ****************************************
  Sub Trace(strText)
    WScript.Echo Now &amp; " : " &amp; strText
  End Sub

  ' ****************************************
  ' ErrorHandler() subroutine
  ' outputs error status and exits
  ' ****************************************
  Sub ErrorHandler(strText)

    Dim strError
    strError = Now &amp; " : The following error occurred trying to " &amp; strText &amp; vbCrLf
    strError = strError &amp; vbCrLf &amp; "0x" &amp; Hex(Err.Number) &amp; " - " &amp; Err.Description
    WScript.Echo strError
    WScript.Quit

  End Sub

2. Run the code with the following command:

  "CSCRIPT C:\RESTSVC.VBS" (without the quotation marks)

  When you use the CycleService function, only stop the services that are
  installed on the computer. You will receive an "object required" error
  message when you try to stop or start a service that is not installed on the
  computer.

3. Stop the services first that depend on the service you are trying to stop.
  For example, you must stop W3SVC, MSFTPSVC and SMTPSVC first before you stop
  IISADMIN.

4. When you execute the code, the output should be similar to the following:

  12/31/1999 12:00:00 PM : Attempting to STOP MSFTPSVC on MYCOMPUTER...
  12/31/1999 12:00:00 PM : STOP MSFTPSVC on MYCOMPUTER was successful.
  12/31/1999 12:00:00 PM : Attempting to STOP SMTPSVC on MYCOMPUTER...
  12/31/1999 12:00:01 PM : STOP SMTPSVC on MYCOMPUTER was successful.
  12/31/1999 12:00:01 PM : Attempting to STOP W3SVC on MYCOMPUTER...
  12/31/1999 12:00:02 PM : STOP W3SVC on MYCOMPUTER was successful.
  etc.
