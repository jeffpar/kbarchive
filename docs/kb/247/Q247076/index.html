-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In Exchange Server 5.5 (including Service Packs 1, 2, and 3), you can neither
delete the Internet Newsgroups public folder nor hide it from the Address Book
so that it is not visible from the client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you install any of the versions of Exchange Server listed in the "Applies
to" banner, a folder called Internet Newsgroups is created by default under the
Public Folder hierarchy. This folder is used by the Internet News Service to
download messages from the various news servers on the Internet. Any user who
logs on to Exchange Server sees this folder under the Public Folders\All Public
Folders hierarchy. When this folder is created during installation of Exchange
Server, the Hide From Address Book attribute is set to "0," which means it is
not hidden and, therefore, is visible. This attribute cannot be edited. However,
you can view the attribute if you start the Exchange Server Administrator
program in raw mode.

WARNING: Using the raw mode of the Exchange Server Administrator program (admin
/r) incorrectly can cause serious problems that may require you to reinstall
Microsoft Windows NT Server and/or Microsoft Exchange Server. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of raw mode can be
solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.

1. Start the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program in raw mode by
  typing the following at a command prompt:

  "c:\exchsrvr\bin\admin /r" (without the quotation marks)

2. Double-click the Folders object.

3. Double-click the Public Folders object.

4. Double-click the Internet Newsgroups folder.

5. On the File menu, click Raw Properties (or press SHIFT+ENTER from the
  keyboard).

NOTE: In Exchange Server 5.0, you can hide this folder from the client because
the Hide from Address Book attribute is editable. For additional information,
