The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The AddSystem and Addsytemgui utilities in the Systems Management Server (SMS)
Resource Kit have the following problems:

1. They are hard coded to create a DDR with the sitecode set to BER.

2. They do not set and key properties on DDRAddxxx functions. Because of this,
  if Addsytem is run again on the same computer, a duplicate resource is
  created under SMS. Note that DDM has no way of checking if the resource
  already exists.

3. Addsytem sets some wrong properties in the DDR and misses some required ones.

4. Operating System Name and Version property is hard coded to Microsoft Windows
  NT Advanced Server 4.0. This should be set dependent on the operating system
  installed (Windows NT Workstation 4.0, Windows NT Server 4.0, Windows NT
  Advanced Server 4.0). This would permit the remote installation service to
  act on operating system type if the administrator has set specific types to
  be installed, such as workstations only, servers only, and so on.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Systems Management Server service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.
