The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Intrasite replication does not work for the site naming context, and the Event
Viewer application log displays the following event ID:

  Event ID: 1171
  Source: MSExchangeDS
  Type: Error
  Category: Internal Processing
  Description:
  Exception e0010004 has occurred with parameters -1069 and 0 (internal ID
  2080113). Contact Microsoft Technical Support for assistance.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs when a replication message is received that requires a very
large number of changes on a single object in the directory, as is typically
seen with distribution lists (DLs) that contain more than 5,000 members. For
replication changes to finish successfully, all the members in the DL must be
loaded into the Exchange Server computer's version store. If the version store
is not adequate, event 1171 is logged and replication doesn't work.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, limit the size of your distribution lists. Larger DLs can
be achieved by nesting DLs together, rather than creating very large DLs.

WORKAROUND

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before
you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you
understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information
about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following
article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this issue:

1. Start Registry Editor.

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeDS\Parameters

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

  Value Name: EDB max ver pages (increment over the minimum)
  Data Type: REG_DWORD
  Radix: Decimal
  Value: 2000

NOTE: You need to enter all the above text after "Value Name:", including the
text in parentheses, exactly as it appears above.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

5. Re-start the Exchange Directory Service for these changes to take effect.

NOTE: If the value of 2,000 (default 1,000) is not adequate, increase this value
in increments of 1,000. This value represents 16-kilobyte (KB) pages, so 2,000 X
16 KB of memory is allocated for the version store. It is important to not set
this value too high as you deplete the memory resources on your Exchange Server
computer and potentially hinder its performance.

This setting must be added to all Exchange Server computers in the organization
that are receiving the events described in the "Symptoms" section.


STATUS
======

This behavior is by product design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you run the Error.exe utility from the Exchange Server CD, it produces the
following output:

  Error -1069 (0xfffffbd3) JET_errVersionStoreOutOfMemory

To determine the object that is causing the error, you need to do the following:

1. Increase diagnostics logging on MSExchangeDS, set Replication to maximum and
  Internal Processing to minimum.

2. Allow replication to take place, and observe the 1171 events.

3. Locate the 1171 error, and then scroll through the subsequent entries in the
  Event Viewer for the following event:

  Event ID: 1083
  Source: MSExchangeDS
  Type: Warning
  Category: Replication
  Description:
  Replication warning: The directory replication agent (DRA) couldn't
  synchronize naming context /o=&lt;ORG&gt;/ou=&lt;SiteName&gt; with naming
  context on directory &lt;SourceServerName&gt;.

  This event defines the server in the &lt;SourceServerName&gt; that is sending
  the replication updates that are causing the errors.

4. Search events previous to the 1083 event for the following event:

  Event ID: 1082
  Source: MSExchangeDS
  Type: Information
  Category: Replication
  Description:
  Replication warning: The directory replication agent (DRA) couldn't update
  object
  /o=&lt;ORG&gt;/ou=&lt;SiteName&gt;/cn=Recipients/cn=&lt;OptionalContainers...&gt;/cn=&lt;ProblemDL&gt;
  with changes made by directory &lt;SourceServerName&gt; because error 22. The
  directory tries to update the object later. If this condition persists, try
  to free more disk space or stop and restart this Microsoft Exchange Server
  computer.

  This event defines the distribution list that is causing the replication
  issues. As recommended, this distribution list needs to be re-architected to
  contain fewer entries, approximately 5,000 members for each list.
