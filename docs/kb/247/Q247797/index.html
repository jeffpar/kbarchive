-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT 4.0 generates an LBN_SELCHANGE notification for drop-down list boxes
in the following circumstances:

1. The user clicks the arrow on the right side of the drop-down list box to drop
  the list down.

2. The user moves the mouse pointer down the list causing various items in the
  list to be selected, but does not click any item.

3. The user moves the mouse pointer outside the list box, and then clicks the
  mouse to close the drop-down list.

At this point, a sequence of windows messages are sent to the program. Under
Windows NT 4.0, this includes an extraneous LBN_SELCHANGE notification for the
list box. It is incorrect to send an LBN_SELCHANGE notification at this point
because clicking outside of a dropped-down list box to close it as described
above does not change the current selection in the list box.

Microsoft Visual Basic programs may see this as an extra Click event if a Click
method is defined for the list box.

Some programs that run without problems under Windows NT 3.51 may malfunction
when they receive this unexpected notification under Windows NT 4.0.
