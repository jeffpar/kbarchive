The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes some basic troubleshooting steps for users that do not
have previous experience with Microsoft Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS)
and Microsoft Proxy Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

These troubleshooting steps can help you if you are having problems getting Dial
on Demand (DOD) to work over RRAS with Proxy Server on the same computer, and
can assist you in finding most major problems (or at least help in ruling out
the most common causes).

To verify basic connectivity, you can check the following items for RRAS issues.

Internet Protocol (IP) Forwarding
---------------------------------

To verify that IP forwarding is enabled on both RRAS servers:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
  Network.

2. Click Protocols, click Properties, and then click Routing.

3. Make sure that the Enable IP Forwarding check box is selected.

4. Click OK, and then click Close.

5. Restart the computer.

Routing
-------

You only need to have one default gateway on the computer that is connected to
the Internet. On each of your wide area network (WAN) interfaces, only two
routes are required. To check this configuration:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click
  Routing and RAS Admin.

2. Double-click IP Routing, right-click Static Routes, and then click View IP
  routing table.

3. Verify that your default gateway is set for the interface connecting to the
  Internet. If this route is not listed in the IP routing table dialog box, add
  the route using the following steps:

  a. Right-click Static Routes, and then click Add Static Route.

  b. Type the appropriate values for your default gateway in the Destination,
     Network Mask, and Gateway boxes.

  c. Select the interface for your network card that is connected to the
     Internet, and then click OK.

4. Verify that a route exists in the IP routing table dialog box with a path to
  the other network segment that you want to communicate with the Internet. If
  this route does not exist, add the route using the following steps:

  a. Right-click Static Routes, and the click Add Static Route.

  b. Type the appropriate values for the network segment in the Destination,
     Network Mask, and Gateway boxes.

  c. Select the interface for your network card that is connected to the
     network segment (this may include multiple DOD virtual private networking
     connections), and then click OK.

NOTE: You need to delete any other routes that exist.

Credentials
-----------

To set up an easy-to-understand configuration for your virtual private networking
(VPN) DOD interface on both RRAS servers, create duplicate users with the same
name in User Manager for Domains for the interface on both WAN segments. When
each side connects, make sure it is authenticating with the correct credentials
(using the correct domain if the interface has the same name). If this does not
work, you can create a new VPN dial-up connection. For example, on segment A,
name your user and DOD interface "DOD," and on segment B, name the user and DOD
interface "DOD."

Proxy Server Troubleshooting
----------------------------

Access Control:

Disable access control on the Web Proxy and Winsock Proxy services if possible.
If you are having a problem with access control, verify that all Web Proxy users
have local logon permissions and make sure all Winsock proxy users are logged on
to a trusted domain.

More Access Control:

Verify the authentication methods (if any) that are enabled in the WWW service.
To do this:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, point to
  Microsoft Proxy Server, and then click Microsoft Management Console.

2. Double-click Internet Information Server, double-click the server name you
  want to check, right-click Default Web Site, and then click Properties.

3. Click Directory Security, and then click Edit to view the current
  authentication settings.

Packet Filtering:

If packet filtering is enabled, be sure to disable this function when performing
your troubleshooting tasks. If packet filtering must remain enabled, make sure
dynamic packet filtering is enabled. To disable packet filtering:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click
  Routing and RAS Admin.

2. Double-click IP Routing, click Summary, right-click the interface on which
  you want to disable packet filtering, click Configure IP parameters, and then
  click to clear the Enable packet filtering check box.

If Packet Filtering is not enabled on the Proxy server which has RRAS running,
then it should be enabled and the following two predefined filters need to be
added:

  PPTP Call
  PPTP Receive

In addition to these two filters make sure that Dynamic Packet filtering is
enabled so that none of the clients behind the Proxy server have any issues
accessing the internet through the Proxy server.

Local Address Table (LAT):

The LAT should contain all internal TCP/IP addresses; it should not contain any
external Internet addresses. If you make changes to the LAT, refresh the proxy
clients' configuration. To check the LAT:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, point to
  Microsoft Proxy Server, and then click Microsoft Management Console.

2. Right-click Web Proxy, click Properties, and then click Local Address Table.

Trusts
------

Verify that any trust using a DOD, VPN, or other dial-up connection is still
valid. If a connection is lost for more than 15 minutes, the trust may be
broken. Make sure that someone with Administrator rights at each site knows how
to re-create a broken trust. RRAS is not a recommended environment for
maintaining a trust relationship.

Browsing Over RRAS
------------------

You can check the following items when you are attempting to troubleshoot RRAS
browsing issues:

- Check the load order of the services running on the computer.
  For information about how to this, click the article number below to view the
  article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q183537 Coexistence of RRAS, Internet Explorer, Option Pack, and Proxy

- Verify the entries in the Lmhosts file for all network segments and add #DOM
  entries for both sides of the WAN.

  to view the articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q180094 How to Write an LMHOSTS File for Domain Validation

  Q150800 Domain Browsing with TCP/IP and LMHOSTS Files

If the problem persists after you verify the above information, use the nbtstat
-r and nbtstat -c commands to display the NetBIOS Remote Cache Name Table. The
output you receive looks similar to the following example:

  Node IpAddress: [120.120.100.1] Scope Id: []
            NetBIOS Remote Cache Name Table

  Name               Type        Host Address      Life [sec]
  -----------------------------------------------------------
  Program      &lt;00&gt;  UNIQUE      120.120.100.10      420
  Domain.com   &lt;1E&gt;  GROUP       0.0.0.0             480
  Domain.com   &lt;1B&gt;  UNIQUE      120.120.100.242     480
  Domain.com   &lt;1C&gt;  UNIQUE      120.120.120.1       -1
  Domain.com   &lt;1B&gt;  UNIQUE      120.120.120.1       -1
  Domain       &lt;03&gt;  UNIQUE      120.120.120.1       -1
  Domain       &lt;00&gt;  UNIQUE      120.120.120.1       -1
  Domain       &lt;20&gt;  UNIQUE      120.120.120.1       -1

Note the two &lt;1B&gt; type entries for the domain master browser in the cache;
one for the network interface at 120.120.120.1 and the second address for the
Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) WAN wrapper at 120.120.100.242
(the router address). The router 1b entry is incorrect. This is typical of a
multihomed primary domain controller (PDC) registering the browser service the
router TCP/IP address, as well as the internal TCP/IP address. To resolve this
issue:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, double-click Network,
  and then click Bindings.

2. In the "Show Bindings for" box, click "all protocols".

3. Double-click WINS Client(TCP/IP), click the first Remote Access WAN Wrapper
  entry, and then click Disable. Repeat this process for all Remote Access WAN
  wrapper entries.

Dial-Up Permissions
-------------------

In User Manager for Domains, verify that each RRAS DOD account has the correct
permissions on both network segments. To do this:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then click
  User Manager for Domains .

2. Double-click the account you want to verify, click Dialin, click "Grant
  dialin permission to user" (if necessary), and then click OK.
