SUMMARY
=======

Exchange Server 4.0:

Exchange Server version 4.0 Standard Edition does not come with the Internet Mail
Connector (IMC), the X.400 Connector, or the Site Connector. To install any of
these connectors you must first purchase or create the installation disks. If
you plan to perform directory replication with other Exchange Server sites, you
must install the Site Connector.

NOTE: The Select May 1996 Complete Release Burgundy CD contains the Standard
Edition. See the "More Information" section of this article.

Exchange Server 5.0:

Exchange Server version 5.0 Standard Edition does not come with the X.400
Connector or the Site Connector. To install either of these connectors you must
first purchase or create the installation disks. If you plan to perform
directory replication with other Exchange Server sites, you must install the
Site Connector. If you subscribed to Select CD, your CD may or may not have
these connectors, depending on your customer subscription. Linkage Connectors
are not included in the Exchange Server 5.0 Service Packs and are discontinued.
Updates are on the Microsoft FTP site in the following directory:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/exchange/exchange-public/fixes/eng/linkage

Exchange Server 5.5:

Exchange Server version 5.5 Standard Edition does not come with the X.400
Connector, the Exchange Connector for IBM Office Vision/VM (PROFS), the Exchange
Connector for SNADS, the Exchange Connector for Novell GroupWise, or the
Calendar Connector.

To install the X.400 Connector you must first purchase the X.400 Connector disk.
If you subscribed to Select CD, your CD may or may not have the X.400 Connector,
depending on your customer subscription.

The Exchange Connector for IBM Office Vision/VM (PROFS) and the Exchange
Connector for SNADS are not available for the Standard Edition; these connectors
require that you upgrade to Exchange Server 5.5 Enterprise Edition. Updates are

Ex55sp3yk\Eng\Exchconn\Setup\I386 folder under the Ovvconn and Snaconn
subfolders, respectively.

The Exchange Connector for Novell GroupWise and the Calendar Connector are free
on the Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3 CD in the
Ex55sp3yk\Eng\Exchconn\Setup\I386 folder under the Calcon and Gwxcon subfolders,
respectively. These connectors require that you install Service Pack 1. These
connectors can also be downloaded from the Microsoft FTP site in the following
directory:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/exchange/exchange-public/fixes/eng/exchg5.5/sp3
