MORE INFORMATION
================

MIP Mapping is a 3D rendering method used in many games, including Flight
Simulator 2000. When textured scenery in a game disappears into the distance,
MIP-mapping mixes high-detail and low-detail versions of the same texture to
make distant textures appear more natural.
