SUMMARY
=======

Web administrators may need to periodically disable the caching of content that
changes frequently. This article describes a method to disable caching of
document types.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MIME stands for "Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions," which refers to a way
of configuring browsers or mail clients to view files that are in multiple
formats based on a "MIME type." "MIME mapping" is a process by which Internet
Information Server (IIS) "maps" files by their extensions to a particular MIME
type. For example, a file with the extension .htm has a MIME type of
"text/html", whereas a file with the extension .gif has a MIME Type of
"image/gif".

When a request is made by a client for a particular file, IIS uses the MIME map
to determine the correct MIME type to tell a client it will be receiving. IIS
contains a large list of default MIME types to use and will return a MIME type
of "application/octet-stream" for any file extension that is not explicitly
mapped.

Cache Disabling Techniques:

- The easiest way to disable caching of a given MIME type is to create folders
  based on the types to disable and then set custom headers for those folders.
  For example, the following steps will disable caching of files in an images
  folder:

  1. Create a folder under your Wwwroot folder named "Images" (without the
     quotation marks).

  2. Open the Internet Services Manager (ISM).

  3. Locate the Images folder under your default Web site.

  4. Right-click the Images folder and select Properties.

  5. Select the HTTP Headers tab.

  6. Click Add in the Custom HTTP Headers section.

  7. Add a header named "Cache-Control" (without the quotation marks) with a
     value of no-cache.

  8. Click ok to apply the changes.

  When creating content, any files stored in this folder will no longer be
  cached. This is especially useful when working with images that are
  frequently updated.

- The following steps describe an unsupported method of tricking IIS using
  Windows Scripting Host (WSH) and Active Directory Service Interfaces (ADSI)
  into returning a "no-cache" header for a specific MIME type, in this case
  .gif files, for an entire Web server by modifying the IIS metabase.

  1. Save the following WSH code in your %SystemDrive%\InetPub\AdminScripts
     folder as "MimeChange.vbs" (without the quotation marks):

  Option Explicit

  Dim boolFound
  Dim intCount
  Dim intMimeMap
  Dim objMimeMap
  Dim varMimeMap
  Dim varMimeExt
  Dim varMimeTyp

  ' specify the extension and MIME type to work with
  varMimeExt = ".gif"
  ' NOTE - this entry stores an extra HTTP header with the MIME information
  ' this "tricks" IIS into sending the extra cache control header
  varMimeTyp = "image/gif" &amp; vbCrLf &amp; "Cache-Control: no-cache"

  ' create the ADSI object &amp; current MIME map at that path
  Set objMimeMap = GetObject("IIS://localhost/w3svc")
  varMimeMap = objMimeMap.GetEx("MimeMap")

  ' get the MIME map count &amp; set search status to false
  intCount = UBound(varMimeMap) + 1
  boolFound = False

  ' loop through MIME map searching for existing extension information
  For intMimeMap = 0 to intCount - 1
    If varMimeMap(intMimeMap).Extension = varMimeExt Then
      boolFound = True
      Exit For
    End If
  Next

  ' if no extension information is found, create the new mapping
  If boolFound = False Then
    intMimeMap = intCount
    ReDim Preserve varMimeMap(intMimeMap)
    Set varMimeMap(intMimeMap) = CreateObject("MimeMap")
    varMimeMap(intMimeMap).Extension = varMimeExt
  End If

  ' store the new information in the MIME map
  varMimeMap(intMimeMap).MimeType = varMimeTyp
  objMimeMap.PutEx 2,"MimeMap",varMimeMap
  objMimeMap.SetInfo

  2. Execute the following command to modify the metabase:

  "CSCRIPT %SystemDrive%\InetPub\AdminScripts\MimeChange.vbs" (without the
  quotation marks)

  Future requests for .gif files will now returned with the desired "no-cache"
  header.
