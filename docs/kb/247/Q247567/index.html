SYMPTOMS
========

When you want to install Windows NT Service Pack 4 in an unattended mode by use
of the -u and -q switches, the installation may stop when the license agreement
appears, possibly requiring operator input for the service pack installation to
proceed. The -u and -q switches can be applied to the archive for Service Pack 4
(Sp4i386.exe) or to the Service Pack 4 update program (Update.exe) produced by
expanding the archived service pack. The archive and the update program are able
to interpret and accept the available switches.

CAUSE
=====

The issue can occur when switches are used with the archive and the .exe file
extension is included. For example, if you run sp4i386.exe -u or -q, the license
agreement is presented and the installation stops.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, when you applying Service Pack 4 by archive while using
switches, do not use the .exe extension. Instead, use the following syntax,
"sp4i386 -u" (without the quotation marks) or "sp4i386 -q" (without the
quotation marks).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following are installation switches that can be used with the Sp4i386.exe
archive or the Update.exe tool. The following syntax help is available by typing
update "/?" (without the quotation marks), but only after the Update.exe tool.
Note that /? does not work when passed to the Service Pack 4 Archive:

UPDATE [-u] [-f] [-n] [-o] [-z] [-q]

- -u unattended mode

- -f forces other programs to close at shutdown

- -n do not back up files for uninstallation

- -o overwrite OEM files without prompting

- -z do not reboot when installation is complete

- -q quiet mode, no user interaction

See the Readme.txt file included in the Service Pack 4 archive or on the Service
Pack 4 CD-ROM for more information.
