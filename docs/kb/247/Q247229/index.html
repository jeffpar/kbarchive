The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When logging is enabled for a Microsoft Systems Management Server component that
is implemented as a thread of the SMS Executive service, the service must be
able to obtain write access to the log file. If the SMS Executive service cannot
open the output file to write the logging information, its performance is
severely affected.

CAUSE
=====

The component enters a loop and continuously attempts to open the file. This
behavior dramatically slows the SMS Executive service: It takes five seconds for
the loop to time out for every entry that a given component attempts to log.

WORKAROUND
==========

Ensure that the Systems Management Server service account has full access to the
directory where the Systems Management Server log files are created. By default,
this is the \Sms\Logs directory.
