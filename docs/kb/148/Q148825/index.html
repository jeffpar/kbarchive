SYMPTOMS
========


When you attempt to connect to MSN, The Microsoft Network, you may receive the
following error message:

  Modem is busy or not found.

CAUSE
=====

This message may indicate that an incorrect driver for your modem is installed,
or that another application is taking control of the modem.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use any of the following methods:

CHECK FOR SOFTWARE CONFLICT

To determine whether there is a conflict with another program:

1. Press the CTRL+ALT+DELETE key combination and highlight any program, except
  Explorer or Systray, and then click End Task.

2. Repeat this process until only Explorer and Systray, if present, are listed
  in the Close Program dialog box.

CHECK FOR INCORRECT MODEM DRIVER

To determine which modem driver is installed:

1. Go to Start, click Control Panel, and then double-click Modems.

2. If the modem listed is not the modem that is connected to your computer, then
  click the listed modem, and then click Remove.

3. Click Add to run the Install New Modem Wizard, and if automatic detection
  does not correctly identify your modem, click the Don't detect my modem, I
  will select it from a list check box to select it and then manually select
  your modem from the list.

CHECK CONNECTIONS WITH OTHER PROGRAMS

Test the modem with another 32-bit application, such as HyperTerminal:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then click
  HyperTerminal.

2. Click AT&amp;T Mail or MCI Mail. If a dialog box containing an OK button
  appears, click OK, and then click OK again.

3. Click Dial, and allow the modem to dial the number. When the screen appears
  prompting for a login name, type in a test login name.

4. If what is displayed does not correspond with the typing, or an error message
  appears before this point, contact the modem manufacturer for assistance in
  configuring their modem for 32-bit applications.

CHECK EXTRA MODEM SETTINGS

To determine the extra settings for your modem:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Modems, click your modem, and then click Properties.

3. On the Connection tab, click Advanced, and then check the value in the Extra
  Settings box. To determine the correct extra settings for your modem, please
