SUMMARY
=======

By design, MFC Regular DLLs have a default DllMain function provided
automatically by MFC. Regular DLLs should not provide their own DllMain. Any
initialization which is necessary when the DLL is loaded should be done in the
InitInstance member function of the one CWinApp-derived class in the Regular
DLL. Deinitialization and termination code should go in the ExitInstance member
function.

However, InitInstance is only called by MFC's DllMain when a process attaches
(DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH) to the DLL and ExitInstance is called only when a process
detaches (DLL_PROCESS_DETACH) from the DLL. If it is necessary to handle thread
attachment to and detachment from (DLL_THREAD_ATTACH and DLL_THREAD_DETACH) in
MFC Regular DLL, the Regular DLL will need to provide its own DllMain. This
article explains how to do it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a Regular DLL is created, the MFC source forcibly links in the code for the
source file \Msdev\Mfc\Src\Dllmodul.cpp. Dllmodul.cpp contains most of the code
added to a Regular DLL to support MFC in that DLL. One of the most important
functions in Dllmodul.cpp is the DllMain function.

To add code to MFC's DllMain, copy the \Msdev\Mfc\Src\Dllmodul.cpp source file to
your project directory, and include the copy in your project. This copy of
Dllmodul.cpp will be compiled and linked into your DLL instead of the
Dllmodul.cpp in the Mfc\Src directory, so changes to the DllMain in it will show
up in the final DLL.

The primary caveat is that this is not a recommended solution and should only be
used when absolutely necessary. Any changes to the code in Dllmodul.cpp will
undoubtedly have unpredictable results. Add code only, do not remove or modify
the existing code.

For regular DLLs that use MFC in the Shared Lib, the module state should be set
at the beginning of any added code and restored before returning from DllMain.
Refer to the sample code in this article for an example of a DllMain that
handles the DLL_THREAD_ATTACH and DLL_THREAD_DETACH notifications and properly
switches the module state as necessary.

Additional care must be taken when relying on DllMain being called with
DLL_THREAD_ATTACH and DLL_THREAD_DETACH because of the following conditions:

- When a thread is created in a process, the system calls DllMain with a value
  of DLL_THREAD_ATTACH for each of the DLLs mapped into into the process.
  However, if a process has several threads running in it when a new DLL is
  mapped into it, DllMain isn't called with a DLL_THREAD_ATTACH value for any
  of the existing threads.

- DllMain is not called with a value DLL_THREAD_ATTACH for the process's
  primary thread.

- On thread termination (by a call to ExitThread), DllMain is called with a
  value of DLL_THREAD_DETACH for each of the DLLs. DllMain is not called with
  DLL_THREAD_DETACH for any thread unless a thread terminates by calling
  ExitThread.

- If a thread terminates due to a call to TerminateThread, DllMain isn't called
  with a value DLL_THREAD_DETACH.

- It is possible for a thread in a process to call LoadLibrary to load a DLL
  causing a call to DllMain with DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, and then on thread
  termination, cause a call to dllMain with DLL_THREAD_DETACH without ever
  calling DLL_THREAD_ATTACH. It is therefore best that the thread that calls
  LoadLibrary also call FreeLibrary.

NOTE: MFC CWnd objects, CDC objects, CMenu objects, GDI objects, and CImageList
objects are restricted to a per-thread, per-module basis. In other words, MFC
objects created in one module or thread cannot be passed to and/or used in a
different module or thread. This has special relevance for any code added to
handle DLL_THREAD_ATTACH or DLL_THREAD_DETACH in DllMain because DllMain is
called for these reasons with different threads. CWnd objects, for instance,
created in DllMain during DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH or in InitInstance will not be
valid during DLL_THREAD_ATTACH.

Sample Code
-----------

  //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// 
  // export DllMain for the DLL
  // Add code in the specified sections only.
  // Remove code at your own risk.
  extern "C"
  BOOL WINAPI DllMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, DWORD dwReason, LPVOID
  /*lpReserved*/)
  {
     if (dwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH)
     {
  // ... Code abbreviated from DLLMODUL.CPP
     }
     else if (dwReason == DLL_PROCESS_DETACH)
     {
  // ... Code abbreviated from DLLMODUL.CPP
     }
  // NEW CODE ADDED HERE
  // -------------------
     else if (dwReason == DLL_THREAD_ATTACH)
     {
  #ifdef _AFXDLL
        // set module state
        ASSERT(AfxGetThreadState()-&gt;m_pPrevModuleState == NULL);
        AfxGetThreadState()-&gt;m_pPrevModuleState =
           AfxSetModuleState(AfxGetStaticModuleState());
  #endif
        // ADD DLL_THREAD_ATTACH CODE HERE
        // Remember that this won't necessarily be called for
        // every thread in the process into which this DLL is mapped
        // Threads created by the process BEFORE the DLL
        // was loaded will not call into DLL_THREAD_ATTACH.

  #ifdef _AFXDLL
        // restore previously-saved module state
       VERIFY(AfxSetModuleState(AfxGetThreadState()-&gt;m_pPrevModuleState)
               == AfxGetStaticModuleState());
          DEBUG_ONLY(AfxGetThreadState()-&gt;m_pPrevModuleState = NULL);
  #endif

     }
     else if (dwReason ==DLL_THREAD_DETACH)
     {
  #ifdef _AFXDLL
        // set module state
        ASSERT(AfxGetThreadState()-&gt;m_pPrevModuleState == NULL);
        AfxGetThreadState()-&gt;m_pPrevModuleState =
           AfxSetModuleState(AfxGetStaticModuleState());
  #endif
        // ADD DLL_THREAD_DETACH CODE HERE

  #ifdef _AFXDLL
        // restore previously-saved module state
     VERIFY(AfxSetModuleState(AfxGetThreadState()-&gt;m_pPrevModuleState)
            == AfxGetStaticModuleState());
        DEBUG_ONLY(AfxGetThreadState()-&gt;m_pPrevModuleState = NULL);
  #endif
     }

     return TRUE;
  }
