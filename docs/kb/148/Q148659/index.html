SUMMARY
=======


Windows NT Debug Symbols must be set up if a computer needs to be remotely or
locally debugged. This article provides instructions on how to set up Windows NT
Debug Symbols.

What Are Symbols
----------------

Debug Symbol files (symbols) are required to do both kernel and user-mode
debugging in Windows NT. Symbols provide a way to resolve global variables and
function names in the loaded executable file.

Symbols are produced by the linker when a program is built. They are stripped out
of the retail product and saved in a separate (.DBG) file. This considerably
reduces file size which decreases file load time and thus increases system
performance. Symbols represent Function\API names and global variables.

The .DBG file contains symbolic information for each file. They can be found on
the SUPPORT\DEBUG\&lt;platform&gt;\SYMBOLS directory of the Windows NT
installation compact disc.

Patched builds such as Service Packs require a special set of symbols, that is a
combination of the base build and the patched symbols.

The SYMBOLS directory is divided up into seven subdirectories, called Extension
Subdirectories (note that many of the symbol files in these directories match
USER MODE components of Windows NT):

  COM - symbols for all files ending in .COM go here
  CPL - symbols for all files ending in .CPL go here.
  DLL - symbols for all files ending in .DLL go here
  DRV - symbols for all files ending in .DRV go here
  EXE - symbols for all files ending in .EXE go here
  SCR - symbols for all files ending in .SCR go here
  SYS - symbols for all files ending in .SYS go here.

The symbols must match their respective files. Symbols from a different build
give erroneous information. All of the symbol file link dates must match those
on the computer being debugged.

Setting Up a Custom Symbol Trees
--------------------------------

The Symbol Tree is the subdirectory tree on the host computer which contains the
symbol files which match the remote computer being debugged.

1. Create a Subdirectory on the host computer. For example:

  MKDIR C:\SYMBOLS

2. Always start with the base Windows NT version number. Copy the following
  files from the installation compact disc for the appropriate version:

  "XCOPY [CD Drive]:\SUPPORT\DEBUG\I386 C:\SYMBOLS /S." (without the quotation
  marks)

3. Copy the symbols for the appropriate Service Pack into the custom tree.
  Service Pack symbols can be found on FTP.MICROSOFT.COM.

  For example, the symbols for Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack 4 can be downloaded
  from the following location:

  \bussys\winnt\winnt-public\fixes\usa\NT351\ussp4\symbols

  Download the file called SYM_351&lt;X&gt;.EXE where X represents the platform
  (I for x86, A for Alpha, P for PPC).

  Decompress the files into the symbol tree. For example:

  SYM_351&lt;X&gt;.EXE -d C:\SYMBOLS

4. Copy any third-party patches, such as the Compaq SSD symbols, to the custom
  symbol tree. These symbols must be obtained from the third-party vendor.

5. If Microsoft has supplied unique fixes for your installation, copy the DBG
  file supplied with the fix into the appropriate subdirectory (for example:
  SYS, EXE, DLL).


6. If the computer is a single processor Intel system, the symbol tree is
  complete. Please see the "After the Symbol Tree is Created" section below.

Single Processor vs. Multiprocessor
-----------------------------------

Windows NT uses a special kernel for SMP systems. During installation this kernel
is renamed. It is important that the DBF file is renamed for debugging.

  NTOSKRNL.EXE  NTOSKRNL.DBG  = Single processor
  NTKRNLMP.EXE  NTKRNLMP.DBG  = Multiple processors

If the system is a Multi-Processor, do the following:

1. Change the directory to the DLL component directory. For example:

  CHDIR C:\SYMBOLS\DLL

2. Rename the uniprocessor kernel to another filename. For example:

  "RENAME NTOSKRNL.DBG NTOSKRNL.UNI" (without the quotation marks)

3. Copy the multiprocessor kernel over the uniprocessor kernel. For example:

  "COPY NTKRNLMP.DBG NTOSKRNL.DBG" (without the quotation marks)


Custom HAL.DLL
--------------

Some hardware platforms require a special Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
Driver. Like the Kernel file, the custom HAL is renamed during the installation
process. Here is a list of common HALs:

HAL files for I386 Computers:

How to Determine Which HAL to Use:

During installation, a text log file is created. This file has a line which shows
which HAL is installed during setup. If the HAL has changed after the original
Setup, the SETUP.LOG does not reflect the change. To verify, do the following:

1. Go to %SystemRoot%\REPAIR subdirectory.

2. Run ATTRIB -R -H -S SETUP.LOG to make the file visible.

3. Use Notepad to view SETUP.LOG and search for "Hal".

NOTE: This same technique can be useful to verify if a special kernel is also
used.

Copy the HAL into the Symbol Tree:

1. Change directory to \SYMBOLS\DLL.

2. Rename HAL.DBG to HAL.X86.

3. Copy the "Custom HLL.DBG" to HAL.DBG.
