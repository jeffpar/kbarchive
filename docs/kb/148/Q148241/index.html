The information in this article applies to:

- MSPRESS Running Microsoft Access for Windows 95 ISBN 1-55615-886-6 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article contains information on known errors, corrections, and comments
relating to the Microsoft Press book "Running Microsoft Access for Windows 95."

The following topics are covered:

- Pages 277-279: Example Using an Append Query to Archive Data

MORE INFORMATION
================

In addition to a description of the book's problems, this document might also
include sections labeled "Correction" and "Comments." Please note that the
"Correction" section is worded for correcting the book and does not necessarily
address the problem introduced by the book error. The "Comments" section
contains specific information for working around problems.

Pages 277-279: Example Using an Append Query to Archive Data
------------------------------------------------------------

The extended example in this section has two known problems

1. Running the qryXmplArchiveOldContracts query invokes two extra Enter
  Parameter Value dialog boxes in addition to the one shown in Figure 9-18.

2. qryXmplArchiveOldContracts fails to append the 78 rows of data to the
  tblContractHistory table due to key violations.

Correction:


Comments:

1. The extra dialog boxes arise from two superfluous fields (Expr1: and Expr2:)
  in the qryXmplArchiveOldContracts query. These two fields should be deleted.
  In addition, the corresponding fields in the tblContractHistory table should
  also be deleted (CommissionAgent3 and Commission3%).

2. The rows which qryXmplArchiveOldContracts attempts to append already exist in
  the tblContractHistory table. All of the rows from Contract Number 4642 to
  Contract Number 4748 should be deleted from the table.

Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
already contain most or all of the above corrections.
