SUMMARY
=======

This article provides more information about the ending process of Rebuild and
the entries that go into the DIRSYNC.LOG. These log messages are similar to the
following:

  07/31/95 05:03:10 | Status Microsoft(R) mail GAL Rebuild Utility V.3.2.16
  07/31/95 05:05:18 | Status Number of entries in GAL: 954
  07/31/95 05:06:45 | Status

The last two entries and the processes that take place between them are of
particular interest. When errors occur in these processes, the third status line
may not appear.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Number of Entries in GAL: message is created after a temporary Global
Address List (GAL) has been created. The number recorded as the number of
entries in the GAL is derived from a TMP0000x.NME file (the x will be a number
determined by the Rebuild program). The same file is later renamed to GAL.NME,
as long as the subsequent processes are successful. The GAL.NME is renamed just
prior to the blank status line being written to the log.

If the renaming of TMP0000x.NME to GAL.NME fails, Rebuild will try to rename
TMP0000x.NME to GAL$.NME.


After it gives this message, Rebuild starts on the creation of the Galindex file.
During this process failures can occur that are not reported in the log. The
following two types of failures cause the status line to not be displayed.

- Failure writing to file GALTMP.GLB

- Failure writing to file GALINDE$.GLB


If either of these failures occur, the renaming of GAL files is not tried, and no
final status line message appears in the log. The TMP0000x.NME file will still
be in the NME directory, and the GALTMP.GLB file is deleted.

If Rebuild is being run on a Microsoft Windows NT workstation, the following
registry entry can reduce the occurrence of this problem:

  HKey_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\
  Parameters\CacheFileTimeout=0

Notes:

- Use Add Value (not add key).

- Change the data type to REG_DWORD (default is REG_SZ).

- Reboot the machine.

The failures to write to the files can also be caused by a lack of disk space on
the server or network problems.

Generally, Rebuild failures will result in Fatal error messages being recorded in
the Directory Synchronization (Dir-Sync) log.
