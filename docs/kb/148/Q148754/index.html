-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may experience one or both of the following symptoms when you attempt to
create a file in Windows 95:

- When you attempt to use Windows Explorer or another program to create a file
  in a folder other than the root folder of a drive, the length of the file
  name seems to be limited to less than 255 characters. If you use Windows
  Explorer to move or copy a file with a very long file name to a folder other
  than the root folder of a drive, you may receive the following error
  message:

  Cannot copy &lt;file name&gt;. The file name you specified is invalid or too
  long. Specify a different filename.

- When you attempt to use Windows Explorer to create a file in the root folder
  of a drive, the length of the file name seems to be limited to 250
  characters.

These symptoms occur even though the Windows 95 documentation states that a file
name in Windows 95 can include up to 255 characters.

CAUSE
=====

Long file names are limited to 255 characters in Windows 95. However, the
maximum path length in Windows 95 is 259 characters. The maximum path length
represents the length of the file name, plus the number of characters used to
represent the drive and folder where the file is located. For example, the path
length for the file

  C:\Windows\LongFileName.extension

is 33 characters, but the file name is only 22 characters.

Because the path length is limited to 259 characters, a long file name is limited
to less than 255 characters if more than five characters are needed to represent
the drive and folder where the file is located. If five characters or less are
needed to represent the drive and folder where the file is located, the long
file name is limited to 255 characters, even if the total path length is less
than 259 characters. For example, if a file is located in the root folder of a
drive, the long file name is still limited to 255 characters, even though 256
characters could be used before the maximum path length is reached.

When you use Windows Explorer to create a file, the length of the file name is
limited to 250 characters instead of 255 characters. This is a known problem
that occurs with Windows Explorer in Windows 95. However, if you use another
program to create a file with a file name longer than 250 characters, the entire
file name is visible in Windows Explorer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around these problems, use the appropriate method:

- If you are attempting to use Windows Explorer or another program to create a
  file in a folder other than the root folder of a drive, and the length of the
  file name is limited to less than 255 characters, you may be able to use a
  longer file name if you create the file in a different folder. If you create
  the file in a folder with fewer characters in the folder name, or in a folder
  that has fewer parent folders, fewer characters are needed to represent the
  drive and folder where the file is located. This allows you to use more
  characters for the file name before the 259-character maximum path length is
  reached.

- If you are attempting to use Windows Explorer to create a file in the root
  folder of a drive, and the length of the file name is limited to 250
  characters, you may be able to work around this problem by using a different
  program to create the file. For example, if you are attempt- ing to create a
  new text document (.txt) file, use Notepad to create the file instead of
  Windows Explorer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that the 250-character file name limit on files created
in Windows Explorer is a problem with Windows 95. We are researching this
problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it
becomes available.
