The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Windows 3.x and Windows NT, when the Microsoft Exchange or Outlook client is
installed, the Internet Explorer is assigned as the WEB Browser by default.

In Windows 95, when the Microsoft Exchange or Outlook client is installed, it
will use the most-recently installed Win32 Web Browser.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To change the Web Browser that launches when embedded URLs are activated, follow
these steps:

In Windows 95:

NOTE: For this to work, you must already have a Windows 95-compatible Browser
installed such as Internet Explorer or Netscape Gold.

1. Close any Web Browsers that may be running.

2. Open Start/Settings/Control Panel/View/Options/File Types.

3. Select URL:HyperText Transfer Protocol, and click the Edit button.

4. Under Actions, select open, and click the Edit button.

5. In the "Application used to perform action:" box, click the Browse button,
  and locate the Browser that you want to launch.

6. When you next launch an embedded URL from inside Microsoft Exchange, you will
  be prompted to select this viewer as your default viewer; click Yes. This now
  will become the default Web Browser for all URL-linked applications including
  FTP, Mailto, News, and so on.

CAUTION: By saying No to making this your default browser you may experience
problems with some URLs.

In Windows 3.x:

NOTE: For this to work, you must already have a Windows 3.x-compatible Browser
installed such as Internet Explorer or Netscape.

For information on how to do this, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base and the README.WRI file that is located on the
Microsoft Exchange Client Software CD-ROM:

  Q147359 XCLN W16: URL Problems with the Windows 16-bit Exchange Client

In Windows NT:

NOTE: For this to work, you must already have a Windows NT-compatible Browser
installed such as Internet Explorer or Netscape.

CAUTION: This involves Editing the client systems Registry, proceed only after
you are certain that you understand the steps to be completed.

After you have installed the Microsoft Exchange NT Client, you will need to edit
the Registry if you are not going to use Internet Explorer, which is the
default.

Using REGEDT32.EXE open:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE on local machine
      SOFTWARE
          Microsoft
             Exchange
              Client
                    Options
                        Browser : REG_SZ : "insert path to your browser"
