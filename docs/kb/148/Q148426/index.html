IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
Error 3013, "The redirector has timed out to SERVERNAME" usually means that the
Server that you are attempting to connect to is:

- Either busy and cannot respond before the rdr timeout

- The network could be busy

- Bottleneck in the network

As to troubleshooting this problem, you may want to exhaust all means before
deciding to increase the amount of time before the redirector stops
(SESSTIMEOUT). The SESSTIMEOUT parm can be set in the following registry
location:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanmanWorkstation\Parameters

Some things you can try are to obtain a trace of the packets on the network. You
want to zoom in on the amount of time it takes for the Server to respond back to
the workstation.

Another idea is to perform what ever operations that was done backwards. If you
were connecting to ServerA from ServerB, try connecting to ServerB from ServerA.
Also have another client attempt to connect to the same server to see if both
redirectors have the same problem connecting to the same server.

You may also want to check the following items:

- Check to see that the latest network driver is installed.

- Check to determine whether the network adapter has a configuration utility
  that allows tuning parameters. If so, try maximizing the network performance.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Valid values for the SessTimeout registry key are:

  SessTimeout   REG_DWORD
  Range: 10 - 65535 seconds
  Default: 45

Additional query words: event id
