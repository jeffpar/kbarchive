SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Collaboration Data Objects (CDO) message filter objects to generate
a result set, if you filter by one of the nine documented message properties in
the following rule, an incorrect result record set may be returned. The results
should be returned by using the following documented rule from the Microsoft
Developer Network (MSDN):

  For fields of data type other than String, the MAPI search restriction type
  is RES_PROPERTY with relational operator RELOP_EQ. For fields of data type
  String, the restriction type is RES_CONTENT with fuzzy level options
  FL_SUBSTRING, FL_IGNORECASE, and FL_LOOSE. However, the following MAPI
  properties are compared using FL_PREFIX instead of FL_SUBSTRING:

- PR_ACCOUNT

- PR_BUSINESS_ADDRESS_CITY

- PR_COMPANY_NAME

- PR_DEPARTMENT_NAME

- PR_DISPLAY_NAME

- PR_GIVEN_NAME

- PR_OFFICE_LOCATION

- PR_SURNAME

- PR_TITLE

However, the result set is comprised of a SUBSTRING search rather than the
PREFIX, for example:

  FilterFields.Add CdoPR_SURNAME, "M"

This builds a filter with all of the last names that contain the letter "M",
rather than those that begin with the letter "M".

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Collaboration Data Objects (OLEMSG, CDO)

+-------------------------+
| File name | Version     | 
+-------------------------+
| Cdo.dll   | 5.5.2654.45 | 
+-------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, Exchange Server version 5.5 Service Pack 4
must be applied before you apply this fix.
