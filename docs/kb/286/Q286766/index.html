-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the Microsoft Developers Network (MSDN) Library to one
location, you are unable to change the location of the files to another drive.
Also, occasionally after you remove the product through the Add/Remove Programs
option on the Control Panel, you are still unable to reinstall the same edition
to another location. This behavior is usually due to a removal of the product by
means other than the Add/Remove Programs option but can be seen even if the
product was removed correctly but the registry entries were not successfully
updated.

CAUSE
=====

Registry entries are left behind after uninstalling the product.

RESOLUTION
==========

Remove the MSDN Library manually as directed in the following Microsoft
Knowledge Base article:

  Q240350 HOWTO: Manually Uninstall the MSDN Library

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you have multiple versions of the MSDN Library installed and only want to
remove one specific edition, you can do so by following these steps:

1. Remove the specific editions folder under the default location of:

C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\MSDN\1033

The default location for the original Microsoft Visual Studio edition is:

C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\MSDN98\1033

2. On the Start menu, type REGEDIT in the Run box, and then click OK.

3. Browse to the following key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\HTML Help Collections\Developer
  Collections\0x0409\0x039a28760

4. Delete only the key that is associated with the MSDN Library version that you
  want to uninstall. Each MSDN Library that is installed has a separate key
  under \0x0409\.

  NOTE: The key 0x039a28760 varies depending on the MSDN edition. To see the
  MSDN version information, look in the Data column or double-click (Default)
  in the right pane. With this information you can remove the correct MSDN
  version and registry key.
