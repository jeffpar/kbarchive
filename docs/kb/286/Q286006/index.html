To resolve this issue, use the following methods in the order in which they are
presented.

Install the Latest Video Driver
-------------------------------

Contact the manufacturer of your video adapter to inquire about how to obtain and
install the latest version of the video driver for your video adapter.

For information about how to contact the manufacturer of your video adapter,
click the appropriate article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q65416 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, A-K

  Q60781 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, L-P

  Q60782 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, Q-Z

If updating the video card drivers do not help, proceed to the next method.

Reduce Graphics Hardware Acceleration
-------------------------------------

To reduce graphics hardware acceleration:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. Click the Performance tab, and then click Graphics.

4. Move the Hardware Acceleration slider until it is one notch to the right of
  None (the Basic acceleration setting).

5. Click OK, and then click OK again.

6. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Yes.

MORE INFORMATION

2. Double-click System.

3. Click the Device Manager tab.

4. Click the PLUS SIGN (+) next to "Display adapters" to expand the branch.

5. In the "Display adapters" branch, note the manufacturer and the model of your
  video adapter, and then click OK.

6. Close Control Panel.

More About DDHelp
-----------------

DDHelp.exe is DirectDraw?s "helper" bootstrap. Its purpose is to make first
contact with the video driver, assess its DirectDraw capabilities, and send the
driver into DirectDraw compatibility mode.

This is very simplistic. However, when a user has display issues in a game or a
game doesn't launch, it may be because the game can?t get the video driver to
switch to the proper resolution to run it. This will sometimes manifest itself
as an error in the file DDHelp.

Another one of DDHelp?s functions is to perform the resolution switching chores
for DirectDraw and Direct3D.
