SYMPTOMS
========

When you make changes to your Internet Information Services (IIS) configuration
through the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) or through scripting, some
changes may not be saved after you use the iisreset command from the MMC or from
a command prompt with no switches.

CAUSE
=====

The IISReset command line tool waits for a normal shutdown of the services
before it starts them again. Because of the number of services that are
dependent on the IISAdmin service, the shutdown may not occur in a timely
manner. When this happens, IISReset forces the shutdown of the services. This
can result in metabase changes that are not saved properly.

WORKAROUND
==========

To save the IIS configuration to the metabase, use the net stop and the net
start commands to stop and start your services, or stop and start the services
from the MMC snap-in. To locate the snap-in, follow these steps:

1. On the task bar click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative
  Tools, and then click Services.

2. Right-click IISAdmin Service and click Stop.

The following examples illustrate the commands that are necessary to stop and
start IIS from a command prompt. To stop IIS from a command prompt:

  net stop iisadmin /y

NOTE: Take note of each of the services that depend on the IISAdmin Service,
because you need to restart each of these services in the next step.

To start IIS from a command prompt:

  net start w3svc
  net start msftpsvc
  net start smtpsvc
  net start &lt;short name for any other services that are listed when you stop IIS&gt;

NOTE: Because W3SVC and the other services that are listed depend on the IISAdmin
Service, the the IISAdmin Service is started automatically when the W3SVC
service is started.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Do not use IISReset to force IIS configuration changes to be saved to the
metabase. Only use IISReset to recover from serious problems that a Web server
experiences. For example, when a Web server stops responding (hangs) or crashes,
or when 100% CPU utilization occurs.

For more information, see the notes in the IISReset window in the MMC.
