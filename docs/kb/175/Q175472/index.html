SUMMARY
=======

IPX and NETBIOS interfaces require network addresses. This article presents a
step-by-step example on how to use Netbios API call to get the network adapter
addresses from Microsoft Visual Basic.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE from Visual Basic. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a CommandButton to Form1. Its default name is Command1.

3. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Form1:

     Option Explicit

     Private Const NCBASTAT = &amp;H33
     Private Const NCBNAMSZ = 16
     Private Const HEAP_ZERO_MEMORY = &amp;H8
     Private Const HEAP_GENERATE_EXCEPTIONS = &amp;H4
     Private Const NCBRESET = &amp;H32

     Private Type NCB
          ncb_command As Byte 'Integer
          ncb_retcode As Byte 'Integer
          ncb_lsn As Byte 'Integer
          ncb_num As Byte ' Integer
          ncb_buffer As Long 'String
          ncb_length As Integer
          ncb_callname As String * NCBNAMSZ
          ncb_name As String * NCBNAMSZ
          ncb_rto As Byte 'Integer
          ncb_sto As Byte ' Integer
          ncb_post As Long
          ncb_lana_num As Byte 'Integer
          ncb_cmd_cplt As Byte  'Integer
          ncb_reserve(9) As Byte ' Reserved, must be 0
          ncb_event As Long
     End Type
     Private Type ADAPTER_STATUS
          adapter_address(5) As Byte 'As String * 6
          rev_major As Byte 'Integer
          reserved0 As Byte 'Integer
          adapter_type As Byte 'Integer
          rev_minor As Byte 'Integer
          duration As Integer
          frmr_recv As Integer
          frmr_xmit As Integer
          iframe_recv_err As Integer
          xmit_aborts As Integer
          xmit_success As Long
          recv_success As Long
          iframe_xmit_err As Integer
          recv_buff_unavail As Integer
          t1_timeouts As Integer
          ti_timeouts As Integer
          Reserved1 As Long
          free_ncbs As Integer
          max_cfg_ncbs As Integer
          max_ncbs As Integer
          xmit_buf_unavail As Integer
          max_dgram_size As Integer
          pending_sess As Integer
          max_cfg_sess As Integer
          max_sess As Integer
          max_sess_pkt_size As Integer
          name_count As Integer
     End Type
     Private Type NAME_BUFFER
          name  As String * NCBNAMSZ
          name_num As Integer
          name_flags As Integer
     End Type
     Private Type ASTAT
          adapt As ADAPTER_STATUS
          NameBuff(30) As NAME_BUFFER
     End Type

     Private Declare Function Netbios Lib "netapi32.dll" _
             (pncb As NCB) As Byte
     Private Declare Sub CopyMemory Lib "kernel32" Alias "RtlMoveMemory" ( _
             hpvDest As Any, ByVal hpvSource As Long, ByVal cbCopy As Long)
     Private Declare Function GetProcessHeap Lib "kernel32" () As Long
     Private Declare Function HeapAlloc Lib "kernel32" _
             (ByVal hHeap As Long, ByVal dwFlags As Long, _
             ByVal dwBytes As Long) As Long
     Private Declare Function HeapFree Lib "kernel32" (ByVal hHeap As Long, _
             ByVal dwFlags As Long, lpMem As Any) As Long

4. Add the following code to Command1_Click event procedure:

     Sub Command1_Click()
         Dim myNcb As NCB
         Dim bRet As Byte
         myNcb.ncb_command = NCBRESET
         bRet = Netbios(myNcb)

         myNcb.ncb_command = NCBASTAT
         myNcb.ncb_lana_num = 0
         myNcb.ncb_callname = "*               "

         Dim myASTAT As ASTAT, tempASTAT As ASTAT
         Dim pASTAT As Long
         myNcb.ncb_length = Len(myASTAT)
         Debug.Print Err.LastDllError
         pASTAT = HeapAlloc(GetProcessHeap(), HEAP_GENERATE_EXCEPTIONS _
                  Or HEAP_ZERO_MEMORY, myNcb.ncb_length)
         If pASTAT = 0 Then
            Debug.Print "memory allcoation failed!"
            Exit Sub
         End If
         myNcb.ncb_buffer = pASTAT
         bRet = Netbios(myNcb)
         Debug.Print Err.LastDllError
         CopyMemory myASTAT, myNcb.ncb_buffer, Len(myASTAT)
         MsgBox Hex(myASTAT.adapt.adapter_address(0)) &amp; " " &amp; _
                Hex(myASTAT.adapt.adapter_address(1)) _
                &amp; " " &amp; Hex(myASTAT.adapt.adapter_address(2)) &amp; " " _
                &amp; Hex(myASTAT.adapt.adapter_address(3)) _
                &amp; " " &amp; Hex(myASTAT.adapt.adapter_address(4)) &amp; " " _
                &amp; Hex(myASTAT.adapt.adapter_address(5))
         HeapFree GetProcessHeap(), 0, pASTAT
     End Sub

5. Press the F5 key to run the program.

6. Click on Command1. Note that the network adapter address is displayed in a
  message box.
