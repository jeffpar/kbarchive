SUMMARY
=======

If you want to add additional drives to an existing cluster, special procedures
may be necessary. This article discusses how to add additional drives on a
shared SCSI bus when the system does not support hot swapping.

MORE INFORMATION
================


Unless your drive cabinet supports hot swapping, you must shut down and turn off
both cluster nodes to add or replace SCSI drives because the shared SCSI bus is
disconnected during this procedure. If you Disconnect the bus while the cluster
is in use, you may experience data loss or other failures. Microsoft recommends
that you turn off all attached hardware while you perform this procedure.

To add additional drives to an existing cluster:

1. Change the startup values for the Clusdisk device and the Cluster Server
  service:

   - Change the Startup value for the Cluster Disk device (Microsoft Windows NT
     4.0) or the Clusdisk device (Microsoft Windows 2000) to Disabled.
   - Change the Startup value for the Cluster Server service to Disabled.

To do so, use the appropriate method for your version of Microsoft Windows.

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

  a. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

  b. Double-click Devices.

  c. In the list of devices, click Cluster Disk, and then click Startup.

  d. Change the setting to Manual, click OK, and then click Yes.

  e. Close the Devices window.

  f. In Control Panel, double-click Services.

  g. In the list of services, click Cluster Server, and then click Startup.

  h. Change the setting to Manual, click OK, and then click Yes.

  i. Close the Services window, and then close Control Panel.

Windows 2000
------------

  a. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools, and then
     click Computer Management.

  b. In the left pane, click Device Manager.

  c. On the View menu, click Show Hidden Devices.

  d. In the right pane, under the Non-Plug and Play Drivers branch,
     double-click Clusdisk.

  e. Click the Driver tab.

  f. In the Type box, click Disabled, and then click OK.

  g. In the left pane, click the plus sign (+) next to "Services and
     Applications" to expand the branch.

  h. Under the "Services and Applications" branch, click Services.

  i. In the right pane, double-click the Cluster service.

  j. In the "Startup type" box, click Disabled, and then click OK.

  k. Close the Computer Management tool.

2. Shut down both nodes and turn off both computers.

3. Turn off SCSI devices on the shared SCSI bus.

4. Add or replace drives on the shared SCSI bus.

5. Make sure that every device on the shared SCSI bus has a unique SCSI ID.

  NOTE: Remember that the two SCSI host adapters each use a different SCSI ID
  (usually 6 and 7).

6. Make sure that the bus is terminated properly.

7. Restart node 1 and allow the boot process to complete. Turn on node 2 and
  press the SPACEBAR when the OS Loader screen appears.

  NOTE: Do not allow Windows NT to start on the second node.

8. On the first node, use Windows NT Disk Administrator (Windisk.exe) to
  partition and format the drive, and then assign drive letters to the new
  disks that are available on the shared SCSI bus.

9. Select the partition, click Properties on the Tools menu, and then label the
  partition to match its corresponding drive letter. For example, the label for
  drive E drive should be "E". Repeat this for each partition.

10. On the Partition menu, click Configuration, and then click Save.

11. Restore the original startup values for the Clusdisk device and the Cluster
  Server service:

   - Change the Startup value for the Cluster Disk device or Clusdisk device to
     System.
   - Change the Startup value for the Cluster Server service to Automatic.

  To do so, use the appropriate method in step 1 for your version of Windows.

12. Restart node 1, press the SPACEBAR when the OS Loader screen appears to
  pause the startup process.

13. Select the operating system you want, and then allow Node 2 to start.

  NOTE: Do not allow Windows NT to start on node 1.

14. On the second node, run Windows NT Disk Administrator (Windisk.exe) for
  Windows NT 4.0 or Disk Management (diskmgmt.msc) for Windows 2000 and
  Windows .NET, and then assign drive letters to the new disks available on
  the shared SCSI bus. These drive letters should match the drive labels
  created in step 9.

15. Restore the original startup values for the Clusdisk device and the Cluster
  Server service:

   - Change the Startup value for the Cluster Disk device or Clusdisk device to
     System.
   - Change the Startup value for the Cluster Server service to Automatic.

  To do so, use the appropriate method in step 1 for your version of Windows.

16. Restart node 2 (allow it to do a full restart).

17. Create a physical disk resource for each new disk using Cluster
  Administrator and bring the disks online.

18. If there are no errors, select the Windows NT Server operating system on the
  second node and press ENTER. If there are errors, check the SCSI cabling,
  termination, and SCSI ID assignment for proper configuration.

19. When the node comes online and appears so in Cluster Administrator, try
  moving the group to the node. Check for the ability to go online on each
  node.

NOTE: For additional information, consult Chapter 4 of the MSCS Administrator's
Guide, or the Support/Books folder on CD-ROM 1.
