SUMMARY
=======

This article assumes that the Microsoft Exchange Internet Mail Connector, (IMC),
or Internet Mail Service (IMS) and the Microsoft Mail connector are both
installed and working correctly. This article also assumes that the IMC or IMS
is providing Internet connectivity for Microsoft Mail for PC Networks users via
Microsoft Exchange Server's Microsoft Mail connector.

When Microsoft Mail users send mail to a list server on the Internet, there is a
possibility that a looping message can be generated.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following configuration results in the possibility of generating a looping
message:

  A Microsoft Exchange Server email environment with an IMC or IMS,
  and a Microsoft Mail connector installed and running.

  The Microsoft Mail connector provides connectivity for Microsoft
  Mail users to send mail to the Internet.

In this example, a user on Microsoft Mail sends a subscription request to the
list server. The list server sends back an acknowledgement that the user was
added to the list. However, if while the message is being routed back to the
Microsoft Mail user's mailbox, the Microsoft Exchange PCMTAs (or MSMail MTAs)
encounter a problem delivering the mail to a Microsoft Mail 3.x Postoffice (PO),
this LISTSERVE acknowledgement message will be sent back to the list server from
POSTMASTER (PCMTA or MSMail MTA) with a Non-Delivery Report (NDR).

Causes of a PCMTA or MSMail MTA NDRing a message include:

- Mailbag contention on the INQUEUE3, outbound PO queue, or the user's KEY and
  MBG

- Either the INQUEUE3.KEY, &lt;outbound PO queue&gt;.KEY, or
  &lt;user-id&gt;.KEY file is full (already containing pointers to 4096 active
  messages).

This is expected behavior from Microsoft Mail and from the Microsoft Exchange
PCMTA service. If the message is not delivered to the recipient, the message is
NDR'd.

The problem occurs when the NDR message gets delivered to the list server. The
message is now from Microsoft Mail's POSTMASTER to the list server. When the
list server receives this email, it is parsed and interpreted as malformed
subscription request instead of an NDR. Since the message does not contain the
proper syntax for list server "subscription", the list server responds to the
email with a new message, typically including instructions and syntax for the
proper way to join a list. This response is now destined for the POSTMASTER
(PCMTA or Microsoft Mail MTA) account at the PO where the mailbag contention
occurred, not to the Microsoft Mail user. So the mail will travel into Microsoft
Exchange via the IMC or IMS, get routed to the Microsoft Mail connector (where
the address is translated to valid Microsoft Mail
&lt;10&gt;/&lt;10&gt;/POSTMASTER syntax) and will route to the POSTMASTER's PO.
Unless there has been a POSTMASTER mailbox created on this Microsoft Mail PO
(and assuming this mailbox is not full, in other words, less than 4096 messages
pending), the message will again NDR because there is no POSTMASTER account on
the Microsoft Mail PO.

This loop can be generated every time there is failure to deliver mail from a
list server to a Microsoft Mail user. Mailbag contention, and retry timeouts can
occur in Microsoft Mail environments, and this can result in the loop.

Detection:

If a loop is suspected, enabling maximum logging on the MSMI service and
performing a "View, Find..." on the application event log specifying the
following criteria may aid in tracking down the problem Microsoft Mail file, and
the source of the loop on the Internet:

  Source: MSExchangeMSMI
  Description: POSTMASTER

Considerable recurrence of the following events with the same details may
indicate the loop endpoints:

  2444
  Source: MSExchangeMSMI
  Category: Routing
  Description:

     Message ID &lt;xxxxxxxx&gt; processed from INQUEUE

     From: [encapsulated X.400&lt;listserv subscription alias&gt;@&lt;domain&gt;]
     To: &lt;network name&gt;/&lt;po name&gt;/POSTMASTER

  2448
  Source: MSExchangeMSMI
  Category: Sent
  Description:

     Message ID
     &lt;C=xx;A= ;P=xxxx;l=xxxx&gt;
     received from Exchange

     Message ID &lt;xxxxxxxx&gt; created in MS Mail

     From: [encapsulated X.400&lt;listserv subscription alias&gt;@&lt;domain&gt;]
     To: &lt;network name&gt;/&lt;po name&gt;/POSTMASTER

  10000
  Source: MSExchangeMSMI
  Category: Debug Data
  Description

     Recipient is MS:&lt;network name&gt;/&lt;po name&gt;/POSTMASTER

Once the Internet email domain that is the source of the loop has been
identified, the IMC, IMS, or firewall host can be configured to refuse mail from
the specific host until the Microsoft Mail file problem is remedied. For the
Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 IMS, the IMS Properties, Connections,
Accept or Reject by Host, can be configured to reject connections based on IP
address. If using an intermediary host between Microsoft Exchange Server and the
Internet, consult that host's documentation for information regarding forced
connection rejection.

1. Create a POSTMASTER account on every Microsoft Mail post office so that the
  message can be delivered. Maintain these mailboxes to ensure they don't fill
  up.

2. Create a Microsoft Exchange mailbox to receive the mail. The mailbox should
  have a Microsoft Mail proxy address created for *each* Microsoft Mail PO. An
  example is NETWORK/PO1/POSTMASTER. Adding this for each PO as a proxy on the
  Microsoft Exchange mailbox will enable the list server's mail to be
  delivered.

NOTE: The MSPROXY.DLL will not generate a POSTMASTER proxy if you create a
Microsoft Exchange mailbox called POSTMASTER. Instead, it will generate the
Microsoft Mail address of NETWORK/PO/POSTMAST0.
