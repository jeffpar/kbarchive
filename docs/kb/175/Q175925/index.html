-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the WordBasic Print statement with commas to send tab-delimited
output to a text file, the text is no longer separated by tabs when you convert
and run the macro in Visual Basic for Applications.

CAUSE
=====

The Print statement in WordBasic differs from the equivalent Print # statement
in Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications. In Visual Basic for Applications,
you need to specify the separator by using the vbTab constant.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft provides programming examples for illustration only, without warranty

article assumes that you are familiar with the programming language being
demonstrated and the tools used to create and debug procedures. Microsoft
support professionals can help explain the functionality of a particular
procedure, but they will not modify these examples to provide added
functionality or construct procedures to meet your specific needs. If you have
limited programming experience, you may want to contact a Microsoft Certified

The following converted WordBasic sample code outputs the variables
(item1$,item2$, and so on) to a text file with the print fields separated by tab
characters:

     Sub MAIN
        ' Define the variables.
        item1$ = "item1"
        item2$ = "item2"
        item3$ = "item3"
        item4$ = "item4"
        ' Open the file for output.
        Open "C:\Test.txt" For Output As #1
        ' Print to the output file.
        Print #1, item1$, item2$, item3$, item4$
        ' Close the output file.
        Close #1
     End Sub

In Visual Basic, the same sample code prints the fields separated by spaces. To
work around this problem, use the vbTab constant, as in the following
statement:

  Print #1, item1$ &amp; vbTab; item2$ &amp; vbTab; item3$ &amp; vbTab; item4$

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information about Print # Statement, from the Visual Basic Editor,
click the Office Assistant, type "print to a file" (without the quotation
marks), click Search, and then click to view "Print # Statement."

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If the Assistant is not able to answer your query, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q176476 OFF: Office Assistant Not Answering Visual Basic Questions

NOTE: If your programming language was written to call WordBasic commands, and
you are anticipating interacting with the Microsoft Word Visual Basic for
Applications language for all future development needs, you should convert your
code from WordBasic to Microsoft Word Visual Basic for Applications.
