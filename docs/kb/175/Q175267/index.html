The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

The current deployment tools do not allow for the detection of a modem but do
allow for a user to specify a modem and communications port in the answer file.
By default, only modem information files supplied with Windows NT 4.0 are
available to be installed during deployment. It may be possible to include
third-party modem information files into the answer file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To start, you need the modems information file, in this case Mdmvikp.inf for a
Viking Netlink 33.6 PC-Card modem, copied into the INF directory on the
workstation. The easiest way to accomplish this is to place Mdmvikp.inf on the
distribution server in the following directory structure.

  I386\$OEM$\$$&lt;-- (this indicates the NT Target Path)\Inf\Mdmvikp.inf

NOTE: For installation to bring in these additional directories under the I386
directory, the OEMPreInstall=yes parameter must be set in the Unattended section
of the installation script file.

After the information file is in place, you need to get the modem description
from the information file. In most cases, you can search the information file
for a section called [Strings], underneath is a list of the modems that the
information file supports.

MDMVIKP.INF

  [Strings]
  ClassName = "Modem"
  Mfg = "Viking Components, Inc."

  Modem1 = "Viking Components, Inc. NETLINK 33.6 PC-CARD Fax+Data"
  Modem2 = "Viking Components, Inc. NETLINK 33.6 PC-CARD Fax+Data"
  Modem2.5 = "NETLINK 33.6 PC-CARD Fax+Data"

In this example, you are installing the "NETLINK 33.6 PC-CARD Fax+Data" the
[ModemParameters] section is where you type in the modem description of your
modem. One information file may have support for several modems, so be sure to
pick out the correct one. To determine which modem description to use, when more
than one modem description is specified in the information file supplied by the
manufacturer, use the Control Panel Modem tool on a computer that has Windows NT
and the modem installed.

To find the modem description, perform the following steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then
  double-click Modems.

2. Click the General tab to find the Modem Description under the column marked
  Modem.

  [ServicesSection]
  RAS = RASParamSection

  [Modem]
  InstallModem = ModemParameters

  [ModemParameters]
  COM2 = " NETLINK 33.6 PC-CARD Fax+Data"

  [RASParamSection]
  PortSections = RASPORT
  DialoutProtocols = TCP/IP

  [RASPORT]
  PortName = COM2
  DeviceType = Modem
  PortUsage = DialOut

Because detection is not run, we must specify a communications port. Install the
modem manually through the Control Panel Modems tool if there is a problem that
needs troubleshooting, and then contact the hardware vendor for any information
or updates.
