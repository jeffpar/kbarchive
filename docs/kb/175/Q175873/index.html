------------------------------------------------

To fly an aircraft or adventure from Flight Shop or from versions of Microsoft
Flight Simulator earlier than Flight Simulator 98, you must convert the aircraft
or adventure to the Flight Simulator 98/2000 format. To do this, use one of the
following programs.

- Adventure Converter 2000 - This program is included with Flight Simulator
  2000.

- Flight Shop Converter 98 - This program is available as a free download from
  the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/games/fs2000/downloads_archive.asp

You can use Aircraft and Adventure Converter 2000 or Flight Shop Converter 98 to
convert aircraft and adventures from Flight Shop or from versions of Flight
Simulator earlier than Flight Simulator 98. Both of these tools can convert the
following types of files to Flight Simulator 98 format:

  
  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | File type             | File extension                       | Example      | 
  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Aircraft file         | .AIR                                 | NW747.AIR    |

  | Aircraft texture file | .xAF (where x is a
         number) | NW747.0AF    | 
  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  +-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Flight file*          | .STN                                 | TIWTOPAE.STN |
