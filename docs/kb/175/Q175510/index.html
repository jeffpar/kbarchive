SUMMARY
=======

VB5DCOM.EXE is a Visual Basic sample application that demonstrates how to use
WithEvents and CallBacks remotely via DCOM (Distributed Component Object
Model).

NOTE: Building DCOM Application with Microsoft Visual Basic is only enabled in
the Enterprise Editions of Visual Basic 5.0 and 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are using Visual Basic 6.0, see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
articles:

  Q266717 HOWTO: Create a DCOM Client/Server Application by Using Visual Basic

  Q267836 HOWTO: Create a DCOM Client/Server with Events by Using Visual Basic

For additional help on how to set security and how to troubleshoot DCOM issues,
see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q268550 HOWTO: Use Dcomcnfg for a Visual Basic DCOM Client/Server Application

  Q269330 HOWTO: Troubleshoot DCOM for Visual Basic Client/Server Applications

VB5DCOM.EXE also addresses all of the security settings that are required to make
DCOM function correctly with Visual Basic using DCOM Config. It even
demonstrates how to check a client machines registry to confirm that DCOM is
installed on Windows 95 platforms and enabled on Windows NT, Windows 2000, and
Windows 98. If DCOM is not present on the Windows 95 machine, then it presents
the user with the opportunity to immediately download the necessary DCOM files
from the Microsoft Web site.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  Vb5dcom.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/vb60ent/Sample29/1/W9XNT4/EN-US/Vb5dcom.exe)

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

Place the file Vb5dcom.exe in a root directory of a drive that has at least 150KB
of available space. This a self-extracting executable so it will create the
proper folders for you and place all the files in their respective locations.
Execute the file Vb5dcom.exe. You will now have a DCOMDemo folder with separate
Client and Server folders.

Open the server project \DCOMDemo\Server\DCOMDemoServer.vbp. In the project's
properties, make sure that the "remote server files" option on the component tab
is checked and make an executable of the server. The server will now be
registered on your machine and you will have a .vbr file containing the registry
entries for the server. Close the server project.

Open the client project \DCOMDemo\Client\DCOMDemoClient.vbp. Set a reference to
the DCOMDemoServer in the projects references. Run the project locally to check
for problems before distributing to other machines for testing remotely.

See the included file \DCOMDemo\Permissions.txt if you encounter problems (such
as Error 70 - Permission denied).
