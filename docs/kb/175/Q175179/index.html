SUMMARY
=======

VBFTP.EXE is a sample that implements FTP connection, download, and upload using
the WinInet FTP API from Visual Basic. It demonstrates the APIs and techniques
to set FTP connection attributes and transfer mode that are not exposed inthe MS
Internet Transfer Control.

The sample requires Visual Basic 5 Service Pack 2 or later or Visual Studio
Service Pack 2 installed to run because it uses the updated comctl32.ocx from
those Service Packs.

When adding FTP functionality to your application, it is important to understand
the capability and limitation of each of the different Internet technologies. At
the lowest level, you could use the Microsoft Winsock Control to send commands
directly to FTP server port 21. The sequence and syntax of the commands you send
to the server would have to follow the specification of the FTP protocol. The
WinInet FTP API wraps the socket code and most low-level FTP commands and
provides a set of much simpler task-oriented APIs that do not require detailed
knowledge of FTP protocol. However, there is a chance that some FTP servers use
FTP commands not implemented by WinInet. If this happens, you have to use the
Microsoft Winsock Control to communicate with the server directly at the
protocol level. Test your FTP server with the VBFTPJR sample before you decide
whether to choose WinInet API or the Winsock Control. The Microsoft Internet
Transfer Control, on the other hand, offers a more simplified interface than
WinInet but offers less flexibility and cannot be used if you want to customize
the connection and transfer mode.

If you are using a proxy to access an FTP server, the proxy has to be capable of
handling FTP commands and cannot be a CERN proxy. Please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base for more information:
