A. Installation Notes

To run A Bridge Too Far on a Macintosh computer, you need:

Power Macintosh personal computer.

16 megabytes (MB) of RAM.

At least 40 MB of available hard disk space.

4X CD-ROM drive or higher.

Video card that supports 800 x 600 resolution or higher at "Thousands
  of colors."

System 7.5 or later.

Headphones or speakers (recommended).

28.8 modem for head-to-head play.

B. Hardware and System Compatibility: Performance Issues

It is recommended that you turn Virtual Memory ON when running A Bridge
Too Far. With Virtual Memory turned on, A Bridge Too Far's RAM requirements
drop by roughly 1.5 megabytes.

To change A Bridge Too Far's memory settings, click on it in the Finder and
press Command+I or choose Get Info from the Finder's File menu.  Enter the
desired value into the Preferred Size box.

Here's a chart of screen resolution settings and memory requirements for A
Bridge Too Far.

Resolution     Preferred Size      Preferred Size
              (with VM on)        (with VM off)
800x600         15000k              16500k
832x624         15500k              17000k
1024x768        16500k              18000k
1280x1024       20000k              21500k

Users of slower machines may experience a delay in gameplay when A Bridge
Too Far is loading game data. Please do not restart your computer if this
occurs.

To improve game performance:

Press the Spacebar to display the menubar.

Select Preferences.

Set the Game Speed to Fast.

Check Remove Trees.

Check Remove KIA Soldiers.

Removing trees and KIA soldiers is not persistent across game sessions.
Each time you begin A Bridge Too Far, you will need to reselect Remove
Trees and Remove KIA Soldiers in the Close Combat Options dialog box to
improve game performance.

Note for 16Mb PowerMac Users:

If you have a PowerMac with 16Mb of RAM, you must turn Virtual Memory ON
before playing A Bridge Too Far. Your Virtual Memory must be set to at
least 24Mb and your monitor set to a resolution of 832x624 pixels or
smaller. The maximum required Virtual Memory may vary depending on the
version of MacOS you are running, and what extensions you are loading. If
A Bridge To Far fails to load with your current VM setting, increase this
setting.

C. Head-to-Head Play

If you use international characters (high ASCII) during chat in
head-to-head play between a Macintosh computer and a PC, the character
display will be garbled.

Information

Regardless of which speed (Slow, Medium, or Fast) you have selected in
  the Game Speed box in the Close Combat Options dialog box, during
  head-to-head play game speed is always Medium.

When you see a value for percentage done, it refers to percentage of
  time complete. For instance, if a battle is five days long and you have
  completed one day, you are 20 percent done.

The numeric keypad does not work during chat. You will need to use the
  number keys at the top of your keyboard.

The progress of XXX Corps is shown on the maps of the Briefing and
  Supply screens by a wide green or yellow line. Green indicates XXX
  Corps has been or is currently at that operation, while yellow shows
  the operation where they are about to arrive.

When defining deployment zones using Battlemaker, you must allow one
  square for each additional force added to your original units or you
  may have deployment errors where not all of your units can be deployed
  at the start of the battle.

When playing a Grand Campaign or the Nijmegen Sector Campaign, the
  operations for Nijmegen River Crossing and The Island begin with the
  arrival of XXX Corps. The initial day number you see is an estimate of
  when they arrive and may change according to gameplay results. For the
  Nijmegen River Crossing, it will begin two hours after XXX Corps has
  arrived at the Nijmegen Bridge operation unless XXX Corps arrives after
  1200 hours. In this case, the Nijmegen River Crossing will start at
  1000 hours the next day.

When playing a Grand Campaign or the Arnhem Sector Campaign, the Arnhem
  Relief Attempt operation will only start if the allies in the Arnhem
  Bridge operation make it to the Arnhem bridge.

Sometimes during gameplay, soldiers under a Defend order may shoot at
  enemies you cannot see on the game screen. You learn about enemy
  soldiers through observation. Initially, you may only see a red dot on
  your map monitor representing enemy troops. You won't be able to see
  the actual enemy soldiers, but you will be able to see muzzle flashes
  if they fire at you. Through continued observation, enemy soldiers will
  be listed on your soldier monitor, but they will show only grayed-out
  information or question marks. When you have had the enemy in your
  sights for some time, you will be able to get detailed information on
  their physical and mental state in the soldier monitor just as you can
  for your own men.

When you use the Requisition screen to add new troops, you are not
  guaranteed their exact experience and morale levels. The bars you see
  on the Requisition screen represent your request. Once you return to a
  battle, you will receive troops close to the levels you requested but
  they may differ slightly because of the actual quality and rank of the
  soldiers received.

You can customize three types of Battlemaker files. The first is a
  points-only file where both players can requisition equipment based on
  the points allocated to them in the file. The second type of file has
  troops that are already allocated and there are no additional
  requisition points. In this type of Battlemaker file, players go
  immediately into battle. The third type of Battlemaker file is a
  combination of the first two types and has both allocated troops and
  requisition points. During the requisition phase in this type of battle,
  a player cannot alter established troop allocations. Players can get
  new troops only through available requisition points.

When you issue any kind of move order to a unit, that unit will attempt
  to deploy behind protective terrain in the direction of the move. For
  example, if you give a move order to the north, the soldiers in that
  unit will look for cover to use against enemy soldiers to the north of
  them. With this method, you can use short move orders to reposition
  teams in buildings.

When you issue a fire order to a target out of the line of sight (red
  fire line), the order may not be disobeyed if the unit can move closer
  to the target and get in line of sight there. If still out of the line
  of sight, the order will be canceled, but this may result in
  unanticipated movement by your troops. It is generally best to only
  give direct fire orders to those targets you can see.

Corrections

On page 13 of the manual, the information about the Hide order is
incorrect. Units given a Hide order will not fire back if fired on and
will only fire if an enemy unit comes within 30 meters of their location.
Once they start firing, they may continue to fire at other targets until
order is restored and they revert back to hidden status.

On page 15 of the manual, a prone soldier can only throw a grenade up to
1/2 its normal range.

On page 15 of the manual, prisoners will follow the team that captured
them around the map. If prisoners move near a lower value team belonging
to the side of the capturing team, they will start following that team.
Should no enemy team be near the prisoners because the capturing team has
been eliminated, prisoners will free themselves and run for the friendly
edge of the map.

On page 17 of the manual, if both sides agree to a ceasefire but one side
controls no victory locations on that map, the side with no victory
locations will be forced to flee the map. Also, if you choose to flee,
soldiers near enemy teams or belonging to static units such as 88 FlaK guns
will be lost. The confirmation dialog box will tell you how many soldiers
you lose if you choose to flee. If the number is unacceptable, click Cancel
and try to move friendly teams away from enemy teams and then try to flee
again.

On page 22 of the manual, the Stunned action does not occur. G.I. is also
used for British and Polish infantrymen.

On page 28 of the manual, the Supply screen is only available for Grand
Campaign games. For all other campaigns and operations, supply is handled
automatically.

On page 57 of the manual, the information about DirectPlay TCP is no longer
appropriate, as the feature has been removed from A Bridge Too Far. Also,
there are the following changes in terminology:

Close Combat TCP is now TCP/IP for Internet or LAN Play.

DirectPlay Modem is now Modem Connection For DirectPlay.

DirectPlay Serial is now Serial Connection For DirectPlay.
