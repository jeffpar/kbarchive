IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW) is logging the following event:

  Event Id: 2025
  Source: FPNWSrv
  Type: Warning
  Description: The server detected attempted packet spoofing for client
  "xxx" on connection "yyy". The connection has been closed.

CAUSE
=====

It is possible that a router on the LAN has been configured to spoof IPX, SPX,
or NetBIOS over IPX to keep packets alive. The built-in security check of the
FPNW server is detecting this spoof and closing the connection. This is by
design.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, do one of the following:

- Disable IPX/SPX packet spoofing on your routers

  -or-

- Disable this behavior within FPNW by adding a registry entry. This entry is
  not in the registry by default, it must be added manually. To add this entry
  to the registry, perform the following steps:

  WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
  require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee
  that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be
  solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
  Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
  Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
  Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

  1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), and go to the following subkey:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
     \FPNWsrv\Parameters

     NOTE: The registry key above is all one path; it has been wrapped for
     readability.

  2. On the Edit menu, click Add Value and type the following entry:

     Value Name: AllowableBadSequencePkts
     Data Type:  REG_DWORD
     Value:   0
     (Default:   10)

  3. Stop and restart the FPNW server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In an IPX/SPX environment connections between hosts (clients and/or servers) may
at times go idle. The following may occur:

- With an IPX-based connection, a server will intermittently send IPX Watchdog
  packets to a connected client to ensure that the client is still connected.

- With either an SPX- or NWLINK- (NetBIOS over IPX) based connection, both the
  client and the server (or two connected servers) will send probe packets to
  one another, ensuring that the other computer is still detecting the other
  computer.

In a LAN environment, there is very little overhead associated with these
keep-alive packets. In an environment where the cost of the WAN link is based on
usage, these keep-alive packets may cause the WAN link to be opened frequently
or possibly to remain up indefinitely, incurring very high costs.

Some WAN routers have the ability to spoof these keep-alive packets. When the
router sees that a keep-alive packet is to be forwarded over the WAN it silently
discards the packet and responds to the originating server or client as though
the router were the remote server or client. The WAN connection is not opened
and no charges are incurred.

When FPNW receives these spoofed packets, it will view them as a possible
security breach by default and close the connection with the remote client or
server.
