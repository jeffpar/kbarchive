SUMMARY
=======

You may be unable to connect, or have difficulty remaining connected to MSN, The
Microsoft Network. Some modems may require extra settings or specific
configurations to connect to MSN.

The following table lists extra modem settings and configurations that may help
specific modems connect to MSN.

NOTE: Rockwell settings may work for any modem that uses the Rockwell chipset,
including Boca, Zoltrix, and Zoom 14.4 modems.

*UARTless Boca Modems: Some of the Boca modems use software drivers. Due to the
lack of a UART chip, you must contact the modem manufacturer to obtain the
proper drivers.
