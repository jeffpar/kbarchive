-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running a Visual FoxPro program that displays a WAIT WINDOW on activation
of a Top-Level form, the Top-Level form stops responding. The Top-Level form
does not close. The WAIT WINDOW does not close. If the Visual FoxPro desktop is
not hidden, it can be activated to access the Command window either by clicking
it or by clicking the button on the Windows Taskbar. Upon reactivating the
Top-Level form by clicking the Windows Taskbar button for the Top-Level form, a
transparent copy of the Top-Level form appears but the Top-Level form is still
unresponsive. Quit Visual FoxPro to eliminate the Top-Level form.

CAUSE
=====

There is a WAIT WINDOW "some message" NOWAIT command in the Activate method of
the Top-Level form, which is followed by the Thisform.Release command. The
problem still occurs if there is other code between the WAIT WINDOW command and
the Thisform.Release command.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are three possible workarounds, depending on what is desired:

- Use WAIT WINDOW "some message" TIMEOUT 1.

  -or-

  Use a number greater than one.

- Remove the WAIT WINDOW completely.

- Use WAIT WINDOW "some message" TIMEOUT 0.

  -or-

  Remove the TIMEOUT clause completely. Clicking the mouse is necessary in this
  case though.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This has been corrected in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Place the following code in a new program file, save the code and run The
  program. The code below is from a form created in the Form Designer that was
  opened in the Class Browser. Note the PROCEDURE Activate.

        ***Start of program code
        PUBLIC oform1

        oform1=CREATEOBJECT("form1")
        oform1.Show
        RETURN

        **************************************************
        *-- Form:         form1 (d:\dchou\test\test.scx)
        *-- ParentClass:  form
        *-- BaseClass:    form
        *
        DEFINE CLASS form1 AS form

           ShowWindow = 2
           DoCreate = .T.
           AutoCenter = .T.
           Caption = "Form1"
           Name = "Form1"

           PROCEDURE Activate
              WAIT WINDOW "Some Message" NOWAIT
              Thisform.Release
           ENDPROC

        ENDDEFINE
        *
        *-- EndDefine: form1
        **************************************************

2. Click the form or WAIT WINDOW. There should be no response.

3. Click the Windows Taskbar button for Visual FoxPro. The Top-Level form should
  disappear behind Visual FoxPro. Click the Windows Taskbar button for the
  Top-Level form; it should be labeled Form1. The border and title bar of the
  form may sometimes reappear. If the form appears, it will look transparent.
