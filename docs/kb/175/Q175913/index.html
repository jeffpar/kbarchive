IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

After you change the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) scope on your
Microsoft Windows NT DHCP Server, your DHCP clients may continue to lease
addresses from the original or old scope. This may occur even if the old scope
information is non-existent in DHCP Admin.

NOTE: Stopping and restarting the DHCP Server Service or restarting the DHCP
Server has no effect on this issue and attempts to release or renew the address
on the client has no effect.

CAUSE
=====

A registry key with the old DHCP scope information on the DHCP Server still
exists.

RESOLUTION
==========

You will need to remove the registry key that references the old scope range by
performing the following steps:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), and go to the following subkey:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
     \DHCPServer\Configuration\Subnets\&lt;Subnet ID&gt;
     \IpRanges\&lt;Old scope range&gt;

  NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

2. Click &lt;Old scope range&gt;, click Delete from the Edit menu, and click Yes
  in the Warning dialog box.

It is not necessary to restart the DHCP Server. After this key is deleted, DHCP
clients will obtain IP addresses from the new scope range.
