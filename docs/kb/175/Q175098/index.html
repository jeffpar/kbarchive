-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are installing Exchange Server version 5.5 or upgrading to Exchange
Server version 5.5, the process may fail and the following three error messages
may appear:

  An unexpected error occurred in the upgrade process.
  Microsoft Exchange Server Setup
  ID no: c1032c00

-and-

  ERROR: Your upgrade did not complete successfully. Please restart your
  Microsoft Exchange services and your system will behave as it did before
  the upgrade was attempted.
  Please contact Microsoft Product Support Services for more information.
  Microsoft Exchange Server Setup
  ID No: c1032c08

-and-

  A fatal error has occurred. Check that you have sufficient memory and
  disk space available.

CAUSE
=====

These error messages may appear during the upgrade or the installation process
if there are insufficient system resources, such as low memory, or insufficient
hard disk space available to perform the upgrade. Corruption in the database
also may cause the upgrade process to fail.

RESOLUTION
==========

If failure is due to insufficient system resources, freeing disk space or adding
additional hardware should correct the situation. Freeing memory by closing any
running applications or unnecessary services may also allow the upgrade to
complete.

If failure is due to corruption in the database (.edb) files, the store files
will have to be repaired using the ESEUTIL program before the upgrade or
installation to version 5.5 can take place. For more information on using the
ESEUTIL program, consult the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator's Guide, or
see Knowledge Base article Q182903, "XADM: ESEUTIL Command Line Parameters."

If you chose the Fault Tolerant method during the upgrade process, restarting the
services should be the only recovery method needed to continue using the
previous version of Exchange Server. This is because the Fault Tolerant
installation method copies the database files to a backup directory before
beginning the conversion process to Jet97.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The error messages may be somewhat confusing because all three error messages
appear regardless of the cause of the upgrade failure. The first two errors may
apply to any problem during a failed upgrade, but the third error message
appears even though it has no reflection on the database being corrupted.
