The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Control Creation Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you embed a licensed ActiveX control inside a Visual Basic ActiveX control
and then attempt to use it on another machine, the Visual Basic ActiveX control
can fail to instantiate.

CAUSE
=====

By default, Visual Basic ActiveX controls do not support embedding licensed
controls.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two possible solutions:

1. If you make the outer Visual Basic control licensed, embedded licensed
  controls will be created successfully. You can turn on licensing by selecting
  Project/&lt;ProjectName&gt; Properties, clicking the General tab and checking
  "Require License Key."

  -or-

2. For a licensed control to support being instantiated in a Visual Basic
  control, it needs to support the following interface GUID:

  {0x6e6e9780, 0x165d, 0x11d0, {0xb3, 0xe6, 0x00, 0xa0, 0xc9, 0x0f, 0x27,
  0x31}}

Visual Basic will call QueryInterface() on the embedded licensed control's
IClassFactory for the GUID above. If the embedded control's IClassFactory
::QueryInterface function returns S_OK and a pointer to the IUnknown interface,
Visual Basic will create the licensed control using the cached license key.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the outer Visual Basic control is converted to a licensed control, and if the
client/container creates the outer Visual Basic control dynamically (via a
function call), as opposed to inserting it into a dialog, a license key will
have to be passed to the function. Hosting licensed ActiveX controls in Internet
Explorer will also require a license key. See the REFERENCES section of this
article for more information.

When you use a licensed control in a non-ActiveX Control project, Visual Basic
caches the control's run-time license key as part of the compiled program. When
you run the program on a machine that doesn't have a design- time license,
Visual Basic will use the stored license key to instantiate the licensed
control.

Licensed controls that come with Visual Basic that cannot be used inside a
UserControl include Crystal(crystl32.ocx)and DBGrid(dbgrid32.ocx).

The common controls in COMCTL32.OCX are licensed but were written so you can use
them in a Visual Basic ActiveX control.
