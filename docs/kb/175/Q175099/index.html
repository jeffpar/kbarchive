-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
- Microsoft Outlook, Exchange Server Edition, version 8.0, used with:
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When using the ShivaRemote client software to establish a connection through a
Remote Access Service (RAS) server to an Exchange Server computer, you may
receive the following error message:

  Unable to negotiate LCP connection. Please check that
  remote device is installed and configured and that
  dial-in is enabled

CAUSE
=====

The RAS server is a computer running Windows NT 4.0. If your RAS server is
configured to "Allow any authentication including clear text," a RAS client is
able to connect with Password Authentication Protocol (PAP), Shiva Password
Authentication Protocol (SPAP), Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol
(CHAP), or Microsoft CHAP (MS- CHAP) depending on what the client supports.
Normally, a client will attempt to connect with CHAP or MS-CHAP, if that is
valid for the RAS server to which it is connecting. In the case of Shiva remote
client connections, Shiva does not support MS-CHAP. Encountering this protocol
causes the Shiva client to fail.

For additional information about Windows NT 4.0 RAS server authentication
configuration, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q172216 How to Force Routing and Remote Access to Use PAP

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around the problem:

- Set the Windows NT 4.0 RAS server to use NetBEUI as the only protocol. This
  will allow the Exchange connection to work successfully. However, the NetBEUI
  protocol has limitations that others do not.

  -or-

- Upgrade the client to Windows 95 and use dial-up networking to configure a
  remote connection.

  -or-

- Downgrade the RAS server to Windows NT version 3.51 with the latest service
  pack. Shiva can successfully negotiate connections through Windows NT 3.51
  RAS servers using any protocol.
