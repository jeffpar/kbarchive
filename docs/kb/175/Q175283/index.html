SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to run Performance Optimizer in silent mode or batch
mode, which allows it to run without interaction from the user.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Follow these steps to run Performance Optimizer (PerfWiz) in silent mode:

1. Create a text file named Perfopt.inf in the same folder as the Perfwiz.exe
  file. See the "Creating the INF File" section of this article.

2. Run PerfWiz with the -s option. PerfWiz runs silently and finishes without
  any user intervention. The log file is still written in the usual place.

3. Run PerfWiz with the -f &lt;inf file&gt; option. PerfWiz runs silently and
  finishes without any user intervention. The log file is still written in the
  usual place. The &lt;inf file&gt; can be any arbitrary file that conforms to
  the same format as the Perfopt.inf file (see the "Creating the INF File"
  section of this article).


Creating the INF File
---------------------

The format of the INF file should read as follows. Be careful to take note of the
spacing between words.

     [Perfwiz]
     Users=[0|1|2|3|4|5]
     Org Users=[0|1|2|3|4]
     Server Type=number (see below)
     Dont Restart=[0|1]
     Analyze Disks=[0|1]
     Move Files=[0|1]
     Limit Memory Usage=number of megabytes

Here is a description of each of the keys above:

Users - Corresponds to the "Number of users you will host on this server"
question.

  Value Meaning
    0   Less than 500
    1   500 - 999
    2   1,000 - 4,999
    3   5,000 - 24,999
    4   25,000 - 49,000
    5   50,000 or more

Default is set to 0 for Users.

Org Users - Corresponds to the "Number of users in your organization" question.

  Value Meaning
     0  Less than 1,000
     1  1,000 - 9,999
     2  10,000 - 99,999
     3  100,000 - 499,999
     4  500,000 or more

Default is set to 0 for Org Users.

Server Type - Corresponds to the "What type of server will this computer be
configured to be" question. The value can be any combination (by addition) of
the following values (for example, if the server will serve a Private, Public,
and Connector role, the value will be 1 + 2 + 4, which will be 7).

  Value Meaning
  Nothing Selected  = 0
  Public  = 1
  Private  = 2
  Private,Public = 3
  Connector/Directory Import = 4
  Connector/Directory Import,Public = 5
  Connector/Directory Import,Private= 6
  Connector/Directory Import,Private,Public= 7
  Multi-server = 8
  Public,Multi-server = 9
  Private,Multi-server = 10
  Private,Public,Multi-server = 11
  Connector/Directory Import,Multi-server = 12
  Public,Multi-server,Connector/Directory Import = 13
  Private,Multi-server,Connector/Directory Import = 14
  Private,Public,Multi-server,Connector/Directory Import = 15
  POP3 = 16

Default is set to Private Server.

NOTE: If POP3 is set, Private Server is also set; Public Server and Connector are
cleared.

The following keys can have the value FALSE (No) or TRUE (Yes) respectively.

Dont Restart - Don't restart the services after running the optimizer. This is
highly recommended to be FALSE if running in silent mode. Default is set to
FALSE.

Analyze Disks - TRUE if the disks should be analyzed by the optimizer. Set this
to FALSE if you are sure the various Exchange Server files reside in their ideal
locations. Default is set to TRUE.

Move Files - TRUE if files should be moved after disk analysis has determined
that they need to be moved. This is ignored if Analyze Disks is set to FALSE.
This is highly recommended to be TRUE if Analyze Disks is TRUE when running in
silent mode. Default is set to TRUE.

You can use either of the following two command lines to run PerfWiz
successfully:

  Perfwiz -s

  -or-

  Perfwiz -f c:\exchsrvr\bin\perfopt.inf

Run either at the command line in the root of the Exchsrvr\Bin folder. Make sure
the Perfopt.inf file is stored at this root as well.

Limit Memory Usage - If you remove the Limit Memory Usage line from the INF file,
it removes the option to limit memory.
