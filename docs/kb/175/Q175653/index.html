IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the
"Restoring a Registry Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOM

When you start Windows NT, you may receive the following error message:

  At least one service or driver failed during system startup. Use Event Viewer
  to examine the event log for details.

When this occurs, you may see the following error message in the system
log in Event Viewer

  Could not start &lt;service name&gt; service on \\&lt;computer name&gt;
  Error 0005: Access is Denied

where &lt;service name&gt; is the name of the service you are
attempting to start, and &lt;computer name&gt; is the name of your
computer.

The following error message may also appear in system log:

  Event ID: 7000
  Source: Service Control Manager
  Description: &lt;service name&gt; service failed to start due to the
  following error: The system cannot find the file specified.

CAUSE
=====

These error messages can occur if the ImagePath string value has a data value
that contains a long file name with spaces in the following registry key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\&lt;service name&gt;

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To resolve this error message, change the ImagePath string value by typing
quotation marks (") around the data value in the following registry key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\&lt;service name&gt;
