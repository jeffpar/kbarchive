SUMMARY
=======

The purpose of this paper is to help customers decide which Visual Basic data
access interface makes sense now, and in the future for any given application.
This paper is split into two parts to address these issues separately. It is
clear that there are plenty of "right" solutions from which to choose. The real
question is, which does the job today and best positions your team and
application for what is coming in the future? Developers find it especially
difficult to work with future solutions that don't meet today's real problems.
Fortunately, Visual Basic developers do not have to take that course when
deciding among today's solutions.
