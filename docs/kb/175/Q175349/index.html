MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

Page xii: Web Site Change

marks)

If you are using a newer browser, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 or
later, you should automatically be pulled from the old address to the new Web
site within a few seconds. If you are using an older browser, you may wish to
consider an upgrade to the latest Microsoft Internet Explorer. For more
information, please check the following Web site:

Page 5: Typographical Error
---------------------------

Page 5, section HKEY_CURRENT_USER, sentence 1:
Close up space in third line: "HKEY_USERS\name, w here..."


Page 12: INI File Value Does Not Always Override Registry
---------------------------------------------------------

Page 12, paragraph 2, sentence 3:
Change: "...the value from the INI file is copied over the Registry value."
To: "...the value from the INI file is sometimes copied over the Registry value."
(without the quotation marks)


Page 23: Save Mode Should Be Safe Mode
--------------------------------------

Page 23, paragraph 1, sentence 1:
Change: "...you can restart the computer in Save mode."
To: "...you can restart the computer in Safe mode." (without the quotation
marks)

Note that the .DA0 files will only be used to restore the Registry if the
Registry is corrupted. You can take the following steps to restore a key if you
have accidentally deleted or changed a Registry key and don't have a backup of
the old Registry:

1. Immediately exit Windows 95.

2. Reboot the computer (with a floppy disk) in DOS mode.

3. Copy the .DAO files over the Registry .DAT files, using the procedure given
  on page 35.


Page 34: System.dat and User.dat Attributes Must Be Changed
-----------------------------------------------------------

Page 34, after paragraph 2:
Add the following after "REGEDIT /L:C:\Windows\ ..."

  " "System.dat and User.dat are system-protected files. To use Regedit from
  the command line, you must first use the attrib command to change the
  attributes on these files:

  attrib -s -h system.dat
  attrib -s -h user.dat"

  " (without the quotation marks)


Page 37: Additional Info On Startup Disk
----------------------------------------

Page 37, paragraph 1, sentence 3:
Change: "This disk contains a mini-DOS operating system (including ATTRIB.EXE) as
well as copies of the system files (AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, SYSTEM.DAT, and
USER.DAT). You will also find a copy of REGEDIT.EXE on this startup disk."
To: "This disk contains a mini-DOS operating system (including ATTRIB.EXE). You
will also find a copy of REGEDIT.EXE on this startup disk. If there is enough
room on the floppy disk, you can also manually copy the system files
(AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, SYSTEM.DAT, and USER.DAT) to the disk." (without the
quotation marks)


Page 188: [DefaultInstall] Can't Have Two CopyFiles Lines
---------------------------------------------------------

Page 188, code listing, line 22:
Change:

  [DefaultInstall]
  CopyFiles = Explore.CopyFiles.Inf
  CopyFiles = Explore.CopyFiles.Bat
  ...

To:

  " [DefaultInstall]
  CopyFiles = Explore.CopyFiles.Inf, Explore.CopyFiles.Bat" (without the
  quotation marks)


Page 220: Path Value Must Match Default Value Of Key
----------------------------------------------------

The text states that an application can define the "Path" value for DLL files
used. However, on some installations of Microsoft Windows 95, the Path value can
be set only to the value defined in the "Default" value of this key.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.


Page 307: INF Files Will Not Remove PNF Files
---------------------------------------------

Windows NT 4.0 creates temporary files called .PNF files during the execution of
an .INF file. The .INF file beginning on page 307 does not remove the .PNF files
when it finishes executing.

The author has prepared a sample .INF file that resolves this problem. To
download this file, please visit the following World Wide Web site:
