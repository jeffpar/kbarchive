SUMMARY
=======

Citrix WinFrame is a multi-user Windows application server based on Windows NT
3.51 under license from Microsoft which supports enterprise application
deployment using a thin client architecture. This network-centric approach
includes Citrix ICA-based universal client software that works in conjunction
with WinFrame application server software. Thin client architecture provides the
high-performance and universal application access needed by users while the
application server offers I/S professionals the economic benefits of
single-point administration.

ICA (Independent Computing Architecture) is a general-purpose presentation
services protocol for Microsoft Windows, which allows an application's user
interface to execute with minimal resource consumption on a client device, while
the application logic executes on ICA-servers. With the appropriate ICA client
software, users can access standard 16- and 32-bit Windows applications running
on a remote ICA-based server by launching them from Web-based HTML pages or from
Windows desktops over dial-up, LAN, WAN, or Internet connections.

Both Microsoft Exchange Server and Microsoft Exchange Client can be run on a
Citrix WinFrame server. In a standard configuration, Exchange Server is
installed and runs as a service on primary domain controller (PDC), which can be
a WinFrame server or a computer running Microsoft Windows NT 4.0. The Exchange
Client is installed on all other WinFrame servers. Users connect to the WinFrame
servers and run Exchange Client, which then accesses Exchange Server.

Software requirements for running Exchange Server and Exchange Client on a
WinFrame server are:

- Winframe Version 1.6 with Service Pack 5 or WinFrame version 1.7

- Microsoft Exchange Server and Client version 5.0
