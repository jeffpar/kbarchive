SUMMARY
=======

If you use Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 and want to run IMAP clients against an
Exchange Server computer, you need to be aware that not all IMAP clients are
alike.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 is IMAP4 Rev 1 compliant, which is covered by RFC
2060. IMAP comprises over 30 commands, through which messages can be searched,
fetched, and expunged from the Exchange Server computer. IMAP is well suited for
online and offline use. IMAP can connect to multiple mailboxes (providing
permissions are in place) and public folders, and can be used for non email
purposes, such as news services.

IMAP is powerful and flexible. Microsoft and the many other makers of IMAP
clients showcase IMAP functionality in different ways. For example, some clients
do not have a folder view and some do. Some clients show all folders associated
with the mailbox account and others require the user to subscribe to them. Users
that run multiple IMAP clients may not find consistent results across every
client they use. As a result, users and administrators may look to the Exchange
Server computer as the source of some IMAP client problems.

Microsoft has tested over a dozen IMAP clients since it committed to IMAP
protocol support for Exchange Server 5.5, and testing continues. When Microsoft
sees client behavior that may be interpreted as server trouble, that information
is posted in the Microsoft Knowledge Base. A number of articles already exist,
and more will be added as the product matures.

Exchange Server 5.5 is IMAP neutral, and it accepts and responds to IMAP commands
assembled by the client. Though the clients use a common framework (RFC 2060),
not all clients work the same. When performance questions arise, administrators
can activate detailed IMAP protocol logging, and they can view the IMAP
conversation.
