SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Client Services for NetWare (CSNW) or Gateway Services for NetWare
(GSNW) to connect to a NetWare server and you are running a logon script or
manually invoking a 16-bit application on a NetWare server, you may receive the
following error when you attempt to log back on:

  NetWare Authentication Failure

  You cannot be authenticated on &lt;NetWare Tree and Context&gt; due to the
  following reason: A connection to the server could not be made because
  the limit on the number of concurrent connections for this account has
  been reached.

  Do you want to select another preferred server or context?

CAUSE
=====

The NetWare server has Limit Concurrent Connections for your user account set to
1. When the client logs off after running the 16-bit application, the connection
on the NetWare server is not closed. This results in an unlicensed connection on
the NetWare server. The connections are cleaned up if the user shuts down and
restarts the server before logging back on.

NOTE: You can determine if a connection is unlicensed by going to the NetWare
server, loading monitor, and then selecting the active connection list.
Unlicensed connections will have an asterisk (*) in front of the user name.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can work around this problem by performing any of the following:

- Set the concurrent connections for your user account to a higher value on the
  NetWare server.

  -or-

- Shut down and restart the workstation after each use.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
