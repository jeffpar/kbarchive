SUMMARY
=======

There are two types of pens used in the Windows for Pen operating system:
tethered, and untethered. They act similarly in every respect; the only
difference is that one is attached to the machine and the other is tethered by a
small cable.

Pen input devices must have an installable device driver, similar to a mouse
driver, in the SYSTEM.INI file to communicate with the system. There are several
distinct differences between mouse and pen drivers:

- Pen drivers must report x,y coordinate location information at much higher
  resolutions than mice. Pens must record at least 120 events per second and
  have a resolution of at least 200 spots per inch. Pen data is reported to the
  Pen device driver (PENWIN.DLL) at .0001 inch resolution. Though this
  resolution is not fully used at this time, it allows for subsequent
  improvements in pen hardware.

- Pen drivers may also report pressure, angle of rotation, or other pen state
  information.

- Pen drivers use a private interface to manage the high data rate, thus
  avoiding a large amount of useless information.

In addition to the differences above, some pen device drivers have a feature
known as proximity sensing. This detects the x,y coordinate of the pen without
actually touching the tablet or screen.

Working in conjunction with the Pen device driver, Windows for Pen also uses a
special display driver that communicates with the Pen device driver. This is
required to allow a close interaction between the use of the pen and the display
of electronic ink on the screen.
