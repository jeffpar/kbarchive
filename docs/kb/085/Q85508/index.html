-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM), versions 6.0, 6.0a, 6.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM) version 6.0 does not support transfer of
control between 16-bit and 32-bit code segments through the INVOKE command. If
the assembler encounters an INVOKE in a 16-bit segment, it assumes that the
procedure being invoked is also in a 16-bit segment and places the parameters on
the stack using WORDs. On the other hand, if the assembler encounters an INVOKE
in a 32-bit code segment, the parameters are placed on the stack as DWORDs with
the assumption that the called routine will also be in a 32-bit code segment.
MASM does not generate warnings when the segment being called does not match the
calling segment.

CAUSE
=====

The INVOKE command, introduced in MASM 6.0, is not designed to support
transferring control between 16-bit and 32-bit code segments.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can work around this problem by pushing the necessary parameters on the
stack and making the appropriate call instead of using INVOKE.

STATUS
======

This feature is under review and will be considered for inclusion in a future
release.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is important to note that, in order to run code in 32-bit segments, the
operating system that your program is running on must be able to support 32-bit
code segments. Most PC-based operating systems such as MS-DOS version 5.0,
Windows version 3.0, and OS/2 versions 1.x do not provide support for 32-bit
code segments. Newer operating systems and MS-DOS extender packages may provide
this support.

Sample Code
-----------

  ; Assemble options needed: none
  ; Note that this code does not work on present operating systems such
  ; as MS-DOS. This code is only provided to demonstrate how to replace
  ; an INVOKE statement with the appropriate push and call sequence.

  .MODEL small, pascal
  .386

  func PROTO FAR32 arg1:BYTE, arg2:WORD, arg3:DWORD

  .code
    .startup
    MOV dl, x
    MOV cx, y
    MOV ebx, z
    INVOKE func, dl, cx, ebx ; This doesn't work.

    ;MOV al, dl    ; Uncomment this code to set up the call to func.
    ;PUSH eax      ; Push DWORD instead of WORD.
    ;MOV ax, cx
    ;PUSH eax      ; Push DWORD instead of WORD.
    ;PUSH ebx
    ;CALL FAR32 PTR func

    .EXIT 0

  .DATA
