-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run PSP.EXE version 3.1 or earlier under Microsoft Windows version 3.1,
your system may stop responding (hang or lock up). MS-DOS programs lock up and
you are unable to return to Windows. Windows or Windows applications may
suddenly fail without an error message.

CAUSE
=====

The problem is caused by another person on the network sending a print job to
the non-dedicated print server running PSP.EXE. When the print job is captured
by PSPrint, the user's machine hangs. The computer locks almost immediately when
going to the MS-DOS command prompt or within a few commands after starting the
MS-DOS session through Microsoft Windows when PSPrint is loaded before starting
Windows.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, disable PSP.EXE before starting Microsoft Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

PSP.EXE is a terminate-and-stay-resident program (TSR) commonly loaded in the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file or through a network batch file to support printing on a
non-dedicated print server. PSPrint is a network non-dedicated printer driver
that is run only on the computer that is physically attached to a shared
printer. Users that send print jobs to the non-dedicated print server use the
companion program QSLIM.EXE.

PSPrint is manufactured by Brightwork Development. They are aware of an
incompatibility problem with Microsoft Windows version 3.1 and are working on
correcting the problem.
