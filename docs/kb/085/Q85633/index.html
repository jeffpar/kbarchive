SUMMARY
=======

SplitWin.exe is a sample in the Microsoft Download Center that demonstrates how
to split a window into two panes using the mouse or keyboard. Each pane can be
scrolled independently in the vertical direction. Scrolling the lower child
horizontally, however, causes the upper child to scroll by the same amount.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  SplitWin.exe

The SPLITWIN sample creates a frame window that has a child window. The child
window fills the client area of the frame window. When the user splits the
window, SPLITWIN creates a second child window. The two child windows are sized
according to the position of the split bar.

The user can change the position of the split bar using either the mouse or the
arrow keys. After the window is split, it can be restored to its original state
by dragging the split bar off the frame window or by selecting a position that
does not provide enough room to create the second window.

When the user clicks the mouse button in the split bar, SPLITWIN starts a
PeekMessage() loop that processes mouse and keyboard messages. The PatBlt()
function updates the position of the split bar as it is dragged.
