SUMMARY
=======

If you are running Microsoft Windows version 3.1 and the File menu is missing,
or an option normally available under a Program Manager menu is unavailable
(dimmed) or missing, then either the PROGMAN.INI file or selected group files
(.GRP) have been modified.

For more information on modifying the PROGMAN.INI file, refer to pages 219- 221
in the "Microsoft Windows Resource Kit" manual for version 3.1.

The following is a list of disabled options and the procedure used to disable
them. These changes are normally made by the system administrator of the network
to have more control of the Windows environment.
