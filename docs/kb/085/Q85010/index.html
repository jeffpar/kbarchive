SUMMARY
=======

The Windows Multiple Document Interface (MDI) provides a way to standardize the
user interface of applications that can process more than one "document"
simultaneously. Applications that use MDI automatically benefit from
improvements in the MDI user interface code within Windows.

The MDI under Windows version 3.1 introduces a number of significant enhancements
to the features provided by Windows version 3.0, and it also removes a number of
problems. When an application that is designed to use MDI under Windows 3.0 is
run on a system equipped with Windows 3.1, the application automatically
receives the benefit of many of these enhancements. In addition, an application
targeted specifically for Windows 3.1 can use additional new MDI features.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows 3.1 MDI corrects a number of problems found in the Windows 3.0 MDI.
For a list of problems in Windows 3.0 that have been corrected in Windows 3.1,
query on the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  buglist3.00 and fixlist3.10 and mdi

The query above provides a list of articles describing the problems with MDI
under Windows 3.0; the list also describes methods to work around these
problems. Even though an application is no longer required to work around these
problems, the methods suggested in each article are compatible with MDI under
Windows 3.1.

The "Double-Click" Controversy Finally Comes to a Close
-------------------------------------------------------

Under Windows 3.0, when the user double-clicks the mouse on the system menu
bitmap of a maximized MDI child window, the child window does not close. This
behavior caused many complaints when MDI was incorporated into Windows 3.0. A
controversy arose regarding this behavior: some believed it to be a design
choice; others saw it as a problem with the software.

The design has been changed under Windows 3.1. Using the mouse to double-click
the system menu bitmap of a maximized MDI child window closes the child window.
The new behavior removes an inconsistency among applications that use the MDI
functions built into Windows and two applications that perform their own MDI
processing: Microsoft Word for Windows and Microsoft Excel for Windows.

A Difference with Scroll Bars on MDI Children
---------------------------------------------

Under Windows 3.0, if an application specifies WS_HSCROLL and WS_VSCROLL in the
style field of an MDICREATESTRUCT data structure and creates an MDI child
window, the scroll bars do not appear. Windows automatically sets the scroll
range to zero when it creates the scroll bars. The application must call the
SetScrollRange function to specify a positive, non-zero, upper bound for the
scroll range to make the scroll bars appear.

Under Windows 3.1, the application behaves somewhat differently. Because Windows
3.1 does not reset the scroll range to zero, the scroll bars appear if the
application specifies the WS_HSCROLL and WS_VSCROLL styles. This change might
cause problems for an application designed under Windows 3.0 that expected the
scroll bars to be hidden until the application explicitly set the scroll range.

The CS_NOCLOSE Class Style
--------------------------

Under Windows 3.0, specifying the CS_NOCLOSE window class style does not change
the behavior of MDI child windows. This behavior has been corrected under
Windows 3.1. For example, an application specifies CS_NOCLOSE in the style field
of a WNDCLASS structure and registers a window class using that structure. If
the application creates an MDI child window using the new class, Windows will
disable the Close menu option on the child window's system menu.

However, Windows makes other changes to the MDI child's system menu that are not
correct. For more information on this problem, query on the following words in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  CS_NOCLOSE and MDI

MDI Child Windows No Longer Required to Use Standard Styles
-----------------------------------------------------------

One of the most requested enhancements to Windows MDI provided by Windows 3.1 is
the ability to create MDI child windows using any window style. If an
application specifies the MDIS_ALLCHILDSTYLES style for its MDI client window,
Windows creates the MDI child windows using only the styles specified in the
MDICREATESTRUCT data structure. Otherwise, Windows enforces the default MDI
child window styles. For example, an application that uses the
MDIS_ALLCHILDSTYLES style can create MDI child windows without maximize or
minimize buttons.

Multiple Document Interface Message Changes
-------------------------------------------

Windows 3.1 includes several enhancements to MDI system messages. The
WM_MDICASCADE and WM_MDITILE messages have been enhanced to accept a cascade
flag. If an application sends either of these messages with wParam set to
MDITILE_SKIPDISABLED, Windows does not change the position of disabled MDI child
windows.

The WM_MDITILE message accepts two additional flags in wParam: MDITILE_HORIZONTAL
and MDITILE_VERTICAL. These flags specify that the MDI child windows should be
as wide as possible or as tall as possible, respectively.

Under Windows 3.0, the WM_MDINEXT message was not accompanied by any parameters
in lParam or wParam. Under Windows 3.1, both parameters are used. The value of
wParam specifies the handle of the MDI child window receiving the message. The
lParam parameter is a Boolean value specifying whether the next or previous MDI
child window is being activated.

The WM_MDISETMENU message also has new functionality. If wParam contains the
Boolean value TRUE, the current menus are refreshed. If wParam contains the
Boolean value FALSE, the frame menu and window menu are replaced with the menus
specified in lParam.
