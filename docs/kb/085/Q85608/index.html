The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article lists common problems you may encounter while installing the
Microsoft Mail Gateway to Fax.

1. Installing the fax board.

  The fax board must be installed as indicated in the Microsoft Mail Gateway to
  Fax "Administrator's Guide." The most common problem encountered with the fax
  board is the board conflicting with another piece of hardware in the gateway
  machine. To avoid this problem, check the I/O addresses of the existing
  hardware in the gateway computer, and make sure the fax board does not
  conflict with any of these addresses.

2. Configuring the fax board software.

  The fax board software must be configured as indicated in the Microsoft Mail
  Gateway to Fax "Administrator's Guide." For example, the Intel SatisFAXtion
  software must be installed on the postoffice, and certain files must be
  copied to the gateway machine. If this is not done, the gateway will not work
  correctly.

3. Incorrect file types.

  The only allowable file types are black and white DCX and PCX files, and ASCII
  text files.

4. Microsoft Mail version 2.1a PROFILE.GLB file format.

  Because the version 2.1a profile file does not have its own editor, editing
  the PROFILE.GLB file can cause problems. Do not delete semicolons or comments
  from the file. The Printer path and Logo file parameters should be terminated
  with a backslash (\). If you encounter major problems, copy the original
  PROFILE.GLB from the install disks and modify it again.

5. Microsoft Mail version 3.0 PROFILE.GLB file format.

  In version 3.0 of the gateway, the Printer path and Logo file parameters do
  not need to be terminated with a backslash (\). You can edit the file using
  the PROFILE.EXE program; therefore, it should be relatively easy to modify.

6. Printer path.

  Entering the wrong parameters in the profile file can cause problems. Printer
  path is one of the more confusing parameters--it looks for a file called
  PPB.EXE, which should be in the mail executables directory. The path entered
  in this field should point to that file.

7. Logo file.

  This path should point to the logo file being used. This field cannot be left
  blank.

8. Unable to spool incoming faxes to printer.

  Before the fax gateway can spool items to the printer, the DISPLAY.EXE program
  must be run to create a printer driver. DISPLAY.EXE must be run from the same
  directory the fax gateway is run from.
