-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 2.03, 2.1, 2.11, 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Intel InBoard 386/AT is compatible with Microsoft Windows operating system
versions 3.0 and 3.1. The InBoard 386/AT is designed to replace a computer's
80286 processor.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following are common problems encountered when running Microsoft Windows
versions 3.0 and 3.1 on a system equipped with an Intel InBoard 386/AT:

- The ILIM386.SYS expanded-memory emulator, provided with the Intel InBoard 386
  AT product, is incompatible with Windows 3.1. You should remove all
  references to this emulator from your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files
  before installing Windows 3.1.

- The Intel InBoard 386/AT, placed in an IBM PC/AT is on the Windows 3.1
  Compatibility List as the following entry:

  IBM PC/AT/Inboard 386 AT

The IBM PC/AT is based on the 80286 processor.

Restarting your System
----------------------

The Intel Inboard 386 is designed to be used in AT-type machines instead of the
native 286 chip. Intel supplies a program, SPEED.SYS, which should allow you to
restart your system by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL when the Inboard 386/AT is
installed.

This program will not work with programs such as Windows, which hook the keyboard
interrupt, trapping some key sequences, but letting others pass through.

Expanded Memory
---------------

Intel's ICACHE.SYS and ILIM386.SYS files can cause problems with Windows. Use
SMARTDrive as a disk cache with Windows (instead of ICACHE.SYS). Use EMM386.EXE
to provide expanded memory for applications running in real mode of Windows 3.0
(instead of ILIM386.SYS).

If you us the AST EEMS Memory Board on your computer with the Intel InBoard
386/AT, you may have problems using expanded memory. The AST EEMS boards cannot
be used to backfill memory down to 256K bytes with the InBoard 386/AT. If you
try to backfill, the Inboard 386's cache will cache the EEMS paged memory, and
problems will occur. Instead, set the AST board for extended memory.

Speed-Change Keys
-----------------

The InBoard 386/AT central processing unit (CPU) speed-change keys will not work
while you are running Windows. This is because Windows traps all commands from
the keyboard. The easiest way to change CPU speeds is to create a PIF file and
run the ISPEEDAT.COM file from the PIF.

Tecmar AT150E Tape Backup
-------------------------

You cannot use the Tecmar AT150E tape backup with Windows on a system using an
Intel InBoard 386/AT. The Tecmar QT150E is incompatible with the InBoard 386.

EGA Video Display
-----------------

Using Windows with Intel's INBOARD 386 and an EGA video card and monitor can
corrupt part of the screen display (usually the lower half). If this happens,
add the EGASIZE=256 command to the INBRDAT.SYS line in the CONFIG.SYS file.

General Information
-------------------

The Intel InBoard 386/AT will provide up to three times faster performance than
the 80286. It is compatible with the IBM PC/AT, IBM 3270 AT, COMPAQ DESKPRO
286(8MHz), COMPAQ PORTABLE 286, COMPAQ PORTABLE II, Tandy 3000HL, and Tandy
3000HD. It is expandable to 1 MB or RAM with 256K chips and up to 3MB with
piggyback options. It supports the optional Intel 387 DX-16 math coprocessor.

The Intel InBoard 386 PC/XT is NOT the same as the 386/AT chip. It is designed
for computers with an 8088 processor. You can only reliably run Microsoft
Windows operating system version 3.0 in real mode on a system with an Intel
InBoard 386 PC/XT.

The Intel InBoard 386 is manufactured by Intel. We make no warranty, implied or
otherwise, regarding this product's performance or reliability.
