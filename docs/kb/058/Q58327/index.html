The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following information is contained in the Microsoft Windows 3.0 WININI.TXT
online document. The Windows Setup program copies this text file to your Windows
directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

[WINDOWS] SECTION
-----------------

The [windows] section contains settings that affect the following
parts of your Windows environment:

* Applications that start with Windows
* File extensions
* Keyboard output
* Mouse output
* Null communication port
* Printed output
* Warning beep
* Window border width

The [windows] section can contain the following settings:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Beep=&lt;yes-or-no&gt;
Default:   Yes
Purpose:   If this setting is enabled, Windows sounds a warning beep
          when you attempt to do something that is not allowed.
To change: Choose the Sound icon from the Control Panel window.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
BorderWidth=&lt;integer&gt;
Default:   3
Purpose:   Sets the width of the borders around all the windows on
          your desktop except those (such as Control Panel) that are
          fixed. The allowed range is 1 (narrowest) to 49 (widest).
To change: Choose the Desktop icon from the Control Panel window.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
CursorBlinkRate=&lt;milliseconds&gt;
Default:   530
Purpose:   Indicates how many milliseconds elapse between each time
          the cursor blinks (flashes off and on).
To change: Choose the Desktop icon from the Control Panel window.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Device=&lt;output-device-name, device-driver, port-connection&gt;
Default:   None
Purpose:   Defines the default printer. The &lt;output-device-name&gt;
          value can be any device name given in the [devices]
          section. An explicit port and driver must be assigned to
          the device. The &lt;device-driver&gt; value is the filename
          (without the extension) of the device-driver file. The
          &lt;port-connection&gt; value is any port name given in the
          [ports] section.
To change: Choose the Printers icon from the Control Panel window.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
DeviceNotSelectedTimeout=&lt;seconds&gt;
Default:   15
Purpose:   Tells Print Manager the number of seconds to wait for a
          device to be switched on. If the device is not switched on
          during this time, Print Manager won't print to the device.
          Note that for some devices, Print Manager immediately posts
          an error message if the device is not already switched on.
To change: Choose the Printers icon from the Control Panel window.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Documents=&lt;extensions&gt;
Default:   None
Purpose:   Defines which files Windows identifies as documents.
          Separate each extension name with a space, and do not
          include periods (for example, TXT).
To change: Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
DoubleClickSpeed=&lt;milliseconds&gt;
Default:   452
Purpose:   Establishes the maximum amount of time between clicks of
          the mouse button that the system will permit for one
          double-click. The lower the value, the less time the user
          has to click twice in order to effect a double-click.
To change: Choose the Mouse icon from the Control Panel window.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
KeyboardSpeed=&lt;milliseconds&gt;
Default:   31
Purpose:   Establishes how much time elapses between repetitions of a
          character on the display when you hold down a keyboard key.
To change: Choose the Keyboard icon from the Control Panel window.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Load=&lt;filename(s)&gt;
Default:   None
Purpose:   Tells Windows to load a particular application and run it
          as an icon when Windows is started. This value is a list of
          one or more application filenames, separated by commas or
          spaces.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
MouseSpeed=&lt;speed-option&gt;
Default:   1
Purpose:   Establishes the relationship between mouse movement and
          cursor movement when either the value of MouseThreshold1 or
          MouseThreshold2 is exceeded. When this occurs, Windows
          causes cursor movement to accelerate according to the
          &lt;speed-option&gt; value. If it is 0, there is no acceleration.
          If it is 1, the cursor is moved twice the normal speed when
          mouse movement exceeds the value of MouseThreshold1. If it
          is 2, the cursor is moved twice the normal speed when mouse
          movement exceeds the value of MouseThreshold1 or four times
          the normal speed if mouse movement exceeds MouseThreshold2.
To change: Choose the Mouse icon from the Control Panel window.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
MouseThreshold1=&lt;pixels&gt;
Default:   5
Purpose:   Establishes the maximum number of pixels that the mouse can
          move between mouse interrupts before Windows alters the
          relationship between mouse movement and cursor movement. If
          the mouse movement exceeds this threshold and MouseSpeed is
          greater than zero, Windows causes the cursor to move at
          twice the normal speed.
To change: Choose the Mouse icon from the Control Panel window.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
MouseThreshold2=&lt;pixels&gt;
Default:   10
Purpose:   Establishes the maximum number of pixels that the mouse can
          move between mouse interrupts before Windows alters the
          relationship between mouse movement and cursor movement. If
          the mouse movement exceeds this threshold and MouseSpeed is
          equal to 2, Windows causes the cursor to move at four times
          the normal speed.
To change: Choose the Mouse icon from the Control Panel window.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
NullPort=&lt;null-portname&gt;
Default:   None
Purpose:   Specifies the name used for a null port. This name is used
          in cases where a device is installed (that is, the device
          driver is present) but is not connected to any port.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Programs=&lt;extensions&gt;
Default:   COM EXE BAT PIF
Purpose:   Defines which files Windows regards as applications.
          Extension names are separated by a space and do not include
          periods.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Run=&lt;filename(s)&gt;
Default:   None
Purpose:   Tells Windows to load one or more specified applications
          and run them in windows when Windows is started. The value
          is a list of one or more application filenames, separated
          by commas or spaces.
To change: Use Notepad to edit the WIN.INI file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Spooler=&lt;yes-or-no&gt;
Default:   Yes
Purpose:   Specifies whether output to the printer is to be sent
          through Print Manager. The default value is "yes". Setting
          this value to "no" disables Print Manager.
To change: Choose the Printers icon from the Control Panel window.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
TransmissionRetryTimeout=&lt;seconds&gt;
Default:   45
Purpose:   Tells Print Manager the amount of time allowed for
          attempted transmission retries. If a successful
          transmission does not occur during this time, Print Manager
          posts a message box stating that the printer is not
          receiving characters.
To change: Choose the Printers icon from the Control Panel window.
