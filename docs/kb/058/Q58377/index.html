The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a

SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses some common File Manager usage problems in Microsoft
Windows 3.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When File Manager Updates Its Display
-------------------------------------

Windows File Manager's directory list window updates automatically when files are
changed, added, or deleted under the following circumstances only:

- If a Windows-based application makes the change and uses proper Windows calls
  to do so

- If an MS-DOS-based application running under Windows in 386 enhanced mode
  makes the change, and the SYSTEM.INI setting FileSysChange is set to YES (the
  default):

  FileSysChange=yes

  Files changed by MS-DOS-based applications running from Windows in real or
  standard mode will not update File Manager. To update the directory list
  display, choose Refresh from the Windows menu, or press F5.

Search Window Not Updated
-------------------------

If you move, delete, or rename a file from the File Manager Search window with
the mouse, the Search window is correctly updated. However, if you move, delete,
or rename a file by choosing Move from the File menu, the Search window isn't
updated.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows versions 3.0 and 3.0a.
This problem was corrected in Windows version 3.1.

Network Drives Not Updated
--------------------------

File Manager's active drive listing includes any network drives to which a
connection has been established prior to running Microsoft Windows.

Additional drives may be added by choosing the Connect Net Drive command from the
Disk menu. If a third-party utility is used to establish network connections,
File Manager's drive list does not update, and the drives are not available in
File Manager. The only way to update the drive list without closing and
restarting File Manager is to connect to or disconnect from a network drive
through File Manager, at which point File Manager rereads and updates the drive
list.

If a third-party utility establishes or removes network connections, connecting
or disconnecting a drive through File Manager forces File Manager to update its
drive list, which will then include all changes made by the third-party network
utility.

Note that the Refresh command on the Window menu only refreshes the directory
tree -- not the drive list. Choosing this command does not make the network
drives available.
