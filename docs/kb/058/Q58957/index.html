The ListBox function of the WINDOW.BAS toolbox file is not designed to
be used when other windows are already open. This is because ListBox
redefines Window 1 and closes all windows when it is finished
executing. This is not a problem, but a limitation of the ListBox
function.

This information applies to Microsoft BASIC Professional Development
System (PDS) Version 7.00 for MS-DOS.

This behavior of the ListBox function can be changed by modifying two
statements, the one that opens and redefines Window 1 and the one that
closes all the windows at the end of the function.

The statement that opens and redefines Window 1 is as follows:

   WindowOpen 1, 4, StartRowPos, 20, StopRowPos, 0, 7, 0, 7, _
       15, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, ""

The number mentioned immediately after "WindowOpen" (1 in this case)
is the handle to the window that will be opened. If Window 1 already
exists, it will be redefined and become the modal window that is used
by the ListBox function. This statement must be changed so that the
next available window handle is used, not always Handle 1. The
function for getting this handle is WindowNext. Therefore, the
modified WindowOpen statement would be as follows:

   WindowOpen WindowNext, 4, StartRowPos, 20, StopRowPos, 0, 7, 0, 7, _
      15, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, ""

Now when the statement is executed, the next available window handle
is used instead of always using Handle 1. This ensures that a window
that is already open will not be redefined.

The statement that closes all of the windows at the end of the
function is as follows:

   WindowClose 0

Passing a 0 to the WindowClose statement closes all open windows.
Passing any other handle closes just the window with that handle. This
statement must be changed so that only the current window (the one
being used by ListBox) is closed. The function that returns the handle
of the current window is WindowCurrent. Therefore, the above statement
should be changed to the following:

   WindowClose WindowCurrent

When the above two changes have been made to the ListBox function, it
can safely be used with other open windows.

The following sample program illustrates how to use the ListBox
function. It opens a window and then a button in that window. Then it
invokes ListBox, passing it an array of strings to display. After the
user has finished with the list, the WindowDo procedure is invoked,
which polls the mouse, waiting for the user to click on the button
opened in Window 1. When it is clicked, the program ends. However, if
the above changes have not been made to the ListBox function, Window 1
is redefined by the window opened by ListBox. Thus, the first window
opened disappears, along with its button. After ListBox is finished
executing, it closes the window that it created, leaving no windows
for the WindowDo procedure to operate on. This causes the program to
end immediately.

Code Example
