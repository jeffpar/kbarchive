The following is a complete description of the compiler options
available when you choose the Make EXE File command from the Run menu
in the QuickBASIC extended (QBX.EXE) environment. This information is
also available in the "Microsoft BASIC 7.0: Language Reference" manual
(for 7.00 and 7.10) under "appendixes," Page 608.

This information applies to Microsoft BASIC Professional Development
System (PDS) versions 7.00 and 7.10 for MS-DOS and MS OS/2.

Although the QBX.EXE editor can run only under MS-DOS or the DOS real
mode of MS OS/2, the Make EXE File command in QBX.EXE can use the /Lp
option to create programs that require MS OS/2 protected mode.

------------------------ Make EXE File -------------------
                ____________________________________
EXE File Name: |____________________________________|

This box lets you specify the name of the output .EXE file.

----- EXE Type -----------------------------------------
[] Stand-Alone EXE           /O
[] EXE Requiring BRT Module
--------------------------------------------------------

/O -- Substitutes the default stand-alone library for the default
run-time library (creates a stand-alone executable file that can run
without a BASIC run-time module). Stand-alone programs can be
significantly larger than programs compiled to use the run-time
module. /O is selected by default in this Make EXE File window.

EXE Requiring BRT Module -- Makes an EXE program that requires the
presence of BRT70XXX.EXE at run time. The XXX depends upon the /Fpi or
/Fpa math package, near or far strings, and real or protected mode.

----- Speed -------------------------------------------
[] 80x87 or Emulator Math   /Fpi
[] Alternate Math           /Fpa
[] Code Generation for 286   /G2
[] Quick Call Optimization   /Ot
-------------------------------------------------------

/Fpi -- Causes the compiler to generate "in-line instructions" for use
in floating-point operations. This option is the default.

/Fpa -- Causes your program to use the alternate-math library for
floating point operations.

/G2 -- This option generates 80286-specific instructions (which
actually affects size more than speed)

/Ot -- Optimizes execution speed for SUB and FUNCTION procedures and
DEF FN statements. To use this type of optimizing, certain conditions
must be met. The frame size generated for SUB and FUNCTION procedures,
and statements defined by DEF FN, depends on which of the following
conditions exist in your code:

   For SUB and FUNCTION procedures:

   A reduced frame is generated with /Ot if no module-level handler
   exists in the code, and the /D or /Fs isn't used. A full frame is
   generated if your code uses local error handlers, calls a DEF FN or
   GOSUB statement, has returned (because of a GOSUB or other reason),
   or contains an ON event GOSUB.

   For statements defined by DEF FN:

   A full frame is generated if the /D, /Fs, /E, or /X option is used.
   In all other cases, no frame is generated if the /W or /V option is
   used. In all other cases, no frame is generated.

---- Target Environment --------------------------------
[] DOS or OS/2 Real Mode     /Lr
[] OS/2 Protected Mode       /Lp
--------------------------------------------------------

/Lr -- Creates a real-mode object file (the default). This makes
.EXE programs that run in MS-DOS or the real mode (the DOS 3.x box)
of MS OS/2.

/Lp -- Creates a protected-mode object file (to make .EXE programs
that run in OS/2 protected mode).

---- Size/Capacity -------------------------------------
[] Far Strings                /Fs
[] Near Strings
[] Disable String Compression /S
--------------------------------------------------------

/Fs -- This option enables far-heap strings in user programs.

Near Strings -- This option enables near (DGROUP) strings in user
programs.

/S -- Writes quoted strings directly to the object file instead of the
symbol table in memory. Use this option when an "Out of memory" error
message is generated while BC.EXE is compiling a program that has many
string constants.

---- Debug ----------------------------------------------
[] Run-Time Error Checking    /D
[] CodeView Information       /Zi
---------------------------------------------------------

/D -- Generates debugging code for run-time error checking; enables
CTRL+BREAK. For ISAM programs, causes BASIC to write open database
buffers to disk after every DELETE, INSERT, UPDATE, and CLOSE
statement. You must use either /Ah or /D when you are compiling Quick
library routines that will be loaded into QBX with the /Ea option
(which moves arrays into expanded memory).

/Zi -- This option adds debugging information to the object file that
can be used by the Microsoft CodeView (CV.EXE, or CVP.EXE) debugger.

QBX.EXE 7.10 adds an "Additional Options" field (not found in 7.00),
which lets you specify any additional compiler options for invoking
BC.EXE.

There are four buttons at the bottom of the window:

Make EXE -- This button shells out to DOS, runs BC.EXE with the
specified options, runs LINK.EXE, creates an executable BASIC .EXE
program, and returns to QBX.EXE.

Make EXE and Exit -- This button transfers control to BC.EXE with the
specified options, runs LINK.EXE, creates an executable BASIC
.EXE program, and ends control in DOS, where you can run the .EXE.

Cancel -- The Cancel button removes the Make EXE File window and
returns you to the main QBX.EXE screen.

Help -- The Help button briefly describes a few features of the Make
EXE File window.
