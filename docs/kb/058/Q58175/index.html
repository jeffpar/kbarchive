Below is the list of linker stub files that come with Microsoft BASIC
Professional Development System (PDS) Version 7.00 for MS-DOS and MS
OS/2. Stub files are special object files that block the inclusion of
certain pieces of the BASIC run-time routines in the final .EXE file
at link time. Most stub files can reduce .EXE program size and memory
usage.

This list can also be found on Pages 540-541 and 610-611 of the
"Microsoft BASIC 7.0: Programmer's Guide," and on Pages 10-12 of the
"Microsoft BASIC 7.0: Getting Started" manual.

BASIC 7.00 Stub Files
---------------------

Filename              Description
--------              -----------

OVLDOS21.OBJ          DOS 2.10 support to an overlaid program. Does
                      not reduce .EXE size.

NOCGA.OBJ             Removes support for CGA graphics (SCREEN modes 1
                      and 2).

NOCOM.OBJ             Removes communications ("COM1:", "COM2:") device
                      support in two cases. LINK includes
                      communications support overhead only if you use a
                      string variable in place of the file or device
                      name, as in OPEN A$ FOR OUTPUT AS #1, or if you
                      use a string constant starting with COMn in an
                      OPEN statement.

NOEDIT.OBJ            Reduces functionality of the editor provided
                      with the INPUT and LINE INPUT statements to
                      support only ENTER and BACKSPACE keys (no HOME,
                      END, etc.).

NOEGA.OBJ             Removes support for EGA graphics (SCREEN modes
                      7, 8, 9, 10, 11).

NOEMS.OBJ             Prevents the overlay manager from using Expanded
                      Memory Specification (EMS); instead, the BASIC
                      .EXE program is forced to swap to disk.

NOEVENT.OBJ           Removes support for EVENT trapping. This stub
                      file is effective only if linked with the BASIC
                      run-time module (BRT70xxx.EXE); it has no effect
                      when linked into stand-alone executables.

NOFLTIN.OBJ           Replaces the numeric parsing code with an
                      integer-only version. If you link with
                      NOFLTIN.OBJ, all numbers used by INPUT, READ,
                      and VAL must be legal long integers.

NOGRAPH.OBJ           Removes all support for graphics statements and
                      nonzero SCREEN modes. NOGRAPH.OBJ is a superset
                      of the following stub files: NOHERC.OBJ,
                      NOOGA.OBJ, NOCGA.OBJ, NOEGA.OBJ, and NOVGA.OBJ.

NOHERC.OBJ            Removes support for Hercules graphics SCREEN 3.

NOISAM.OBJ            Removes ISAM support from the BASIC run-time
                      module (BRT70xxx.EXE) and is not useful for
                      stand-alone programs (compiled with BC /O).

NOLPT.OBJ             Removes line printer support.

NOOGA.OBJ             Removes support for Olivetti graphics (SCREEN
                      mode 4).

NOTRNEMR.LIB          Removes support for transcendental operations,
and NOTRNEMP.LIB      including: SIN, COS, TAN, ATN, LOG, SQR, EXP,
                      ^ (the exponential operator), a CIRCLE statement
                      with a start or stop value, and the DRAW
                      statement with the A or T commands.

NOVGA.OBJ             Removes support for VGA (Video Graphics Array)
                      graphics (SCREEN modes 11, 12, 13).

SMALLERR.OBJ          Reduces size of error messages displayed.

TSCNIOxx.OBJ          Removes certain features from BASIC programs to
                      produce text-only screen I/O. There are four
                      files, depending on string type and operating
                      system mode, as follows:

                         TSCNIONR.OBJ   Near string, real mode (DOS)

                         TSCNIOFR.OBJ   Far string, real mode (DOS)

                         TSCNIONP.OBJ   Near string, OS/2 protected mode

                         TSCNIOFP.OBJ   Far string, OS/2 protected mode

                      The TSCNIOxx stub files remove all support for
                      BASIC graphics modes and graphics statements,
                      except SCREEN 0. They also remove support for
                      special treatment of control characters. The
                      TSCNIOxx stub files cannot be used with any of
                      the other graphics stub files.
