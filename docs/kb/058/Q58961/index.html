When you write a program that uses a DLL that has been linked with
CRTLIB.DLL, then the program itself must also link with CRTLIB.DLL.
The diagram and text in Section 5.2 of MTDYNA.DOC explain this close
relationship in detail.

Also in MTDYNA.DOC, the table in Section 6 is very useful for
identifying which components to use for which type of output file
(.EXE or .DLL). The following is a diagram of the library
relationships in the table:

               +---------+       |                    +---------+
           /   | xLIBCyP |       |                /   | LLIBCDLL|
       single  +---------+       |            single  +---------+
+-----+/  thread                 |     +-----+/  thread
| EXE |                          |     | DLL |
+-\---+\                         |     +-----+\
  multiple                       |           multiple
    thread     +---------+       |             thread +---------+
     \      \  | LLIBCMT |       |                \   | CRTLIB  |
      \ (or)   +---------+       |                    +---------+
       \ ________________________________________________/

As long as the .EXE is independent of any DLLs, it links with either
xLIBCyP.LIB or LLIBCMT.LIB, depending on whether the .EXE is single or
multithreaded. When the .EXE uses a DLL, the .EXE links with either
xLIBCyP.LIB or CRTLIB.LIB, depending on whether the DLL is single or
multithreaded.

Additional .OBJs and .LIBs are linked for multithreaded .EXEs and for
single and multithreaded DLLs. You can find complete detailed
information about compiling and linking multithreaded programs and
dynamic link libraries in MTDYNA.DOC, which is provided on the C 5.10
disks.
