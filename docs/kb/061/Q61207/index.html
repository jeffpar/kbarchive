The following information is taken from the C Version 6.00 README.DOC
file.

Building Presentation Manager Applications in PWB
-------------------------------------------------

The Presentation Manager build options in PWB assume that functions in
your program use the _loadds attribute in the functions that require
it and that exported functions are identified with the _export
keyword.

If your program does not identify exported and/or _loadds functions in
the function header, you need to do two things to build the program
successfully under PWB. First, select the Windows Entry/Exit Codes
check box in the C Compiler Options dialog box. This is the equivalent
of specifying /Gw on the command line.

Second, make sure the exported function names in your .DEF file are
all in uppercase so that they can be found correctly at link time. You
can also build the program successfully by disabling the No Ignore
Case option in the Link Options dialog box, but this is not
recommended.

In particular, you will have the problems described here if you use
PWB to build the example programs in Charles Petzold's book
"Programming the OS/2 Presentation Manager." Programs built using the
makefiles provided in the book will run correctly, but programs built
from within PWB must follow the instructions specified above.
