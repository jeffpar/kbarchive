-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft PowerPoint for Macintosh, versions 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 
- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows, versions 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0a, 4.0c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you run an on-screen slide show in PowerPoint, you can use the pointer to
write or draw on the screen while the slide show is running.

MORE INFORMATION
================

PowerPoint 7.0
--------------

To access the Pointer Options command, run the presentation and click the right
mouse button.

To use the insertion point as a pointer, click Arrow.

To use the insertion point as a pen, click Pen.

To change the color of the pen, click Pointer Options, and click Pen Color.

To erase pen marks, click Screen, and click Erase Pen.

PowerPoint 3.x, 4.x
-------------------

To turn the pointer on or off in all versions during a slide show, press A or the
equal sign (=) on the keyboard. These keys toggle the cursor on or off.

To draw or write on a slide in PowerPoint 3.0, turn on the pointer, hold down the
mouse button until the pointer becomes a dot, then begin drawing.

To draw or write on a slide in PowerPoint 4.0, click the Freehand Annotation icon
(the pencil) in the lower-right corner of the screen, then hold down the mouse
button and draw.

The Annotation tool can be turned off permanently by editing the Powerpnt.ini
file. Under the Microsoft PowerPoint section, change the line that reads
"SlideShowToolBar=1" to "SlideShowToolBar=0" (zero). Save the changes and
restart Windows to make the changes take effect.

If you are using ONLY PowerPoint Viewer (Pptview.exe or pptvw16.exe) the
annotation continues to appear on a computer if PowerPoint is not installed on
that computer. In order to turn off the annotation permanently, you must edit
the Powerpnt.ini file as described earlier in this article. In order to have the
annotation turned off, you must copy the Powerpnt.ini file to the Windows
directory on the computer on which you run PowerPoint viewer.

Drawing Tool Color in PowerPoint 3.x, 4.x
-----------------------------------------

PowerPoint 3.0 and 4.0 enable you to draw on the screen during an on-screen
presentation. The line color of the drawings cannot be changed.

The line color is determined by the background color of your slide. For lighter
backgrounds, the line color is green. For darker backgrounds, the line color is
yellow.

Manual Information
------------------

For more information about using the drawing feature during your on-screen
presentations (also called the on-screen-annotator), see your PowerPoint
manual:
