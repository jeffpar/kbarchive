The program shown below allows a block of memory to be saved and
restored to any location in a file. This program uses DOS interrupts
to save and restore an area of memory to/from a file.

This information applies to Microsoft QuickBASIC versions 4.00, 4.00b,
and 4.50, to Microsoft BASIC Compiler versions 6.00 and 6.00b, and to
Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) version 7.00 for
MS-DOS.

This routine can be used for several purposes:

1. This routine can be used for saving and restoring an array quickly
   to a file. BASIC PDS 7.00 can do this by using STATIC arrays in a
   user-defined type, but earlier versions of BASIC don't have this
   ability.

      Note: Variable-length string arrays cannot use this method, as
      the string data is not contiguous in memory.

2. This routine can be used in place of BLOAD and BSAVE to save and
   restore graphic screen images. The advantages of this routine are
   that in EGA and VGA screen modes, all of the screen planes can be
   stored to one file as opposed to four separate files.

3. This routine can be used when debugging a program to dump an area
   of memory to a file for later viewing by a hex dump program.

The program shown below, BUFTEST.BAS, must have the support routines
for CALL INTERRUPT. To load the Quick library QB.QLB, start QuickBASIC
with the following line:

   QB /l

To load the Quick library QBX.QLB, start the QuickBASIC Extended
(QBX.EXE) environment with the following line:

   QBX /l

The following program is BUFTEST.BAS and demonstrates quickly saving
and restoring an integer array to a file:

DECLARE SUB ReadBuffer (FileName$, FileLocation&amp;, NumBytes%,_
                        Segment%, Offset%)
DECLARE SUB WriteBuffer (FileName$, FileLocation&amp;, NumBytes%,_
                         Segment%, Offset%)
' Switch the following two lines for BASIC PDS 7.00
' REM $INCLUDE: 'qbx.bi'
REM $INCLUDE: 'qb.bi'

' These two dimension lines need to be in the program for the
' Buffer subprograms. They must be dimensioned here because
' if they are dynamically created in the subprogram it could cause
' arrays and variables to move, thus invalidating the addresses
' passed to the subroutines.
DIM SHARED InRegsx AS regtypex, OutRegsx AS regtypex
DIM SHARED Filenum AS INTEGER, FileHandle AS INTEGER

' Dimension the test array to save and restore from the file
DIM a(1 TO 100) AS INTEGER

CLS

' Create and initialize an array
FOR x% = 1 TO 10
   a(x%) = x%
NEXT

' Write the array to the file
CALL WriteBuffer("Test.DAT", 10, 20, VARSEG(a(1)), VARPTR(a(1)))

' Clear the array and display that it is zeroed
ERASE a
FOR x% = 1 TO 10
   PRINT a%(x%),
NEXT

' Read the array back in and display that it has been restored
CALL ReadBuffer("Test.DAT", 10, 20, VARSEG(a(1)), VARPTR(a(1)))
FOR x% = 1 TO 10
   PRINT a%(x%),
NEXT
