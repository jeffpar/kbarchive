The detection of common aliasing practices has been improved in the
Microsoft C version 6.00 code generator. The primary difference is
that the compiler now tries to detect when the address of a variable
has been taken and then to protect against aliasing corruption of that
variable even when the /Oa option is selected. If no options are
selected that invoke the global optimizer (/Oe, /Og, /Ol), the
optimizer depends on the preprocessor marking all variables that have
had their address taken (&amp;).

With global optimization, the optimizer itself does the necessary data
flow analysis to determine if an address has been taken. This makes
/Oa safer when used in conjunction with global optimization because it
can detect addresses being taken even in the absence of the address-of
operator (&amp;).

Aliasing is defined as being when more than one expression refers to a
single memory location, as in the following example:

int x,*p,a[3];

void main(void)
{
   p=&amp;x; // Now *p and x are aliases to the same memory location.

   x=5;  // There are now two ways to assign values to that memory.
   *p=4;

   a[2]=myfunc(p);
 // Passing aliases to functions can cause problems when using /Oa.

   p=a;
 // Arrays also can be aliased; now *p and a[0] are common aliases.
}

Common aliasing problems can occur when the compiler causes one of
these aliases to be stored in a register to speed up code execution.
If both aliases subsequently are used to change the same memory
location, one may change the register value and the other the actual
in-memory value. Furthermore, when the register variable is finally
unloaded, its value will overwrite whatever changes may have been made
to memory.

There are two places where variables stored in registers can become
corrupted through aliasing problems. One place is across function
calls where functions are assumed to not corrupt the value. The other
place is by assignments through pointer variables. The following
paragraphs and table summarize the susceptibility of different types
of data to the above mentioned corruption:

Local Variables
---------------

Because of their restricted scope, local variables are assumed by the
compiler to be safe from aliasing problems. Therefore, locals are
prime candidates for register storage and if for some reason aliasing
occurs, they are prone to common aliasing problems both over function
calls and through pointer assignment.

Global Variables
----------------

Because of their extensive scope, global variables can often
accumulate multiple aliases. Therefore, the code generator causes them
to be unloaded from registers before function calls to preserve their
value. However, globals are still prone to aliasing problems through
pointer assignment with /Oa and/or /Ow.

*p
--

*p represents a pointer variable accessed primarily to change its
associated memory location. *p as a variable can be stored in a
register, and therefore, can be affected by common aliasing problems.
It is protected under default optimizations by the code generator.
Under /Ow, it is protected across function calls but not from
assignment through another pointer (for example, a *x). Under /Oa, *p
is not protected as a separate symbol at all.

Address Taken
-------------

If a variable's address has been taken, the C code generator will
protect it from common aliasing pitfalls in all but one case involving
the /Oa switch. If a local variable's address is taken and passed to a
function, the local variable's value can then be changed within the
function through an alias without protection from common aliasing
problems.

The following two further limitations apply to the above rule:

1. If global optimization is not invoked, the code generator does not
   always recognize if an address is taken without the use of the
   address-of operator (&amp;). This is only an issue for arrays because
   they are the only object whose address can be taken without the
   operator. What this means is that given - int *p,a[4]; p=&amp;a[0] is
   compatible with /Oa, but p=a is not protected.

2. The checking is done only on a procedure-by-procedure basis, so if
   the address of a global is taken outside of the current procedure,
   it won't be detected.

The following interference table summarizes the effects of the code
generator in the various circumstances described above:

   Var Type   Effect of Function Call   Effect of Assign Thru Pointer
   --------   -----------------------   -----------------------------

              /O    /Ow   /Oa           /O   /Ow   /Oa
   local       N     N     N             N    N     N
   global      Y     Y     Y             Y    N     N
   *p          Y     Y     N             Y    N     N
   addr-taken  Y     Y     N             Y    Y     Y

   N - Variable in register not protected from common aliasing problems.
   Y - Variable unloaded from registers to memory (protected).
