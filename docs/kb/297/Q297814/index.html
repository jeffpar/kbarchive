-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you select a loaded type library in the Object Browser and view the value
of a constant double variable, the Help string of the previously selected Object
Browser item is displayed instead of the variable's constant value.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Either create a new type library by using MkTypLib or MIDL, or use an
  existing type library (.tlb) file that contains a definition for a constant
  double value.

2. Verify the value by using OLE View. To do this, follow these steps:

  a. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0,
     point to Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 Tools, and then click OLE View.

  b. In the OLE Viewer, click the TypeLib Viewer button that has three red
     triangles, or click View TypeLib on the File menu. An Open dialog box
     appears.

  c. Browse to the .tlb file that you want to view and click Open.

  d. Using the viewer that you just opened, locate a declared constant double
     value in your type library. The declaration resembles the following:

  [helpstring("Value of D")] const double d = 6;

You will compare this value with the value that is displayed in the Object
Browser.

3. In Visual Basic, start a new project.

4. On the Project menu, select References, select the .tlb file that you
  selected previously, and click OK.

  NOTE: You may have to use the Browse button in the References dialog box to
  locate the type library.

5. On the View menu, select Object Browser, or press F2. The Object Browser
  loads.

6. Filter the data by selecting the appropriate library from the &lt;All
  Libraries&gt; box.

7. Find the constant double value that you located by using the OLE Viewer. The
  location of this value differs depending on the type library you are using.
  After you have located the constant double, notice that the value that is
  assigned to it is not the same value that was assigned to it in the OLE
  Viewer.

Select different values, including the constant double value. Note that when you
select the constant double value, it is always equal to the Help string of the
previously selected Object Browser item.
