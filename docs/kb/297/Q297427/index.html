SYMPTOMS
========

During link state algorithm (LSA) database replication from the primary domain
controller (PDC) to the backup domain controller (BDC), the following
information may be recorded in Event Viewer:

  Event ID 5718
  The full synchronization replication of the LSA database from the primary
  domain controller &lt;servername&gt; failed with the following error:
  The system cannot find the file specified.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Security hive has become corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, copy the Security hive from another BDC to the BDC on
which the event information is recorded:

1. Perform a parallel installation of Windows NT 4.0 on the BDC on which the
  event information is recorded.

2. On a reliable (working) BDC, update the repair folder by using the Repair
  Disk (RDISK) utility.

3. Copy the following folder from the reliable BDC to a temporary folder on the
  BDC on which the event information is recorded:

  %SystemRoot%\Repair\Security

4. Start the BDC on which the event information is recorded, by using the
  parallel Windows NT 4.0 installation.

5. In the original Windows NT 4.0 installation, rename the following folders:

  %SystemRoot%\Repair\Security
  %SystemRoot%\Repair\Security.log

6. Expand the Security folder that you created in step 3, and then copy the
  folder to the following location of the original Windows NT installation:

  %SystemRoot%\System32\Config\Security

7. Start the BDC on which the event information is recorded, in the original
  installation.

8. On the PDC, use the netdom command utility to reset the secure channel on the
  BDC. Use the following syntax

  "netdom BDC \\&lt;BDC Name&gt; /reset" (without the quotation marks)

  where &lt;BDC Name&gt; is the computer name of the BDC.
