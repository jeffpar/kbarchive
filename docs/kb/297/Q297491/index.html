SYMPTOMS
========

You try to sign in to MSN Internet Access using MSN Explorer 6.0. A dial-up
connection is established, but you get the following error message:

  "We were not able to sign you in. There may be problems with our servers, or
  problems with your Internet connection. Please try again later."

CAUSE
=====

Any of the following could cause this issue:

- Passport server issues

- Corrupted network components on your computer

- Temporary access number outages

RESOLUTION
==========

First, confirm that your dial-up connection is still active.

To confirm that your dial-up connection is active

1. Check to see that the connection icon next to the clock on your computer (in
  the "system tray" area) is still present.

2. Start Internet Explorer and try to view Web sites.

If you can view Web sites, the issue may involve Passport servers.
If you continue to experience this issue, there may be temporary issues with the
access number that you are using to connect. You may simply choose another
access number to resolve your issue.

To choose another access number

1. In upper-right corner of the Welcome screen, click Connection Settings.

2. Click Change dialing options, and then click Continue.

3. Check that dialing options are set correctly, and then click Continue.

4. If you have more than one access number selected, clear the Use box next to
  the first number, and then click Continue.
  This will force MSN Explorer to dial the next number in the list.

5. Try to sign in to MSN Explorer.

6. Repeat these steps for each local access number in the area.

If none of these numbers work, it may be an issue with the access numbers in the
area.

To try numbers from another area

1. Select Change the location you're dialing from, and then click Continue.
  Note: If this option does not appear, then click Change How to Connect to the
  Internet, click Continue, select MSN Dial Up Internet Access, and then click
  Continue.
  The Dialing options screen appears.

2. Select any of the following Dialing options screen as appropriate:
   - I need to dial a number to reach an outside line.

   - I need to dial a code to disable call waiting.

   - I do not have touch tone service.

3. Click Continue.

4. Type the area code and telephone number you are dialing from, and then click
  Continue.
  Note: If MSN Explorer has trouble finding a local access number, put a number
  with the same area code and prefix as a known local access number in this
  field.
  MSN Explorer will now dial a 1-800 number to connect to the Internet. A list
  of all access numbers in your area appears.

5. Check to make sure that only local numbers are selected, along with
  appropriate dialing properties ("1" and the area code, if appropriate).
  Note: If you do not see a local access number in this list, try changing the
  Area Code and Phone Number fields at the top of the page to approximate that
  of a known local access number (a number with the same area code and prefix).

6. Click Continue.
  This will refresh the list of access numbers in the list. You return to the
  Welcome screen; you can now sign in using new access numbers.

If you can sign in successfully with another access number, then the issue is
with the access numbers that were previously being dialed.

If you still can't sign in, you may have forgotten your password or you may be
mistyping it. Consider resetting your password.

To reset your password

1. On the Welcome screen, click the Forgot Your Password link.

2. Follow the directions to change you password, and then try to sign in again.

If you still can't surf the Web, then the issue may be with your Internet
Connection. In this case, do the following:

- Clear the Temporary Internet Files and History.

- Uninstall and reinstall network components (dial-up adapter and TCP/IP)--see
  Knowledge Base article Q294853. Note: This should only be done if you have a
  Windows CD.

If you can successfully sign in with newly changed access numbers, then the
access numbers you were previously using were temporarily unavailable. If you
still can't sign in, a Passport server issue may be causing the "Unable to Log
on to Network" error in MSN Explorer. In this case, contact Customer Service at
1-800-386-5550.
