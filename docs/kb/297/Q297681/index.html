SYMPTOMS
========

When you browse to a secure Web site, you may receive the following message:

  This security certificate was issued by a company that you have not chosen to
  trust

CAUSE
=====

The root certificate of the Certificate Authority (CA) that issued the Web
site's certificate is not in the client browser's Trusted Root Certification
Authority store. The message does not affect the establishment of a Secure
Sockets Layer (SSL) session between the client and the server.

RESOLUTION
==========

The steps below are used to install the root certificate into the client's
browser. This eliminates the security message the next time you visit the site.
Note that these steps will only work for Microsoft Internet Explorer browsers.

NOTE: The requirement to install the Certificate Authority Certificate only
exists with non-trusted CAs, such as Microsoft Certificate Server.

1. During the default installation of Certificate Server, a shared folder is
  generated to store the root certificate file. The default location of this
  folder is C:\Certconfig. In this folder, locate the root certificate file.
  The default naming standard is as follows:

  servername.domain.com_name_of_certificate_server.crt

If you cannot find the root certificate file, search your hard drives for all
files that end in .crt. Double-click each .crt file that is returned in the
search and view its details to confirm that its serial number is the same as the
serial number of the root certificate that issued your Web server certificate.

To view the serial number of your Web site's root certificate, securely browse to
your Web site (that is, use the https:// protocol) and double-click the padlock
icon in the lower right corner of your browser. Click the Certification Path tab
and double-click the top certificate. The serial number of this certificate
should match the root certificate that your search returned.

2. Export the root certificate (.crt) file to a Base64 root certificate (.cer)
  file. To do this, follow these steps:

  a. In Windows Explorer, double-click the root certificate file.

  b. Click the Details tab and select Copy to file to start the Certificate
     Manager Export Wizard.

  c. On the second screen of the wizard select Base64, and on the third screen
     provide a path and file name for the certificate.

NOTE: This is the file that you use in the sample ASP code that is provided in
this article.

  d. Click Next and then click Finish.

3. Modify line 11 of the following code to point to the Base64 root certificate
  file that you created in step 2.

  &lt;BR&gt;Root Certificate Authority Installation
  &lt;BR&gt;
  &lt;BR&gt;

  &lt;%@ LANGUAGE="VBScript"%&gt;
  &lt;%
  Set fs = CreateObject("Scripting.FileSystemObject")
  Set MyFile = fs.OpenTextFile("c:\certificates\base64.cer", 1)

  Output = ""

  Do While MyFile.AtEndOfStream &lt;&gt; true
    line = Chr(34) &amp; MyFile.ReadLine &amp; Chr(34)
    If MyFile.AtEndOfStream &lt;&gt; true then
      line = line &amp; " &amp; _" &amp; Chr(10)
    End If
    Output = Output &amp; line
  Loop

  MyFile.Close

  Set MyFile = Nothing
  Set fs = Nothing
  %&gt;

  &lt;SCRIPT language="VBSCRIPT"&gt;
  on error resume next
  Dim Str, CEnroll

  Set CEnroll = CreateObject("CEnroll.CEnroll.1")
  Str = &lt;% Response.Write Output %&gt;

  CEnroll.installPKCS7(Str)

  Set CEnroll = Nothing
  &lt;/SCRIPT&gt;
  &lt;/HEAD&gt;
  &lt;/HTML&gt;

4. Save the modified code as Rootinstall.asp to your Web site location. By
  default this is \Inetpub\Wwwroot.

5. Browse to the Rootinstall.asp file from a client browser. If your root
  certificate is not already in the store, you are prompted to install it.

6. Click OK. The certificate is automatically installed into the Trusted Root
  Store on the client browser.
