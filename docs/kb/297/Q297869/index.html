  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply post-Windows 2000 Service Pack 1 (SP1) fixes or Windows 2000
Service Pack 2 (SP2) and modify the Kerberos MaxTokenSize registry value,
various Systems Management Server (SMS) administrator issues may occur. The
following list provides examples of the types of issues you may experience:

- When you create a package from definition, you may receive the following
  error message:

  Description: Wizard internal error: invalid WBEM ExecMethod result. Please
  exit the Wizard.
  HRESULT : 0x800706BF-The remote procedure call failed and did not execute.

- When you try to create a new advertisement, you may receive the following
  error message:

  No properties are available on this object.

- When you enumerate collections, you receive a list of Collection icons, but
  the collection name may be missing. For example, you may not see the "All
  Systems" name even though the typical icon is still displayed.

- When browsing collections within the Advertisement Wizard, you may also
  receive the following error message:

  _com_error exception in MMC Admin UI!

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the value for the MaxTokenSize value for Kerberos is set
too high.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this issue, set the value of the MaxTokenSize value that is
located in the following registry key to a decimal value of less than 50,000:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\Kerberos\Parameters

NOTE: By default, the MaxTokenSize value does not exist, and it must be added
manually.
