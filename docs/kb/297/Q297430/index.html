SYMPTOMS
========

If you have used the (now discontinued) DellNet Internet service, you may have
received a notice inviting you to migrate to DellNet by MSN Internet Access.
When you installed the DellNet by MSN software, instead of creating a new MSN
Internet Access account, you may have selected your old DellNet dial-up
connection as the connection device. For this reason, you can no longer access
the Internet.

CAUSE
=====

The old DellNet connection was selected mistakenly when the DellNet by MSN
software was set up.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can create a new MSN Internet Access account through the DellNet by MSN
software.
To create a new MSN Internet Access account

1. Contact Customer Service at 1-800-386-5550 to have a new MSN Internet Access
  account created.

2. Follow the instructions in KB Article Q294853 to set up a manual dial-up
  connection in the DellNet by MSN software.

3. Sign in to the DellNet by MSN software.

4. Click Help And Settings, click My Account, and then click Delete User.

5. Click the user tile that you signed in with, and then click OK.
  A warning box will appear.

6. Click OK.
  Note: If you have other user tiles on the machine, repeat steps 3 and 4 for
  each of the tiles to delete them from your computer.

7. Exit DellNet by MSN, and then start DellNet by MSN.
  This will allow you to go through Setup again.

8. Click the DellNet by MSN using modem option, and then click Continue.
  DellNet by MSN will now dial an 800 number and connect.

9. Select Set up a new account, and then click Continue.
  Follow the directions for setting up a new DellNet by MSN Internet Access
  account.

Note: Be sure to delete the connection file you created created manually; you no
longer need this file.

To delete the manual connection file

1. Double-click the My Computer icon.

2. Double-click the Dial-up Networking icon (or for Windows ME and Windows 2000,
  click the Dial-up Networking link).

3. Right-click the dial-up connection that was created earlier and click Delete.

4. When prompted "are sure you want to delete the connection", click Yes.
