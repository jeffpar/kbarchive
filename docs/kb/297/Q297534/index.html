SYMPTOMS
========

When a program uses RPC for socket communication, it may stop working for no
apparent reason. If you quit and start the program again, it works correctly,
but may stop working again. If you check the output of the netstat -n command,
Netstat reports many open connections in a CLOSE_WAIT state with the port that
the program is using. This is a sample of the output from the netstat -n
command:

  

  Active Connections

 Proto  Local Address          Foreign Address        State
  ...
 TCP    10.0.0.1:1091          10.0.0.5:1306          CLOSE_WAIT
 TCP    10.0.0.1:1091          10.0.0.5:4001          CLOSE_WAIT
 TCP    10.0.0.1:1091          10.0.0.5:1500          CLOSE_WAIT
...

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because RPC uses a socket that is called a SyncSocket to
optimize data communication. If the Syncsocket is closed incorrectly by the
program that loaded the RPC transport, RPC enters an error loop that it cannot
return from. RPC always assumes that the SyncSocket will always be a valid
socket, and does not have any recovery mechanism to handle situations in which
another function closes the SyncSocket.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem.

later:

  Date        Time    Size     File name     Platform
  ---------------------------------------------------

  05/17/2001  04:50p  60,176   Rpcltscm.dll  Alpha

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, this hotfix requires Microsoft Windows NT 4.0
Service Pack 6a.
