SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start Microsoft Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings, the
program's "Loading" screen appears, after which the screen may turn black, and
then the Microsoft Windows desktop appears.

The pre-game cinematic sequence is not displayed as expected, and you are unable
to start the game.

When starting either version of Flight Simulator listed above, you may see the
following message:

  mmsystem006: There are no drivers installed on your system.

corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft Windows CD-ROM. To do this, follow these steps:

  press ENTER.

  NOTE: If Windows is not installed on drive C, substitute the correct drive
  letter.

3. Type "Rename C:\Windows\System\Msvideo.dll Msvideo.old" (without the
  quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

4. Extract a new copy of the Msvideo.dll file to the Windows\System folder.
