-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The OLE DB Provider for DB2 that is included with Host Integration Server (HIS)
2000 returns incorrect meta data for tables that contain more than 84 columns.
For example, the meta data for column 85 overwrites the meta data for column 1
when the OLE DB Provider returns the columns.

CAUSE
=====

Distributed Relational Database Architecture (DRDA) returns late column
descriptors in groups. Each group can have a maximum of 84 column descriptors.
If there are more than 84 columns in a table, the late column descriptors are
sent in additional groups. The OLE DB Provider for DB2 in HIS 2000 incorrectly
restarts the column count for each descriptor group that it receives. The result
is that the first column descriptor is overwritten by the 85th column
descriptor, the second column descriptor is overwritten by the 86th column
descriptor, and so forth. This repeats for each additional group of 84 column
descriptors, so that the first column descriptor is overwritten by the 169th
column descriptor.


RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 service pack that contains
this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

+---------------------------------+
| File name    | Date     | Time  | 
+---------------------------------+
| MSEIDRDA.DLL | 01/25/01 | 12:00 | 
+---------------------------------+
| MSEIDB2D.DLL | 01/25/01 | 12:00 | 
+---------------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Micrsoft Host Integration Server
2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following illustrates one example of how this problem can be reproduced:

1. Create a table in SQL Server that has more than 84 columns. The following is
  an example:

COL01 CHAR(10)
COL02 CHAR(10)
COL03 CHAR(10)
...
COL84 CHAR(10)
COL85 INT
COL86 VARCHAR(20)

2. Create a new DTS package.

3. Create a new connection for SQL Server in the DTS package.

4. Create a new connection for the AS/400 in the DTS package by using the OLE DB
  Provider for DB2.

5. Create a new Transform Data Task between (2) and (3).

- Source : Connection (2)
- Destination : Connection (3)

6. Set the property of (4):

- Select the [Source] tab and select (1) as the table.
- Select the [Destination] tab and click the [Create...] button to create a new
table on the AS/400.

NOTE: If the Default Schema of the DB2OLEDB data source differs from the current
library of the AS/400 user account, the schema name should be added to the SQL
statement manually.

The column information appears, but the metadata for columns 1 and 2 are
incorrect:

COL01 INT
COL02 VARCHAR(20)
COL03 CHAR(10)
...
COL84 CHAR(10)
COL85 INT
COL86 VARCHAR(20)
