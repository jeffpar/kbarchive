SYMPTOMS
========

If you try to open or list Webs by using the FrontPage Server Extensions running
on an Internet Information Services (IIS) computer, or you try to open a
disk-based Web, you may receive one of the following error messages:

  Server Error: Cannot open file "C:\InetPub\WWWRoot\_vti_pvt\service.lck" for
  writing.

  -or-

  Server Error: Cannot open file "C:\InetPub\WWWRoot\_vti_pvt\service.lck" for
  reading.

NOTE: If you receive this error message after transferring your Web from a
compact disc, the problem is the result of the files being marked as read-only.

  Q303255 FP2000: Error Message Saving Changes to Web: Cannot Open File
  ...\_vti_pvt\Service.lck for Writing

CAUSE
=====

The error messages described in the "Symptoms" section of this article can occur
if either of the following is true:

- The Service.lck file is corrupted.

  -or-

- There is a problem with the permissions on the Service.lck file in the Web
  you are trying to open.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use one of the following methods.

Method 1: Delete the Service.lck File
-------------------------------------

If a network connection terminates incorrectly or if FrontPage shuts down
unexpectedly, the Service.lck file can become corrupted. To correct this
problem, delete the Service.lck file. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Quit FrontPage.

2. Double-click the My Computer icon.

3. Double-click the disk drive that contains your Web server. For example,
  double-click drive C.

4. Double-click the Inetpub folder.

5. Double-click the Wwwroot folder.

6. Double-click the _vti_pvt folder.

7. Right-click the Service.lck file and click Delete on the menu that appears.

8. If you are prompted to confirm the deletion, click Yes.

Method 2: Reset the Permissions for the IIS Anonymous Account
-------------------------------------------------------------

To reset permissions for the IIS Anonymous Account, follow these steps:

1. Open Internet Services Manager. To do this, use the method appropriate to
  your situation:

   - If you have IIS 5.0:

     On the Windows Start menu, point to Programs, point to Administrative
     Tools, and then click Internet Services Manager.

   - If you have IIS 4.0:

     On the Windows Start menu, point to Programs, point to Microsoft Windows NT
     4 Option Pack, point to Microsoft Internet Information Server, and then
     click Internet Services Manager.

2. Right-click the virtual server that the web is running on (for example,
  right-click the Default Web Site), and then click Properties on the menu that
  appears.

3. Click the Directory Security tab. In the "Anonymous Access and Authentication
  Control" section, click Edit.

4. Click to clear the Allow Anonymous check box.

5. Click OK. Click Apply. Minimize Internet Services Manager.

6. Start or switch to FrontPage. Open the web and then minimize FrontPage.

7. Maximize Internet Services Manager. Click the Directory Security tab. In the
  "Anonymous Access and Authentication Control" section, click Edit.

8. Click to select the Allow Anonymous check box.

9. Click OK twice and close Internet Services Manager.

10. Switch to FrontPage. On the Tools menu, point to Security (in FrontPage
  2000) or Server (in FrontPage 2002) and then click Permissions.

11. Click the Users tab.

  In FrontPage 2000:

  Click to select the "Only registered users have browse access" check box.

  In FrontPage 2002:

  Click to select the "Valid username and password required to browse this web"
  check box.

12. Click Apply.

13. After the process executes, do either of the following:

  In FrontPage 2000:

  Click to select the "Everyone has browse access" check box. Click Apply.

  In FrontPage 2002:

  Click to clear the "Valid username and password required to browse this web"
  check box. Click Apply.

14. Click OK to close the Permissions dialog box.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Because the FrontPage permissions scheme is very specific, permissions related
problems most commonly occur if the NTFS permissions in Windows NT Explorer were
manually changed.
