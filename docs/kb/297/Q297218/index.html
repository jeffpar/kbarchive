SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW) to package a Visual Basic 6.0
application, when you click Finish button to try to create the package, you
receive the following error message:

  Error 80010108 Automation Error.
  The object invoked has disconnected from its clients

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because there is a circular dependency in the Crystal
Reports dependency file. This applies to Seagate Crystal Reports version 8.5.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Crystal Decisions Web site at
http://support.crystaldecisions.net/library/kbase/articles/c2009024.asp states:

  To resolve this error, open Crystl32.dep in Notepad or a similar text editor
  and modify the section:

  [CRPE32.DLL]
  Dest=$(WinSysPath)
  Uses1=CRPE32.DLL
  Uses2=

  So that it reads:

  ;[CRPE32.DLL]
  ;Dest=$(WinSysPath)
  ;Uses1=CRPE32.DLL
  ;Uses2=
