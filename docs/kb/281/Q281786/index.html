The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Plus! Game Pack: Cards and Puzzles, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Players voices in Go Fish may pause for 4 or 5 seconds before they finish their
sentences, for example: "Do you happen to have any............nines?"

CAUSE
=====

This behavior results from the way the program caches the sound files in
synchronization with the game.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Plus! Game Pack: Go
Fish.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After the sounds have played through once and are cached in memory, the sounds
are played without pauses during that same game.
