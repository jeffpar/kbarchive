IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

The information store may not start (even with an empty Mdbdata folder) and the
following event ID may be logged:

  Event ID: 188
  Event Type: Error
  Event Source: ESE97
  Event Category: System Parameter Settings
  Description:
  MSExchangeIS (1956) System parameter stop clean flush threshold (1962) is less
  than start clean flush threshold (3270).

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the Buffer Threshold Low Percent registry key is missing
or has an incorrect value (too high).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, make sure that the Buffer Threshold Low Percent key
exists and has a value that is equal to or less than the Buffer Threshold High
Percent value.

Exchange Performance Optimizer (Perfwiz) adds two registry keys: the Buffer
Threshold Low Percent key and the Buffer Threshold High Percent key. Both keys
may not exist; this does not cause any issues. However, if one of these keys
exists, the other key must also exist.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

These keys are located under the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Service\MsExchangeIs\ParameterSystem

The default setting for both keys is REG_DWORD: 0x3.
