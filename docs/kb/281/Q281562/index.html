-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A newly installed Systems Management Server (SMS) may not work and the
Smssetup.log that is located on the C:\Root folder may log the following error
message:

  Registering connects for ERSQL.
  Registered the types.
  Cannot get SQL connection to the SQL server.
  Checking disk space for SQL devices (SMS database).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if an incorrect SQL default network library is selected.
SMS requires named pipes as a default network library.

SMS may also not connect to Microsoft SQL Server if named pipes is either
configured to use any server names or contains a period(.) on a server alias
column that uses Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) as
connection parameters. SMS is configured to listen only on named pipes.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior:

1. Click Start, click Programs, point to Microsoft SQL Server 7.0, and then
  click "SQL 7 Client Network Utility".

2. On the General tab, click Named Pipes in the Default Network Library list.

3. If there are any aliases that uses TCP/IP as connection parameters, remove
  them.

4. Stop and start the Microsoft SQL Server service.

If any programs require TCP/IP, create a new server alias (not using the server
name or a period ".") with the TCP/IP library.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The SQL Server uses a dynamic-link library (DLL) called a Net-Library to
communicate with a particular network protocol. A matching pair of Net-Libraries
must be active on client and server computers to support the desired network
protocol (all of the SQL Server client and server Net-Libraries are installed
during SQL Server Setup). For example, to enable a client program to communicate
with a specific SQL Server across TCP/IP, the client TCP/IP Sockets Net-Library
(Dbmssocn.dll) must be configured to connect to that server on the client, and
the server TCP/IP Sockets Net-Library (Ssmsso70.dll) must be listening on the
server.

By themselves, a pair of Net-Libraries cannot support a client/server connection.
Both the client and server must also be running a protocol stack that supports
the Net-Libraries. For example, if the server TCP/IP Sockets Net-Library is
listening on the server, and the client TCP/IP Sockets Net-Library is configured
to connect to that server on the client, the client can only connect to the
server if a TCP/IP protocol stack is installed on both computers.
