-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
- Microsoft Windows 2000 Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Active Directory Connector (ADC) with Microsoft Exchange Server
5.5, a logon failure is reported every time the ADC is run. You can find the
failure in the security event log if auditing for "audit account logon events"
is enabled for "logon failure."

The security event log shows the following event:

  Event Type: Failure
  Event Source: Security
  Event Category: Account Logon
  Event ID: 677
  Date: 1/4/2001
  Time: 1:01:30 PM
  User: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
  Computer: ServerName
  Description:

  Service Ticket Request Failed:
  User Name: Administrator
  User Domain: DOMAIN.COM
  Service Name: LDAP/ExchangeSrvName.domain.com
  Ticket Options: 0x40810010
  Failure Code: 7
  Client Address: 127.0.0.1

STATUS
======

This event can be safely ignored because this version of Exchange Server is not
Kerberos-aware and does not register a Service Principal Name (SPN) with the
Active Directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The error is generated when the ADC attempts the contact the Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) service on a member server running Exchange
Server 5.5. The server running the ADC attempts to authenticate against Exchange
service by requesting a Kerberos ticket for LDAP/myexhangesrv.mydomain.com.

The Microsoft Windows 2000 Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) attempts to
resolve the Service Principal Name (SPN) to a Windows 2000 server. Exchange
Server 5.5 is not Kerberos-aware and does not register an SPN with the Active
Directory. Because an SPN that matches does not exist, the KDC returns an error
that is logged as the 677 event. The server that is running the ADC falls back
to NTLM and is able to connect to the LDAP service on the Exchange Server
computer.

Although it is possible to manually add an SPN for the LDAP server by using
SETSPN from the Resource Kit, this will cause the ADC to fail.

Manually adding an SPN will cause the 677 events to stop. However, the ADC will
no longer be able to authenticate to the LDAP service on the Exchange Server
computer. Because the SPN can be resolved to a server, the KDC will return a
Kerberos ticket for the target server (the server with the LDAP SPN registered).
The server that is running the ADC will attempt to use a Kerberos ticket to
authenticate to the Exchange service. Because Exchange 5.5 is not
Kerberos-aware, it is not able to validate the user. This occurs even if
Exchange Server 5.5 is installed on a Windows 2000 member server.
