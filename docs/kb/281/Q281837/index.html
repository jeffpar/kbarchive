SUMMARY
=======

A COM object that is hosted in a separate EXE that is marked to run as the
launching user will run in the security context of SYSTEM when it is called from
an Active Server Pages (ASP) page that is running in an in-process application
in Internet Information Server (IIS). This is because the Inetinfo process runs
in the SYSTEM context. COM objects that are running in a separate EXE that is
marked to run as the launching user get started with the security context of the
caller's process token, not the thread token. Therefore, for IIS in-process
applications, this will be the SYSTEM context.

Additionally, script authors can use a script engine's "CreateObject" method
directly to launch a COM object, bypassing ASP's built-in checks for COM objects
that are hosted out-of-process.

MORE INFORMATION
================

System administrators can take these steps to tighten security:

- Configure the IIS site or application to run in a separate process. To do
  this:

  1. Open Properties for the Web site or virtual directory application, and
     then click the Home Directory tab.

  2. Select Run in separate memory space (isolated process).

  3. Click ok.

  If you intend to call out-of-process COM objects from this application, you
  may have to configure the object's security in the Distributed COM
  Configuration Properties application (DCOMCNFG). For additional information,
  click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge
  Base:

  Q198432 PRB: Server Object Error 'ASP 0178' Instantiating COM Object

- Use DCOMCNFG to limit access to COM objects. To do this:

  1. Point to Start, click Run, and then type "DCOMCNFG" (without the quotation
     marks). Press enter.

  2. Click the Applications tab, which contains a list of the COM objects
     organized by either name or CLSID. Find the appropriate object, select it,
     and click Properties.

  3. Click the Security tab. Select Use custom access permissions. Click Edit.

  4. Remove the users who should not have access to this object. For example,
     SYSTEM, INTERACTIVE, EVERYONE, IUSR_&lt;COMPUTER NAME&gt;,
     IWAM_&lt;COMPUTER NAME&gt;. Click ok.

  5. Select Use custom launch permissions, and then click Edit. Remove the same
     users as previously.

  NOTE: regardless of the settings on the COM object, the EXE will still start,
  although COM will return an "access denied" error message, and no methods may
  be called. The EXE is started, however, and remains in memory. This is a
  behavior of COM.
