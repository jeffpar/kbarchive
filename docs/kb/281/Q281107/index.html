SYMPTOMS
========

In Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0, the following behavior may occur with
clients that are temporarily outside the site boundaries for the clients'
assigned site:

- Hardware and software inventory for these clients may be periodically deleted
  without administrator intervention.

- Resynchronization of hardware and software inventory for these clients may
  not work. One of the following status messages may be generated:

  3703 SMS Software Inventory Processor requested a resynchronization for
  resource "CLIENTNAME" because an attempt was made to update inventory
  information in the SMS site database that does not already exist.

  -or-

  2703 SMS Inventory Data Loader failed to process the delta MIF file
  "filename" and has moved it to "path".

  Possible cause: The file is corrupt or contains bad syntax.
  Solution: Review the immediately preceding status messages from this component
  for more details.

  If you ignore this problem, SMS will probably fix it and complete this
  operation later. If this error occurs repeatedly, refer to your SMS
  documentation or the Microsoft Knowledge Base for further troubleshooting
  information.

  NOTE: These messages can also occur during typical site operations and may not
  be related to the problem that is described in this article. Please read this
  article thoroughly to determine whether or not this issue applies to your
  site.

- Clients that are installed in secondary sites but are outside the site
  boundaries may not receive advertised programs.

See the "More Information" section of this article for additional details.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if a SMS client either has the Travel Mode option set or
is configured for forced sites, the client is located outside its site
boundaries, and the client reports a discovery data record (DDR) to the client's
installed site. The system resource for this client is then evaluated as not
being assigned to any valid SMS site. Discovery Data Manager later deletes the
hardware and software inventory for any client that is not assigned to at least
one site. This deletion is performed on a daily basis and is not configurable.

See the "More Information" section of this article for additional details.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q288239 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack




Additional Settings
-------------------

To configure site evaluations to keep Travel mode or forced sites clients
assigned appropriately, you need to edit the registry.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To configure site evaluations to keep Travel mode or forced sites clients
assigned appropriately, on each SMS site server on which the fix has been
applied:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate and click the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Components\SMS_DISCOVERY_DATA_MANAGER

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value.

4. In the box, type "Travel Mode Clients Filter" (without the quotation marks).

5. Click REG_DWORD for the data type, and then click OK.

6. In the Data box, type one of the following values:

   - 0x1 = Clients in SMS 2.0 Client Travel mode are not unassigned from their
     installed sites, even if the new site boundaries do not include the
     clients' currently reported subnets.

   - 0x2 = Clients that have forced sites configured are not unassigned from
     their installed sites, even if the new site boundaries do not include the
     clients' currently reported subnets.

   - 0x3 = Clients in either SMS 2.0 Client Travel mode or with forced sites
     configured are not unassigned from their installed sites, even if the new
     site boundaries do not include the clients' currently reported subnets.

7. Click OK, and then quit Registry Editor.

NOTE: If you do not configure each site server in a hierarchy with this registry
value, inconsistent assignments and the potential absence of inventory for
Travel mode or forced site clients might result. Make sure that you configure
and document each site in your hierarchy with this new item.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can configure SMS clients for Travel mode, and to prompt the user when the
client travels outside site boundaries to join another site, to remove itself
from its current site, or to stay installed in its current site. You can also
configure the client to remain in its current site without any user
intervention. This is useful in keeping the client components installed on
computers that travel outside site boundaries, and in reducing bandwidth usage
over potentially slow links.

Another available option is the use of a Forced Sites list. With this method, a
registry entry specifies the site or sites in which the client is forcibly
installed and that the client reports to, in addition to any client evaluation
of site assignment that is based on subnet location.

For additional information about the Travel mode and forced sites options, see
the Systems Management Server Resource Guide and Systems Management Server
Administrator's Guide.

Without this fix, these client-side configuration options do not change the
server logic that is used to determine site assignment. Therefore, a client
might appear to be installed in a given site, but does not have a status of
"Assigned" when the client is evaluated on the server.

When an SMS client travels outside its site boundaries, or the site boundaries of
a site are changed so that they do not include that client's subnet, Discovery
Data Manager (a component of the SMS_EXECUTIVE service that is running on the
site server) evaluates assignment based on this new information. If the client's
currently reported subnet value does not match the list of subnets in the site's
current assignment rules, the client resource record is updated to reflect that
the client is no longer assigned. Note that this behavior may be sporadic,
depending on the discovery methods that are used and the frequency of discovery.
The primary discovery method for SMS clients is heartbeat discovery, which is
configured by default to report every seven days. You may want to avoid removing
an assignment for the following reasons:

- If a Travel-mode client reports a heartbeat DDR while the client is outside
  site boundaries, the client appears unassigned from the site or sites to
  which the client normally belongs when viewed in the SMS site database.

- SMS deletes inventory for any clients that are not evaluated as assigned to
  at least one site each night between 12:00 A.M. and 5:00 A.M. (server local
  time). This inventory deletion task is performed by Discovery Data Manager
  automatically and is not configurable.

- If a client sends a partial inventory record, and the database contains no
  inventory for that client, a resynchronization request must be generated to
  request that the client send a full hardware or software inventory. The
  hardware and software inventory resynchronization mechanisms rely on site
  assignment to determine the site that the resynchronization mechanisms should
  forward resynchronization requests to. If a client is not assigned to any
  site, a resynchronization request for it does not succeed. Inventory is not
  updated until the client is evaluated as being within the boundaries of at
  least one site.

  When this behavior occurs, the following log entries are logged in the
  Dataldr.log file on the site server:

  CMachineSource::InsertMachine - attempt to update non-existent row.
  Requesting resync.

  CMachine::SendResyncCommand - could not get site assignment.

- The targeting mechanism for advertised programs at a secondary site requires
  that all targeted systems be assigned to the site. Secondary sites maintain
  system resource information in the Sms\Ddm.box\Data.col folder in the form of
  DDRs. These DDRs are, in effect, the database of system resources that are
  used by Collection Evaluator and Offer Manager for software-distribution
  purposes. Only assigned client system DDRs are forwarded to secondary sites
  by the parent site. Therefore, if a system is not assigned to a site because
  of re-evaluation by the parent site Discovery Data Manager component, the DDR
  for that system is removed from the secondary site. Clients are not able to
  receive software distributions until they are evaluated as being within the
  boundaries of at least one site.

The fix that is described in this article provides the ability to keep
Travel-mode or forced site clients assigned to their installed sites, even if
they are reported as being outside the site boundaries.

To implement this ability, a new system resource discovery record Travel Mode
attribute has been added to reflect that a client is in Travel mode or has a
forced site entry. Discovery Data Manager logic on the SMS site server has been
updated to check for this attribute and evaluate these clients as assigned to
their reported installed site.

The Travel Mode attribute can have the following values:

- 0x0 = The client is not in any form of client-configured Travel mode.

- 0x1 = The client is in SMS 2.0 Client Travel mode as indicated from the
  Reserved2 registry value, in the
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Client\Configuration\Client
  Properties key.

- 0x2 = The client has forced sites configured in the Forced Sites value in the
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\SMS\Client\Sites key.

- 0x3 = The client is in both SMS 2.0 Client Travel mode and has forced sites
  configured.

NOTE: Site control file modification to configure Travel mode for SMS clients on
a site-wide level is not supported. Clients that are in Travel mode as a result
of a site-wide setting that is imposed by the site control file are not
detected. Instead, use The Clitravl.exe tool from the SMS 2.0 SP2 Supportability
Tools bundle to configure clients for Travel mode.

This attribute is reported with normal client logon or heartbeat discovery and is
processed by Discovery Data Manager based on the following algorithm:

  If the client has any form of Travel mode set, the system resource is
  assigned to a combination of its installed sites as reported by the DDR and
  its assigned sites as evaluated by regular site-assignment rules.

Also, an additional SMS site server registry setting must be configured to
control the evaluation of system resources that report the new Travel mode
attribute when site assignment rules are changed. Site assignment rules change
when an administrator modifies the list of subnets by starting the SMS
Administrator console, and then clicking Site, clicking Site Properties, and
then clicking the Boundaries tab. Please see the "Resolution" section of this
article for details about the necessary registry configuration items.

Examples of Changed Behavior with the Fix Applied and Enabled
-------------------------------------------------------------

The following examples use a simple hierarchy of three sites: a central site
(AAA) and two child primary sites (ABC and XYZ). Four client systems are
represented (SMSClient1, SMSClient2, SMSClient3, and SMSClient4). Both site
servers have the fix installed, and both also have the Travel Mode Clients
Filter registry item configured to 0x3.

Example 1:

Site ABC has subnet boundaries of 192.168.0.0. A computer that is named
SMSClient1 originally installed the SMS Client software from this site and is in
the site boundaries, so SMSClient1 appears as assigned to site ABC. Travel mode
is set for SMSClient1 with prompting off.

- SMSClient1 travels outside the site boundaries to an unmanaged subnet,
  10.0.0.0. While SMSClient1 is in this subnet, SMSClient1 sends a heartbeat
  DDR to site ABC reporting that SMSClient1 is currently in subnet 10.0.0.0.

- Discovery Data Manager at site ABC evaluates the client and notes that it has
  Travel mode set. Therefore, Discovery Data Manager assigns the client to the
  combination of the client's installed sites, ABC, and assigned sites, null,
  which results in assignment to site ABC.

Example 2:

- Site ABC has subnet boundaries of 192.168.0.0. A computer that is named
  SMSClient2 originally installed the SMS Client software from this site and is
  in the site boundaries, so SMSClient2 appears as assigned to site ABC. Travel
  mode is set for SMSClient2 with prompting off.

- SMSClient2 travels outside the site boundaries of site ABC to a subnet,
  10.0.1.0, managed by another site: XYZ. While in this subnet, SMSClient2
  sends a heartbeat DDR to site ABC reporting that SMSClient2 is currently in
  subnet 10.0.1.0.

- Discovery Data Manager at site ABC evaluates the client and notes that it has
  Travel mode set. As a result, Discovery Data Manager assigns the client to
  the combination of the client's installed sites, ABC, and assigned sites,
  XYZ, which results in assignment to sites ABC and XYZ. Note that the client
  is not actually reporting to site XYZ, but because the client is in the site
  boundaries of XYZ, it is evaluated.

Example 3:

Site ABC has subnet boundaries of 192.168.0.0. A computer that is named
SMSClient1 originally installed the SMS Client software from this site and is in
the site boundaries, so SMSClient1 appears as assigned to site ABC. The Forced
Site registry key is populated with ABC, denoting that this client always
reports to site ABC.

- SMSClient1 travels outside the site boundaries to an unmanaged subnet,
  10.0.0.0. While in this subnet, SMSClient1 sends a heartbeat DDR to site ABC
  reporting that SMSClient1 is currently in subnet 10.0.0.0.

- Discovery Data Manager at site ABC evaluates the client and notes that it has
  Travel mode set (indicated by a value of 2 for the Travel mode discovery
  property). As a result, Discovery Data Manager assigns the client to the
  combination of the client's installed sites, ABC, and assigned sites, null,
  which results in assignment to site ABC.

Example 4:

- Site ABC has subnet boundaries of 192.168.0.0. A computer that is named
  SMSClient4 originally installed the SMS Client software from this site and is
  in the site boundaries, so SMSClient4 appears as assigned to site ABC. The
  Forced Site registry key is populated with ABC, denoting that this client
  always reports to site ABC.

- SMSClient2 travels outside the site boundaries of site ABC to a subnet,
  10.0.1.0, that is managed by another site named XYZ. While in this subnet,
  SMSClient4 sends a heartbeat DDR to site ABC reporting that SMSClient4 is
  currently in subnet 10.0.1.0.

- Discovery Data Manager at site ABC evaluates the client and notes that it has
  forced sites set (indicated by a value of 2 for the Travel mode discovery
  property). Therefore, Discovery Data Manager assigns the client to the
  combination of the client's installed sites, ABC, and assigned sites, XYZ,
  which results in assignment to sites ABC and XYZ. Note that the client is not
  necessarily reporting to site XYZ, but because the client is in the site
  boundaries of XYZ, the client is evaluated as being assigned to that site.

Example 5:

For the purposes of this example, the events in example 1 or example 2 have
already occurred.

- An administrator at site ABC adds an additional subnet to the site
  boundaries. This triggers an immediate evaluation by Discovery Data Manager
  of all of the system resources in the site database.

- Discovery Data Manager notes that the Travel mode clients filter is set.

- Based on this setting, Discovery Data Manager does not un-assign any clients
  that have reported a Travel Mode attribute, including the mask set by using
  the Travel Mode Clients Filter registry item, even if the clients are
  currently outside the list of managed subnets for site ABC (for example, the
  clients' Travel Mode property is set to 1 or 2).

Example of Disabling the New Assignment Behavior for Travel Mode Clients
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- An administrator at site ABC reconfigures the Travel Mode Clients Filter to a
  REG_DWORD data value of 0.

- Discovery Data Manager notes that the Travel Mode Clients Filter is set to 0.

- All SMS clients still report the Travel Mode property with the clients'
  regular heartbeat or logon discovery record, but because of the configuration
  change, Discovery Data Manager no longer uses the new logic to evaluate the
  records. Discovery Data Manager evaluates site assignment based strictly on
  the original site assignment rules. If the client does not report as being
  within a managed subnet boundary, the client is evaluated as not assigned.

- If a client is in a managed subnet boundary other than the client's home site
  (that is, the site in which the client was originally installed), the client
  is assigned to the site in which the client currently resides.
