SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses the accumulation of .ddr files on secondary site servers.

MORE INFORMATION
================

As more clients are discovered and assigned to a secondary site, .ddr files can
accumulate in the &lt;X&gt;:\Sms\Inboxes\Ddm.box\Data.col folder [where
&lt;X&gt; is the logical drive on which you have installed Microsoft Systems
Management Server (SMS)].

Every .ddr file represents a saved copy of the discovery data for a client
workstation that has been assigned to the site. The .ddr file names correspond
to the computer resource ID's (identification). In addition, the contents of the
.ddr files correspond to the computer properties as displayed in the SMS
Administrator console. The respective .ddr files are updated every time one of
the discovery methods configured at the site level returns a discovery record.

The accumulation of .ddr files in the &lt;X&gt;:\Sms\Inboxes\Ddm.box\Data.col
folder in a secondary site server is by design. Similar to a primary site
server, the secondary site server needs to retain a copy of the discovery
records for all computers that are assigned to the site. Since the secondary
site does not utilize a local SQL database in which to store this information,
the discovery records are stored in the Data.col directory.

When discovery records are processed at a parent site, and if the resource that
has produced the discovery record is assigned to a secondary site, the discovery
records are replicated down the hierarchy to the secondary site server as .pdr
files. The secondary site server recognizes the file extension as a .ddr that
has already been processed by the parent site. The .pdr files are then stored or
updated in the Data.col directory as .ddr files.

For further information, please refer to Chapter 17, "Site Server Core Components
Flow Charts", page 455 of the SMS 2.0 Resource Guide.
