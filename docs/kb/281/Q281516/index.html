-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server and Host Integration Server (HIS) 2000 may stop allocating new LU 6.2
(APPC) sessions after some period of continuous uptime. Currently active LU 6.2
sessions are unaffected and continue to function properly.

If you are running an APPC or CPI-C application, you may see various symptoms
depending on the design of the application you are using. Because most APPC and
CPI-C applications are designed to wait for an available LU 6.2 session, the
most common symptom is that the application stops responding (hangs) while it
waits for a session.

If the application is designed to time out if an LU 6.2 session is not available,
the underlying [MC_]ALLOCATE fails. In this case, the [MC_]ALLOCATE may fail
with the following error message:

  primary_rc = 0x0003 (AP_ALLOCATION_ERROR)
  secondary_rc = 0x00000005 (AP_ALLOCATION_FAILURE_RETRY)

A CPI-C application that times out may return the following error message:

  rc = 20 (CM_PRODUCT_SPECIFIC_ERROR)

In addition, the SNA Server may log the following event message repeatedly in the
Application Event Log when it stops allocating LU 6.2 sessions:

  Event ID: 11
  Source: SNA Server
  Description: (1178) Initialization Failure

  EXPLANATION
  This is an internal logic error in SNA Server, related to the configuration.

  SUBCODE INFORMATION
  X'1177' Operator queues are full--messages have been lost.
  X'1178' Insufficient resources for automatic session limit negotiation.

CAUSE
=====

SNA Server is not releasing an internal control block that is used for Change
Number of Sessions (CNOS) processing once CNOS is completed under very specific
circumstances. SNA Server supports a fixed number of these special control
blocks, and therefore, over time this type of control block "leak" leads to a
situation where there are no available control blocks. Once the control blocks
are exhausted, SNA Server cannot initiate CNOS processing over any APPC triplets
(Local APPC LU/Remote APPC LU/Mode) that require CNOS. In addition, the SNA
Server starts logging Event 11 messages, as described earlier.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 4.0
--------------

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
