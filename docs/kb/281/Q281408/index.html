SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Basic authentication to password protect content that is running on
multiple Web servers, users are forced to authenticate (enter credentials) when
they establish a new connection to a Web server.

CAUSE
=====

The HTTP standard for Basic authentication (RFC 2617) specifies that credentials
should not be forwarded outside the protection space of the authenticated site.
Based on these specifications, Internet Explorer does not automatically forward
Basic credentials when users establish a connection to a new Web site.

WORKAROUND
==========

NOTE: Basic authentication transmits user credentials (username and password)
across the network in an unencrypted format. For this reason, Microsoft highly
recommends that you only use Basic authentication in conjunction with some type
of encryption, such as SSL. Although RFC 2617 dictates that the Web browser
should not automatically pass credentials outside the protection space of the
authenticated site, it is possible to programmatically persist credentials by
forcing the browser to send credentials to a new server. Forwarding credentials
outside the protection space of one authenticated site can be implemented with
Microsoft Active Server Pages (ASP) and/or HTML redirects by inserting the
credentials in the Request URI (after the protocol and before the hostname) when
you use Common Internet Scheme Syntax, for example:

  http://username:password@your.website.com

The following examples illustrate how to implement forwarded credentials. To test
any of the samples, paste the sample code into a .asp or .htm file on the IIS
server.

ASP redirect using the Response.Redirect method:

  &lt;%
     Dim strNewSite, strBasicCreds
     strNewSite = "www.microsoft.com"&lt;BR/&gt;
     strBasicCreds = Request.ServerVariables("AUTH_USER") &amp; ":" &amp; _
        Request.ServerVariables("AUTH_PASSWORD")
     If Len(strBasicCreds) = 1 Then   'don't add credential delimiters 
        strBasicCreds = ""            '  if credentials aren't passed
     Else                     
        strBasicCreds = strBasicCreds &amp; "@"
     End If
     Response.Redirect "http://" &amp; strBasicCreds &amp; strNewSite
     Response.End
  %&gt;

HTML redirect generated with ASP:

  &lt;%
     Dim strNewSite, strBasicCreds
     strNewSite = "www.microsoft.com"
     strBasicCreds = Request.ServerVariables("AUTH_USER") &amp; ":" &amp; _
        Request.ServerVariables("AUTH_PASSWORD")
     If Len(strBasicCreds) = 1 Then   'don't add credential delimiters 
        strBasicCreds = ""            '  if credentials aren't passed
     Else                     
        strBasicCreds = strBasicCreds &amp; "@"
     End If
     Response.Write "&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=""refresh"" CONTENT=""2;URL=http://" &amp; _
        strBasicCreds &amp; strNewSite &amp; "/default.asp""&gt;"
  %&gt;

NOTE: The 2 contained in the META tag above indicates the number of seconds that
the browser displays the downloaded page, prior to redirecting to the new page
specified by the URL address.

HTML redirect with hard-coded Credentials:

     &lt;META HTTP-EQUIV="Refresh" CONTENT="2;URL=http://username:password@www.microsoft.com"&gt;

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, when connecting to web sites in the Internet Zone, Internet Explorer
initially attempts to contact a Web server by using Anonymous authentication. If
the anonymous user does not have permission to the Web content, and the Web
server is configured to use Basic authentication, Internet Information Server
responds to the client with a "HTTP 401 Access Denied" message, which includes
the following HTTP header:

  WWW-Authenticate: Basic

When the browser receives this HTTP header, it prompts the user for credentials,
then re-requests the same page, but this time, it includes Basic authentication
credentials provided by the user. If those credentials are authenticated
successfully, the requested page is then returned to the browser.

By including the Basic credentials in the initial GET request, Internet Explorer
stores the credentials and provide them to the server whenever the server
responds with a Basic authentication challenge in that protected space.

NOTE:When you request an URL that includes credentials, the credentials are
visible to anyone who can see the browser or view the browser's history. To
prevent credentials from being displayed in the URL window or in the browser's
history, force the browser to rerequest a document. This document is on the
target server after the browser has authenticated to the new site. To do this,
use one of the following methods:

- After the credentials are passed to the new site with the URL, use the
  meta-refresh or Response.Redirect method to rerequest the same document on
  the server, but omit the credentials from the URL in the new request.

- During the redirection to the new server, do not redirect to a specific file.
  Instead, redirect to the root of that site or to a virtual directory on the
  new site, and omit the trailing slash from the URL (for example, redirect to
  http://www.microsoft.com rather than http://www.microsoft.com/). Omitting the
  trailing slash will cause IIS to send a courtesy redirect (to ensure that the
  client requests properly formed URLs) by informing the client that it should
  rerequest the page that was initially requested, with the trailing slash
  added to the end.

Both of these methods accomplish the same task, which is to force the client to
connect to the new server without including the credentials in the URL. It is
not necessary to include the credentials after the initial connection because
Internet Explorer will cache the credentials for the new site, after it has
successfully authenticated, and provide the Basic Authentication credentials
automatically on subsequent connections to that site, while that browser
instance remains open. For additional information, click the article numbers
