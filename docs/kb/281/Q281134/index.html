MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 4: Incorrect Information About Number Of CPUs Supported
------------------------------------------------------------

On page 4, the listed number of CPUs supported by Windows 2000 Server and Windows
2000 Advanced Server is incorrect.

In the first bulleted paragraph, change:
"Windows 2000 Server supports up to two CPUs."

To:
"Windows 2000 Server supports up to four CPUs."

In the second bulleted paragraph, change:
"...and can handle up to four CPUs."

To:
"... and can handle up to eight CPUs."


Page 102: Incorrect Subnet Name Value
-------------------------------------

On page 102, in the second paragraph, the subnet name example 192.168.19.9/32 is
incorrect. The correct subnet name value should be 192.168.19.0/24.

Change:
"Subnet names are shown in the form network/bits-masks, such as 192.168.19.9/32.
Here, the network address 192.168.19.0 and network mask 255.255.255. are
combined to create the subnet name 192.168.19.9/32."

To:
"Subnet names are shown in the form network/bits-masks, such as 192.168.19.0/24.
Here, the network address 192.168.19.9 and network mask 255.255.255. are
combined to create the subnet name 192.168.19.0/24."


Page 107: Incorrect Information About Accessing Network
-------------------------------------------------------

On page 107, under "Accessing the Network Through a Windows NT Domain", change:

"Windows 95 and Windows 98 systems can only access the network as part of a
Windows NT domain if Active Directory is running in mixed mode operations, and
there is a PDC emulator or BDC available to authenticate the logon."

To:

"Windows 95 and Windows 98 systems can access the network as part of a Windows NT
domain where Active Directory is running in either mixed mode or native mode and
there is a BDC available to authenticate the logon."


Page 114: Correction To PDC Emulator Section
--------------------------------------------

On page 114, change the last sentence under the bullet for PDC Emulator as
follows.

Change:
"You must assign one relative ID master in each domain in the forest."

To:
"You must assign one PDC emulator in each domain in the forest."


Page 118: Incorrect Information About ForeignSecurityPrincipals
---------------------------------------------------------------

On page 118, in the first paragraph, it states that ForeignSecurityPrincipals is
an organizational unit. This is incorrect. ForeignSecurityPrincipals is not an
organizational unit, but rather a default container for security identifiers
(SIDs) associated with objects from external, trusted domains.

Change:
"In Figure 6-1, I've created two organizational units in the seattle.domain.com
domain: ForeignSecurityPrincipals and Marketing."

To:
"In Figure 6-1, I've created one organizational unit in the seattle.domain.com
domain: Marketing."


Page 119: Incorrect Information In Viewing Advanced Options
-----------------------------------------------------------

Under "Viewing Advanced Options" on page 119 the ForeignSecurityPrincipals
advanced option is described as being displayed only after enabling Advanced
Features. This is incorrect. ForeignSecurityPrincipals is displayed by default
in Active Directory Users and Computers. The ForeignSecurityPrincipals bullet
item should be disregarded.


Page 141: Inaccurate Information About Universal Group Membership
-----------------------------------------------------------------

On page 141, in the last bulleted item,

Change:
"Members of global groups include accounts and groups from any domain in the
domain tree or forest."

To:
"Members of universal groups include accounts, global groups, and other universal
groups from any domain in the forest."
