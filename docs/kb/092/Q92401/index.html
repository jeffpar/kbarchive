SUMMARY
=======

When using the software included with the Microsoft Windows Sound System, you
may hear noise during the playback of sound files (*.WAV, *.MID, *.RMI, *.VOC,
*.SND, *.AIF). This noise is best described as an audible "hiss" and can be
caused by the following situations:

1. The Windows Sound System board has been installed next to a video board or
  the power supply.

2. The Windows Sound System volume has been set low while the volume of an
  external device (that is, speakers or amplifier) has been set high.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Windows Sound System board may pick up and amplify interference from other
boards that are not functioning correctly. Interference from the computers power
supply can also cause noise during the playback of sound files. The Windows
Sound System board should be installed as far away from the power supply and
other boards as possible.

Another cause of audible hissing is an inconsistency in the volume control of the
Windows Sound System and amplified external devices. For example, if the Windows
Sound System volume control is set low, while the volume control of external
speakers is set high, the speakers will amplify the low sound being produced by
the sound card. This will result in distortion or hissing during playback.

The Windows Sound System volume control should match that of any external devices
(that is, if Sound System's volume control is set at 50 percent, any external
device's volume control should also be set at 50 percent).
