MORE INFORMATION
================

Customizing Display
-------------------

The following text provides answers to common questions regarding customizing the
display of Windows for Workgroups Schedule+.

1. Q. Can the display be customized to show different colors?

  A. Yes. This can be done by choosing Display from the Options menu and
  adjusting the settings.

2. Q. Can you customize the display of time intervals in the daily calendar (for
  example, to display the day in 15-minute intervals)?

  A. It is not possible to customize the view; however, you can schedule
  appointments to start or end at any time. To alter a start or end time to
  something other than :00 or :30, double-click the appointment and use the
  Start or End controls to change the time. The start time is displayed in the
  appointment description and is used to set off the reminder at the
  appropriate time.

Managing Tasks
--------------

The following text provides answers to commonly asked questions about managing
tasks using Windows for Workgroups Schedule+.

1. Q. Do tasks "roll over" from one day to the next if they are not completed?
  A. Schedule+ has a model for tasks that is different from most programs of
  this type. Tasks are not associated with a particular day (however, you can
  assign a due date). You enter and view tasks in Tasks mode, which is
  completely different from Appointment Book mode. By the nature of this model,
  tasks are always present until you complete them or delete them from the
  list.

  The Show Active Tasks command allows you to view current tasks (those without
  a due date or with a due date or start work date prior to today) only. By
  contrast, other scheduling programs follow a model in which tasks are created
  on a particular day. Using that model, tasks may not appear until that day
  and then "roll over" to following days until they are completed.

2. Q. Is there any interaction between Microsoft Project and Schedule+ so that
  tasks assigned to me in Project can be put in my task list? A. In the version
  of Schedule+ that ships with Windows for Workgroups 3.1, other applications
  cannot make calls to Schedule+. This feature is under review and will be
  considered for inclusion in a future release.

Modifying Other Calendars
-------------------------

The following text provides answers to common questions regarding creating
appointments in another person's schedule using Windows for Workgroups
Schedule+.

1. Q. Are meetings entered by someone other than myself distinguished in any
  way?

  A. Yes. If you double-click an appointment created by someone else, the name
  of the person who created it is displayed at the bottom of the appointment
  details. However, the appointment is not identified by an icon or special
  color in the appointment book.

2. Q. How do you sign in as another user in order to view or modify that
  person's calendar?

  A. You do not need to sign in as another user to open that person's calendar.
  Schedule+ allows you to grant access privileges to other users with the
  Options/Set Access Privileges command. Once you have assigned privileges to
  another user, that person can view your calendar while signed in under his or
  her own account by choosing Open Other's Appointment Book from the File menu.

3. Q. If I have an assistant, do we both receive meeting messages for my
  meetings or does only my assistant receive them?

  A. You can specify either of the above. If you choose General Options from the
  Options menu, a check box that specifies Send Meeting Messages Only to My
  Assistant is displayed.

MS-DOS, Macintosh, and Connectivity
-----------------------------------

The following text provides answers to commonly asked questions about MS-DOS and
Macintosh connectivity with Windows for Workgroups Schedule+.

1. Q. Can you participate in a Schedule+ account if you are running the
  Macintosh Client of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks?

  A. No. To run Schedule+, one of the following conditions must exist:

   - You are running a Mail 3.0 Windows client against a Microsoft Mail Post
     Office (or another transport with a messaging driver transport).

   - You are running Mail for AppleTalk Networks. In this case, you can run
     Schedule+ for AppleTalk networks.

2. Q. Why is there no bridge between Schedule+ for Windows and Schedule+ for
  AppleTalk networks so that users on the two platforms can share free/busy
  information and send meeting requests to each other?

  A. Currently there are no plans for future development of Schedule+ for
  AppleTalk networks. Microsoft's development resources on the Macintosh
  platform are limited; the highest priority is to develop new versions of Mail
  for AppleTalk networks. A new calendar and scheduling solution for the
  Macintosh would need to be developed to achieve transport independence.

3. Q. What is the Schedule+ connectivity format?

  A. It is a specification of a file format that allows third-party MS-DOS-based
  and Windows-based scheduling applications to share free/busy information and
  exchange meeting requests with Schedule+. This format allows Microsoft to
  point a customer to a third-party vendor for an MS-DOS scheduling solution
  that works with Schedule+.

  The format was designed to support the use of group scheduling applications
  from different vendors on a network. The specification describes an
  interchange format that scheduling applications can read and write so that
  users of third-party products can see free/busy data of a Schedule+ user and
  vice versa. It also describes how, using FFAPI (Mail File Format API), these
  applications can send meeting requests and responses to Schedule+, and
  interpret meeting requests received from Schedule+.

  Note that any product can share free/busy information with Schedule+, but only
  products using Microsoft Mail as the transport (or in the future any
  application that supports MAPI) can exchange native meeting requests. A copy
  of the specification can be found in the Sourcebook.

OLE and Attachments
-------------------

The following text provides answers to commonly asked questions about OLE or
attachment usage with Windows for Workgroups Schedule+.

1. Q. Does Schedule+ support OLE?

  A. Schedule+ does not support OLE in any way. You cannot embed objects in
  appointments, in the notepad, or in the meeting request messages. This may be
  confusing because a meeting request message is a specialized Microsoft Mail
  message, and Mail supports OLE. However, Schedule+ does not support this
  feature.

2. Q. Does Schedule+ support attachments so that I can attach an agenda to my
  meeting request or attach a note to an appointment in my daily calendar?

  A. Schedule+ does not have an actual attachment feature. However, you can type
  an unlimited quantity of text into the appointment description. You can even
  scroll through the appointment entry using the cursor key. To see the entire
  note text in your calendar printout, you must print using the Text View
  format.

Printing
--------

The following text provides answers to commonly asked questions about printing
from Windows for Workgroups Schedule+.

1. Q. Can you customize print views in Schedule+?

  A. There are no printing customization capabilities built into Schedule+.
  However, you can export your appointments into Schedule+ (either ASCII text
  or text format) and then use a standard text editor to customize the
  information.

2. Q. When printing from Schedule+, there are three different print sizes. What
  are the dimensions of these print sizes?

  A. The formats are designed to match the most popular appointment book sizes:

  Standard = 8.5 x 11-inches
  Junior = 5.5 x 8.5-inches
  Pocket = 3.75 x 6.75-inches

Reminders Application
---------------------

The following text provides answers to commonly asked questions about the
Reminders application that is included with Windows for Workgroups Schedule+.

1. Q. Does Schedule+ support customized reminder sounds?

  A. Yes. If you are running Windows 3.1, you can modify the sound that is
  assigned to the Schedule+ Reminders in the Sound Control Panel.

  NOTE: A sound driver must first be installed in the Control Panel Drivers
  dialog box.

2. Q. How does the Reminders application work?

  A. The Reminders application is a separate application from Schedule+. The
  default installation (that is, Express Setup) installs Reminders into the
  Windows Startup group. This explains why you are asked to sign in when you
  start Windows, but after you sign in, no application seems to be started. In
  actuality, Reminders has started, but because it is a hidden application,
  this is not apparent. Reminders continues to run until you exit Windows or
  choose Turn Off Reminders from the File menu in Schedule+. You will be
  reminded of upcoming appointments while you are running Windows.

Remote Usage
------------

The following text provides answers to commonly asked questions about moving your
copy of Windows for Workgroups Schedule+ from one machine to another, as well as
accessing your copy from another machine.

1. Q. How do you take Schedule+ "on the road"?

  A. If you want to take your calendar with you to another machine (for example,
  a portable for travel), use the Move Local File command on the File menu to
  copy the calendar to a floppy disk.

  Then load Schedule+ on the destination computer. Use the Move Local File
  command to move it back. The command moves the calendar file to the location
  you specify and changes the SCHDPLUS.INI file so it searches for your
  calendar in the new location. This command might also be used if you decide
  you want to keep your calendar in the directory where you store data instead
  of in the Schedule+ program directory.

2. Q. Does Schedule+ have a "dial-in" capability?

  A. No. You can use Schedule+ offline (as described above) to view your local
  calendar or use LAN Manager RAS to access your calendar at the office, view
  other people's calendars, and schedule meetings. However, you cannot dial in,
  as you can with the MS-DOS Mail remote client. Also note that when you use
  Schedule+ offline, you cannot use any of the group-related capabilities. You
  cannot generate meeting requests and leave them in your outbox (as you can do
  when you are using the Windows Mail client).

Scheduling Meetings
-------------------

The following text provides answers to commonly asked questions about scheduling
meetings with Windows for Workgroups Schedule+.

1. Q. Does Schedule+ include all hours of each day as valid meeting times when
  the Auto-Pick command is used to search for a meeting time?

  A. To determine a meeting time, Auto-Pick looks only at weekdays
  (Monday-Friday) within the time defined by the Day Starts At and Day Ends At
  settings in the General Options dialog box. Schedule + looks only at the
  meeting initiator's settings to determine the valid times. Schedule+ does not
  recognize the nonworking hours of other users and you cannot define days
  other than Saturday or Sunday as nonworking days.

2. Q. Does Schedule+ support recurring meetings? For example, can I request a
  weekly staff meeting with my group so that when those people accept the
  meeting, it is automatically entered into their calendars for each week?

  A. Schedule+ supports recurring APPOINTMENTS, but not recurring MEETINGS.
  Schedule+ does not allow a you to request a recurring meeting with other
  people. This means you must request the meeting for a single occurrence and
  then remind the attendees to use the recurring appointment command to enter
  it for each week.

Scheduling Resources
--------------------

The following text provides answers to commonly asked questions about setting up
and scheduling resources with Windows for Workgroups Schedule+.

1. Q. How do you set up a resource, such as a conference room?

  A. Schedule+ makes it easy to set up shared resources (such as conference
  rooms and audio/visual equipment) so that they can be reserved over
  Schedule+. The network administrator creates an account for the resource
  using the Mail Admin program. Then he/she logs into Schedule+ under that
  account and selects the This Account Is For A Resource check box in the
  General Options dialog box (accessed by choosing General Options from the
  Options menu).

  This automatically changes the default access privilege to "Create Appts and
  Tasks." That means that people can book the resource by selecting it from the
  address book while they select attendees for a meeting. You can also use the
  File, Open Other's Appt Book command to look at the calendar for the resource
  and book time in it directly. It is also possible to assign an assistant to a
  resource and alter the default privilege to View Free and Busy Times if the
  administrator wants somebody to be in control of allocating the resource.

2. Q. Because each resource requires a user account, does this mean that each
  resource requires a user license?

  A. No. Microsoft licensing requires a license per workstation that runs the
  software, not per user account.

Time and Date Issues
--------------------

The following text provides answers to commonly asked questions about the time
and date features in Windows for Workgroups Schedule+.

1. Q. Are there options for altering the time and date displays (for example, to
  use a 24-hour or a European date format)?

  A. Yes. From the Windows Control Panel, choose the International icon. Here
  you can specify the format used for the date and the time. This change is
  reflected in Schedule+ also.

2. Q. Does Schedule+ account for time zone changes when a you request a meeting
  with someone in another time zone?

  A. No. However, if you have upgraded to Microsoft PC Mail version 3.0, you can
  modify the template files (using TEMPLATE.EXE) to include a field for time
  zones. This way, you can at least find out what time zone somebody is in by
  selecting Details.
