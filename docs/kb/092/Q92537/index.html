SUMMARY
=======

STKTRACE is a sample Windows-based application that contains the complete code
to obtain a stack trace of the "current task." The stack trace includes symbolic
information extracted from the symbol files, similar to that produced by the
Windows debug kernel at the time of a FatalExit. In this sample, the stack trace
is logged into a buffer and output to a message box.

The STKTRACE sample uses the tool helper library and can be used in the Windows
versions 3.0 and 3.1 environments because TOOLHELP.DLL is a redistributable.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

Usually, the Windows debug kernel produces a stack trace on the debug terminal
when the SPACE BAR or ENTER key is pressed at the time of a FatalExit. For more
information on stack traces produced by the debug kernel, query on the following
words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  " stack trace space bar " (without the quotation marks)

However, when you are writing a debugger or a large complex application, it might
be necessary to produce stack traces in your application. Then, the STKTRACE
sample code can be helpful.

This sample consists of two main modules, GETTRACE.C and GETSYMBOL.C, and a
driver module, STKTRACE.C, which merely calls the API from the GETTRACE.C
module. The GETTRACE.C module contains code to walk the stack of the current
task by using the tool helper library and the GETSYMBOL.C module contains code
to obtain symbol names from corresponding symbol (.SYM) files by using the
symbol file format. These two modules can be plugged into any application or a
DLL (dynamic-link library).

Note that the THSAMPLE application in the \SDK31\SAMPLES\TOOLHELP directory also
illustrates how to produce stack traces for a given task that is not the current
task. In contrast, the STKTRACE sample walks the stack of the current task by
obtaining the register values from the stack and using the StackTraceCSIPFirst()
and StackTraceNext() APIs from the tool helper library. Also, the STKTRACE
sample provides symbolic information in the stack trace.

The GETSYM.C module provides symbolic information by using the symbol file format
documented in the Microsoft Windows SDK version 3.1 "Programmer's Reference,
Volume 4: Resources" manual. Given a segment:offset address, this module finds
the "nearest" public symbol in the corresponding symbol (.SYM) file.
