The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

A "clean boot" (starting your computer after all unnecessary commands have been
removed from your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files) is used as a basic
troubleshooting step to test possible conflicts between Windows for Workgroups
3.1 and various terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs and device drivers.
There are different types of clean boots; the correct one to use depends on
whether or not Windows for Workgroups has been installed.

NOTE: This article explains how to clean boot your system up to the point when
you start Windows. To start Windows without loading any third-party programs,
you must clear the StartUp group, clear the LOAD= and RUN= entries in the
WIN.INI file, and ensure the SHELL= entry in the SYSTEM.INI file is loading
PROGMAN.EXE. Also, make sure the SYSTEM.INI file does not include third-party
virtual device drivers (VxDs) or other third-party Windows components.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before Clean Booting
--------------------

Create a bootable floppy disk that contains the MS-DOS system files and any other
files that are required to make the system operational, such as disk-compression
utilities (for example, Stacker), disk- partitioning drivers (for example, Disk
Manager), and other third-party device drivers.

To Clean Boot Before Running Windows for Workgroups Setup
---------------------------------------------------------

If you are not using any disk-compression software, disk-partitioning software,
or other third-party drivers necessary to boot the computer, the machine can be
booted on a floppy disk that contains only the MS-DOS system files, without a
CONFIG.SYS or AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

If there is disk-partitioning, disk-compression, or other third-party software
required to boot the computer, the startup files on the disk created above
should appear as follows:

  CONFIG.SYS                              AUTOEXEC.BAT
  ----------------------------------------------------

  FILES=45                                PROMPT $P$G
  BUFFERS=20
  &lt;Third-party disk-partitioning driver &gt;
  &lt;Third-party disk-compression driver&gt;
  &lt;Other required third-party driver&gt;

After Windows for Workgroups 3.1 is installed with Novell NetWare as a second
network, a clean boot should appear as follows:

  CONFIG.SYS                                    AUTOEXEC.BAT
  ----------------------------------------------------------

  FILES=45                                      &lt;valid path&gt;NET START
  BUFFERS=20                                    &lt;valid path&gt;MSIPX
  DEVICE=C:\&lt;Windows 3.1 directory&gt;\HIMEM.SYS   &lt;valid path&gt;NETX
  &lt;Third-party disk-partitioning driver&gt;        PROMPT $P$G
  &lt;Third-party disk-compression driver&gt;         PATH=C:\WINDOWS;C:\DOS;C:\ 
  &lt;Other required third-party drivers&gt;          SET TEMP=C:\&lt;valid path&gt;
  DEVICE=&lt;valid path&gt;\PROTMAN.DOS /I:&lt;directory
          where PROTOCOL.INI is located&gt;
  DEVICE=&lt;MAC DRIVER&gt;.DOS
  DEVICE=&lt;valid path&gt;MSIPX.SYS
  DEVICE=&lt;valid path&gt;WORKGRP.SYS
  SHELL=C:\&lt;valid path&gt;\COMMAND.COM  /E:1024 /P
  LASTDRIVE=P
  STACKS=9,256

Exceptions
----------

The following are examples of drivers that should NOT be removed; these drivers
are used when the computer is turned on to make the hard drive accessible. This
is not a complete list, but it does include most of the commonly used drivers:

  Hard Disk Drivers:          SQY55.SYS, SSTBIO.SYS, SSTDRIVE.SYS,
                              AH1544.SYS, ILIM386.SYS, ASPI4DOS.SYS,
                              SCSIHA.SYS, SCSIDSK.EXE, SKYDRVI.SYS,
                              ATDOSXL.SYS, NONSTD.SYS

  Disk-Partitioning Drivers:  DMDRVR.BIN, SSTOR.SYS, HARDRIVE.SYS,
                              EDVR.SYS, FIXT_DRV.SYS, LDRIVE.SYS,
                              ENHDISK.SYS

  Disk-Compression Utilities: STACKER.COM, SSWAP.COM, SSTOR.EXE,
                              DEVSWAP.COM

If the purpose of a device driver or program is unknown, do NOT remove it. Most
device drivers and programs display a message describing the purpose when they
are initialized.

A clean boot does NOT include the following:

- DOS=HIGH,UMB

- EMM386.EXE

- INSTALL=SHARE.EXE

- INSTALL=FASTOPEN.EXE

- Third-party memory managers

- RAM disk devices

- JOIN, GRAPHICS, PRINT, SUBST, APPEND

- MODE for printer redirection

- Multiple path statements

- MS-DOS-level mouse drivers

- Third-party disk caches

- Various third-party TSRs

- LOGIMENU, CLICK

- Virus checkers

- Drivers for scanners/fax

- Drivers for CD-ROM/network

- Tape backup spoolers/redirectors/buffers

- Data acquisition units

- Keyboard accelerators/buffers
