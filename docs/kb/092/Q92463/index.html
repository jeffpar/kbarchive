MORE INFORMATION
================

Infinite Disk is a utility program designed to optimize disk space by performing
three types of activities on your hard disk:

- File aging

- Automatic migration of qualified files

- Automatic recall of any migrated file when opened

File Aging
----------

File aging is performed by IDRES.EXE, an Infinite Disk terminate-and-stay-
resident (TSR) program that changes the creation date of all files to the date
the program was installed.

Automatic Migration
-------------------

Migration is the process of moving a file from one storage level to the next.

  Level 0 = Standard file with no compression
  Level 1 = A file that has been compressed by Infinite Disk
  Level 2 = A file that has been removed from the local hard disk

Infinite Disk automatically migrates files from one level to the next based on
age criteria that you define during installation.

Automatic Recall
----------------

Recall is the process of decompression and/or restoring a file from a Level 1 or
Level 2 migration.

The product included here is manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
