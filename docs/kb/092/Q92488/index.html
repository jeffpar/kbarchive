SUMMARY
=======

MicroKey/Audio Port is an external sound adapter manufactured by Video
Associates Labs that allows you to record and play high-quality digital audio
(wave and vocal files) through a parallel port.

Sound Recorder can be used to play and record wave (.WAV) files through
MicroKey/AudioPort.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Sound Recorder can play all standard Wave files formats, as well as the
MicroKey/AudioPort ADPCM 4-bit compressed format. However, it does not provide a
means for selecting which format to record.

By default, the Sound Recorder records audio files at 22kHz, 16 bits when used
with the MicroKey/AudioPort. If recording audio using different formats is
desired, do the following:

1. Copy the set of record template files from the MicroKey/AudioPort Windows
  Disk 1 to a subdirectory on the hard drive. These files are all in the form

  RECssMbb.WAV

  where "ss" indicates the sample rate and "bb" indicates the sample size. To
  copy these files to the Windows directory, type:

  copy a:\rec*.wav c:\windows

2. Start Sound Recorder and choose Option from the File menu. Select the
  directory where the record template files are stored and select the template
  file that matches the sample rate and size.

3. Record the desired audio.

4. From the File menu, choose Save As to store the audio segment to a file. The
  audio will be saved in the same format as that of the loaded record template
  file.

Files recorded using the compressed (*M4.WAV) format are compatible only with
MicroKey/AudioPort. It may be unlikely that other audio products will play these
files.

The template files are write-protected to prevent accidental erasure. To remove
the files from the hard drive, change the read-only attributes associated with
each file.

For further information, contact Video Associates Labs (VAL).
