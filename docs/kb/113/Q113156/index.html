-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The "MS-DOS 6.2 Step By Step" (first printing) companion disk installation
program does not ask for a blank disk. This contradicts page xxi under step #3,
where the book says:

  When asked to place a new blank disk in the drive, be sure to use a disk with
  the highest capacity that your drive can handle.(For more details, refer to
  "Identifying Types of Floppy Disks," in Lesson2.)

When the installation program runs, it never asks for a blank disk.

CAUSE
=====

The installation program does not make use of a blank disk. The paragraph below
step 3 on page xxi is an error in the first printing of this book, and should be
substituted with the information below.

RESOLUTION
==========

Ignore the paragraph directly below step 3 on page xxi. This paragraph is an
error in the first printing of this book. The installation program does not make
a backup as these instructions indicate.

A copy practice disk must be created. This disk will be referenced throughout the
lessons in the book.

To create a copy practice disk, complete the following step. (Current printings
have this step included as step 4.)

  3.5 When the installation is completed, copy the practice files to a new
  floppy disk. Insert a blank, formatted disk in the drive. If you're not
  certain that the disk is formatted, follow steps 3 through 7 on page 21
  before continuing. Then type the following commands, pressing the ENTER key
  after each command. (If your floppy disk is in drive B, substitute B: for the
  A: in these commands.)

     XCOPY C:\SBS1STEP A:\SBS1STEP /S /E
     XCOPY C:\SBSLESSN A:\SBSLESSN /S /E
     XCOPY C:\SBSREV&amp;P A:\SBSREV&amp;P /S /E

  After you enter each command, MS-DOS asks you whether you have specified a
  file name or directory name. Press D for directory.

IMPORTANT: MS-DOS 6.2 Step By Step references the practice disk several times in
this book, so it is very important to complete the step outlined above.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in "Microsoft Press MS-DOS 6.2 Step
By Step" printing 1. This problem was corrected in "Microsoft Press MS-DOS Step
By Step 6.2" printing 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An errata sheet is available from Microsoft Press Technical Support. The
information in the errata sheet is the same as the information provided in this
article.
