The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft provides a replacement for the MSRMTTR.DLL file that is included with
version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows.

For complete information about obtaining and installing the MSRMTTR.DLL file, see
the following sections:

- To download the updated file

- To update your MSRMTTR.DLL file

MORE INFORMATION
================

This update contains the MSRMTTR.DLL file, a replacement for the MSRMTTR.DLL
file that is included with versions 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows.
This replacement file provides additional enhancements to the original
MSRMTTR.DLL file, correcting the following problems:

- The algorithm used to compare strings received by the script command WAITRSP
  did not correctly identify valid strings.

- The Echo command used to be ignored in modem scripts for EXTERNAL.EXE
  versions 3.2.x and Mail Remote for Windows.


- A message remaining in the Outbox could be misdirected if the remote address
  book was updated without uploading messages. The client will now check for
  the outbound messages prior to updating the address book. To ensure this fix
  works correctly, the following DLLs must be upgraded in conjunction with this
  DLL:

     MSRMT.DLL    version 3.2.4013
     MSRMTCN.DLL  version 3.2.4013
     MSRMTSU.DLL  version 3.2.4013
     MSRMTUI.DLL  version 3.2.4013&lt;/ITEM&gt;&lt;/STEPS&gt;

----------------------------

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

After you download MSRUPD.EXE to a clean directory, run it (by typing "msrupd"
(without the quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt) to extract the
contents of the file. You should receive the following files:

  MSRMTTR.DLL (76,576 bytes, dated 6-15-95, 5:58 P.M.)
  README.TXT

To update your MSRMTTR.DLL file
-------------------------------

1. Verify that the Microsoft Mail Remote driver (MSRMT.DLL) is the current
  driver in the Mail System Selector (MAILDRV.EXE) by running the Mail System
  Selector from the Windows Program Manager, choosing Microsoft Mail Remote,
  and then selecting Set As Current Mail Driver.

2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

  " copy &lt;path&gt;:\msrmttr.dll &lt;destination&gt; " (without the quotation
  marks)

  where &lt;path&gt; is the drive and directory where you ran the self-
  extracting MSRUPD.EXE file and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory
  where your MSRMTTR.DLL file currently resides. For example, if you ran the
  self-extracting file from the TEST directory on drive D, and your MSRMTTR.DLL
  is located in the Windows SYSTEM directory on drive C, type the following
  command:

  " copy d:\test\msrmttr.dll c:\windows\system " (without the quotation marks)
