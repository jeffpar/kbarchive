SYMPTOMS
========

With the DLC protocol under Windows NT, you can select only one Network
Interface Card (NIC) for printing to Hewlett-Packard Co. (HP) Jetdirect or other
network printers. If your Windows NT machine has two NIC's on different network
segments with HP Jetdirect printers, you can print to or share a printer from
only one segment at a time.

CAUSE
=====

This is a limitation of HPMON, which controls DLC printing in Windows NT.

WORKAROUND
==========

To print to the second NIC (or segment), you have to select a different adapter
from the Advanced Options for HP Network Ports option in Print Manager, then
reboot the machine.

When you select the Secondary(1) adapter, you are prompted to restart the Spooler
service. To do this, run Control Panel, choose Services, select Spooler, choose
stop, and then choose start. When you go back into Print Manager and create the
printer, the Advanced Options for HP Network Ports dialog box displays the
JetDirect addresses on the secondary network adapter.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default the HP printer software, HPMON, uses the "primary" adapter setting.
If you set up the HP printer on the "secondary" adapter, print jobs will be
lost.

The primary or secondary adapters correspond to the first and second NIC's that
the DLC protocol is bound to.

To view the DLC binding order:

1. In Control Panel, choose the Network icon. Choose Bindings. Choose DLC
  protocol.

2. From Print Manager, choose the "Printer" connected to the physical HP network
  print device.

3. Select settings.

4. When the "Configure HP Network peripheral port option" window appears, click
  on the Options button.

5. The window titled "Advanced option for all HP network ports" appears. The
  adapter choice is listed here.

6. Choose the appropriate adapter, according to the DLC protocol binding list,
  or change the bind order to match the primary and secondary settings.

7. Open Control Panel - Services, select Spooler, then stop and restart the
  Spooler service.

8. Go back to Print Manager and view the HP JetDirect addresses; these addresses
  are on the network connected to the secondary network adapter.

9. Select the desired printer and complete printer setup.

NOTE: Since Windows NT does not rely on LANA numbers, changing the binding order
does not affect system performance in any way. For more information on binding
order, refer to article Q103275: How to Find LANA Numbers for Applications.

STATUS
======

This limitation is by design. HPMON is owned by Hewlett Packard Co.
