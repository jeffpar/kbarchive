SUMMARY
=======

The engine sounds for the Lear Jet may cut in and out when you are using
SoundBlaster 16 or SoundBlaster 16 ASP sound cards. The engine sounds for the
Cessna will sound correct.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem may occur for one of the following three reasons:

1. PROBLEM: The High DMA channel for the sound card is set to a 16 bit channel.

  RESOLUTION: The SoundBlaster 16 and SoundBlaster 16 ASP use a High DMA channel
  as well as a standard DMA channel. Changing the High DMA channel to use the
  standard DMA channel may correct this problem, as follows:

  a. Open the AUTOEXEC.BAT file using a text editor such as the MS-DOS Editor
     utility.

  b. Locate the line that says:

  SET BLASTER=

  c. Change the number that appears after the H parameter so that it matches
     the number after the D parameter.

2. PROBLEM: There is not enough EMS memory configured.

  RESOLUTION: Making the following changes to the Expanded Memory Manager may
  correct the sound problem:

  a. If you are using EMM386 as your Expanded Memory Manager:

  i. Open the CONFIG.SYS file using a text editor such as the MS-DOS Editor
  utility.

  ii. Locate the line that says DEVICE=&lt;path&gt;EMM386.EXE, where
  &lt;path&gt; is the path to your EMM386.EXE file.

  iii. Modify it so that it reads as follows:

  DEVICE=&lt;path&gt;EMM386.EXE 2048 RAM

  b. If you are using a third party Expanded Memory Manager, consult the
     manufacturer's documentation on how to configure EMS memory (2048K or
     more.)

3. PROBLEM: Too few EMS handles are configured, or the DMA buffer size is too
  small.

  RESOLUTION: Making the following changes to the Expanded Memory Manager may
  correct the sound problem.

  a. If you are using EMM386 as your Expanded Memory Manager:

  i. Open the CONFIG.SYS file using a text editor such as the MS-DOS Editor
  utility.

  ii. Add the following to the end of the EMM386.EXE line in the CONFIG.SYS
  file:

  H=255 D=64

  b. If you are using a third party Expanded Memory Manager, consult the
     manufacturer's documentation on the following topics:

      - How to increase EMS file handles (to 255)
      - How to increase DMA buffer size (to 64)
