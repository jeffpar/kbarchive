SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows NT version 3.1 currently supports the Adaptec 2740 and 2742
SCSI adapters in Adaptec's 274x adapter series. Support for Adaptec models
2740W, 2742W, 2740T, 2742T, 2740A, 2742A, 2740A-W, 2742A-W, 2740A-T, and 2742A-T
is provided by obtaining a driver from Adaptec.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Adaptec 274x SCSI adapters are 32-bit EISA adapters using the AIC 7770 RISC
chip. They support multitasking, multi-input/output, and tag queuing.

As with most Adaptec models, a model number ending in 2 (such as the 2742)
indicates support for floppy disk drives, while models ending in 0 (such as the
2740) do not support floppy disk drives.

Some models end with letters. The following explains what the letters indicate:

W - Wide SCSI. These models support 16 megabytes (MB) data transfer and are
  generally used for hard disk drives designed for this transfer speed.
  Only SCSI devices that support wide SCSI can take advantage of the
  higher data transfer rate. The external connector on this card is a 68-
  pin P connector. Other than the additional pins, it looks similar to a
  SCSI-2 connector.

T - Twin Channel. These adapters support 14 SCSI devices - either 7
  external and 7 internal devices, or 14 internal devices.

A - Indicates that this model is based on the AIC-7770 revision E RISC
  processor. Models without the "A" are based on the AIC-7770 revision C
  RISC processor.


According to Adaptec product support, their version of ARROW.SYS does support
models 2740W, 2742W, 2740T, 2742T, 2740A, 2742A, 2740A-W, 2742A-W, 2740A-T,
2742A-T. This driver can be obtained by downloading the file 2X4XWNT.ZIP from
the Adaptec BBS at (408) 945-7727. All support for the Adaptec driver is
provided by Adaptec. You can call Adaptec Technical Support at (408) 945-2550.
