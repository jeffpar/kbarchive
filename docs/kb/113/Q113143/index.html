Purpose
-------

This Application Note includes a batch converter program that you can
use to convert multiple PowerPoint version 3.0 or 4.0 for Windows
files to PowerPoint for Windows 95 format. When you run the batch
converter, you can select an unlimited number of PowerPoint files from
different folders, drives, and shares. The batch converter translates
all the files in the batch and copies them to the destination folder
you specify, giving the files a common extension (.ppt). The original
files remain intact in their source locations.

Setting Up the Batch Converter
------------------------------

The PowerPoint for Windows 95 Batch Converter consists of three files:

  Ppconv.exe
  Threed.vbx
  Vboa300.dll

To set up the PowerPoint for Windows 95 Batch Converter, follow these
steps:

1. Copy the Ppconv.exe file from the enclosed WT1230 disk to any
  folder on your hard disk.

  If you downloaded the Wt1230.exe file from an online service and
  extracted it, copy the Ppconv.exe file from the folder where you
  extracted it to any folder on your hard disk.

2. Copy the Threed.vbx and Vboa300.dll files from the enclosed WT1230
  disk (or download folder) to your Windows\System subfolder. (If
  these files already exist in this folder and are newer than the new
  ones you're moving, do not replace the files.)

  NOTE: For more information about copying or moving files in
  Windows 95, click the Start button, click Help, and then query on
  the words "files copying" or "files moving" (without the quotation
  marks).

Using the Batch Converter
-------------------------

To convert multiple PowerPoint version 3.0 or 4.0 for Windows files to
PowerPoint for Windows 95 format, do the following:

1. Run Ppconv.exe.

  The PowerPoint for Windows 95 Batch Converter dialog box appears.

2. In the Source File Selection window, switch to the folder you want
  to copy files from by double-clicking the appropriate folder name.

  NOTE: For more information on finding files and folders, click the
  Start button, click Help, and then query on the words "find file" or
  "find folder" (without the quotation marks).

3. Specify a destination drive and folder for the converted files by
  entering the fully qualified path in the Target Directory box.

  NOTE: You cannot specify a network location for the target
  directory using universal naming convention (UNC). To specify a
  network location, see the "More Information" section of this
  Application Note.

4. In the box to the right of the Source File Selection list, select
  the files you want to convert, and then click Add. The full path
  and file name (for both source and destination) for each file you
  add is listed in the Destination section.

  NOTE: If you want to convert all the files in a given folder at one
  time, click Select All, and then click Add.

5. Repeat this process until all the files you want to convert are
  listed.

  NOTE: You can select files from different folders or different
  network locations, add them to the list, and convert them in the
  same batch process.

6. The Target Extension box defaults to "ppt." This is the target
  extension for PowerPoint files. Changing the Target Extension may
  produce unexpected results and is not recommended.

7. Click Convert.

PowerPoint will start, and the Batch Converter will open, convert, and
close each file you added to the list. After completion, the Batch
Converter will display a message asking if you want to close
PowerPoint for Windows 95. If you have no other work to perform in
PowerPoint, click Yes.

More Information
----------------

The PowerPoint for Windows 95 Batch Converter does not support
universal naming convention (UNC). If you attempt to specify a target
directory using UNC, the converter prompts you with an alert that
states it does not support UNC.

UNC is used in networking and is a way of naming or addressing a
particular entity by following the naming convention:

  \\&lt;Server Name&gt;\&lt;Share name&gt;

This is different from the usual method of addressing a network
location, which is mapping a designated drive letter to a network
location.

To specify a network target directory location, you must first map the
location to a designated drive letter (using Windows Explorer, for
example), and then specify the fully qualified path, including the
drive letter, in the Target Directory box.
