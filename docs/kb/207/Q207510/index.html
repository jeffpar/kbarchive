The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you remotely connect to an Internet Information Server (IIS) computer using
the Internet Service Manager (ISM) in the Microsoft Management Console (MMC),
and you attempt to make a directory or virtual directory into an application,
the following error message is displayed:

  An error occurred reading or setting a configuration parameter.
  (0x80080005)

Also, when you use the Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) MMC snap-in and attempt
to open a package, the following error message occurs:

  An error occurred accessing components in the system package on this
  computer.
  Error code was 8080005. Make sure that:
  Microsoft Transaction server is installed correctly
  If you have set a specific identity for the system
  package, check that the user account and password are correct.

CAUSE
=====

During the Microsoft Transaction Server portion of the Windows NT Option Pack
installation, the user may have accepted the default of Local administration,
rather than Remote. Therefore, no remote administration user account was set for
MTS.

RESOLUTION
==========

To specify an account for the MTS package's identity, which can also be used for
remote administration, perform the following steps:

1. If you do not have an account to use for remote administration, create one
  using User Manager.

2. On the IIS computer, in the scope (left-hand) pane of the MMC, go to the
  following branch:

  Microsoft Transaction Server
 Computers
   My Computer
     Packages Installed

3. Right-click the package where the identity needs to be changed, and then
  click Properties on the context menu.

4. Click the Identity tab.

5. Select the This user radio button, and then provide the user account and
  password to use.
  Note: Be sure to include the domain in the user text box, followed by a
  backslash before the user's name, in the form of
  &lt;DomainName&gt;\&lt;UserName&gt;

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, MTS packages run as Interactive User. However, for remote
administration, it is preferable to run a package as a Windows NT user account.
