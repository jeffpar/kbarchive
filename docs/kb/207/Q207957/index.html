The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0

- Microsoft BackOffice Server versions 4.0, 4.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to log on to a Windows NT server, workstation, or domain
controller using account credentials from a trusted domain, you may receive the
following error:

  The system cannot log you on to this domain because the trust relationship
  between the primary domain and the trusted domain failed.

CAUSE
=====

This problem will occur if the trust was broken at the accounts domain
(trusted), but not the resource domain (trusting).

NOTE: You can use the Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 resource kit utility Netdom.exe
file to check both the status of the trust and re-create the trust.

RESOLUTION
==========

Break the trust in both the account and resource domains, and then re-establish
it on both sides.

Break the Trust Relationship
----------------------------

1. To break the trust on the primary domain controller (PDC) in the &lt;resource
  domain&gt;, click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools,
  and then double-click User Manager for Domains.

2. On the Policies menu, click Trust Relationships.

3. Select the &lt;accounts domain&gt; from the Trusted Domains list box and
  click Remove.

4. When prompted to complete the removal, click Yes

5. At the PDC in the &lt;accounts domain&gt;, click Start, point to Programs,
  point to Administrative Tools, and then double-click User Manager for
  Domains.

6. On the Policies menu, click Trust Relationships.

7. Select the &lt;resource domain&gt; from the Trusting Domains list box and
  click Remove.

8. When prompted to complete the removal, click Yes

Re-establish the Trust Relationship
-----------------------------------

1. On the PDC in the &lt;accounts domain&gt;, click Start, point to Programs,
  point to Administrative Tools, and then double-click User Manager for
  Domains.

2. On the Policies menu, click Trust Relationships, and then click Add next to
  the Trusting Domains list box.

3. In the Add Trusting Domain dialog box, type in the &lt;resource domain&gt;
  name. Enter a &lt;password&gt; that you will use for the resource domain to
  access the accounts domain, retype the &lt;password&gt; in the Confirmation
  field, and then click OK.

4. On the PDC in the &lt;resource domain&gt;, click Start, point to Programs,
  point to Administrative Tools, and then double-click User Manager for
  Domains.

5. On the Policies menu, click Trust Relationships, and then click Add next to
  the Trusted Domains list box.

6. In the Add Trusted Domain dialog box, type in the &lt;accounts domain&gt;
  name and the &lt;password&gt; that you supplied in step 3.

7. Click OK in the "Trust Relationship With &lt;accounts domain&gt; Successfully
  Established" dialog box.
