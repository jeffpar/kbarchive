-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Smsls.bat or Smsman.exe to install the Systems Management Server
(SMS) 2.0 client software on a target Windows NT- or Windows 2000-based
computer, the SMS 2.0 client installation may not be completed successfully.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because you are unable to install SMS 2.0 client software
on a Windows NT- or Windows 2000-based computer if the Workstation and Server
services are not running. When you disable either of these services, the client
is not supported as an SMS 2.0 client, and the networking abilities of the
client are limited.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information about Windows NT Workstation and Server services, consult
the Windows NT Resource Kit, Chapter 1, "Windows NT Networking Architecture."

The following log files are created on Windows NT- and Windows 2000-based
computers on which the SMS 2.0 client installation was unsuccessful. These logs
are located in the %SystemRoot%\Ms\Sms\Logs folder.
