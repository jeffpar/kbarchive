-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Urban Assault, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click Last Saved on the Single Player screen in Urban Assault, the
program may stop responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if both of the following conditions are true:

- You last saved the game when you were on a level that contained an activated
  Stoudson bomb.

- You last saved the game when you were in the host station turret.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, restart your computer, and then modify your last saved
game file. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Restart your computer

2. Click Start, and then click Run.

3. In the Open box, type the following line (with quotation marks), and then
  click OK

  "&lt;drive&gt;:\program files\microsoft games\urban assault
  \save\&lt;user&gt;\user.txt "

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter of the hard disk on which Urban
  Assault is installed, and &lt;user&gt; is the user name for the player (by
  default, &lt;user&gt; is "sdu7").

4. When you are prompted to use WordPad instead of Notepad to open the file,
  click Yes.

5. On the Edit menu, click Find.

6. In the Find What box, type "begin_robo = 56" (without the quotation marks),
  and then click Find Next.

7. Click Cancel.

8. Under the "begin_robo = 56" line, change the "viewer=" line and the "user="
  line to match the following two lines:

      viewer = yes
      user = yes

9. On the Edit menu, click Find.

10. In the Find What box, type "begin_extraviewer" (without the quotation
  marks), and then click Find Next.

11. Click Cancel.

12. Delete the following four lines:

  begin_extraviewer
      kind = robogun
      number = 0
  end

13. On the File menu, click Exit. When you are prompted to save the changes,
  click Yes.

14. Start Urban Assault.

15. On the startup screen, click Single Player.

16. On the Single Player screen, click Last Saved.

To prevent this issue from occuring, exit the turret before you save the game if
you are on a level that contains an activated Stoudson bomb.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft Urban Assault,
version 1.0.
