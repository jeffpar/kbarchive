SUMMARY
=======

NOTE: Microsoft Visual C++ NET (2002) supports both the managed code model that
is provided by the .NET Framework and the unmanaged native Microsoft Windows
code model. The information in this article applies to unmanaged Visual C++ code
only.

The DateTimePropPage.exe sample shows how to create a Date/Time Generic ActiveX
Property Page by using ATL.

When developing an ActiveX control, it is a common practice to include a property
page or pages to facilitate setting design-time properties. When the ActiveX
control has a certain type of property (for example, OLE_COLOR), it makes sense
to save time and use the stock property pages provided by Microsoft.

However, if there isn't a stock property page for the property you are working
with and you know that you could use such a property page several times, it
might be more efficient to create a single property page that can be re-used
when needed.

ATL allows you to use the property page for an ATL ActiveX control without having
to move the MFC DLL.

This ATL project contains two projects:

- DateTimePropPage, which is an ATL project that implements a property page.

- TestControl, which is an ActiveX control that uses the Date/Time property
  page.

A Month Calendar control and Date Time control are added to the property page
dialog box resource of the DateTimePropPage project. This resource is displayed
when the property page is invoked. Notification handlers are added to the
CDateTime class to handle the case where the date or time are changed through
the dialog box controls. Thus, SetDirty(TRUE) can be called, which causes the
Apply button to be activated on the property sheet that hosts the property
page.

The key functions in the implementation of this project are OnInitDialog, Apply,
GetProperties, and SetProperties, which are described below:

- OnInitDialog: Override this function to obtain the properties from the
  control, and initialize the Month Calendar and Date Time controls of the
  property page.

- Apply: Override this function to set the properties for each ActiveX control
  that the property page is representing.

- GetProperties: This is a helper function that is called from OnInitDialog to
  obtain the properties from the control. It gets the IDispatch interface of
  the first control, and gets the dispatch IDs of the "DATE" and "TIME"
  property of the control by calling IDispatch-&gt;GetIDsOfNames. It then calls
  IDispatch-&gt;Invoke to get the property values from the ActiveX control.

- SetProperties: This is a helper function that is called from Apply. The
  SetProperties function is called to set the properties for each ActiveX
  control for which the properties are being changed. This function gets the
  IDispatch interface from the control, calls IDispatch-&gt;GetIDsOfNamesto get
  the dispatch IDs of the properties, and calls IDispatch-&gt;Invoke to set the
  properties in the ActiveX control.

The ActiveX control supplied with this sample shows how to use the property page.
The ActiveX control has two properties, DATE and TIME. Another ActiveX control
that uses the standard Date/Time property page just needs to add a DATE and TIME
property to the ActiveX control. These properties must be of the DATE data type.
