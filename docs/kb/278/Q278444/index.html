SYMPTOMS
========

Messages may loop in a site when high-priority messages are sent. Message loops
result in non-delivery reports (NDRs).

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because of the way that high-priority messages are
handled. The sequence of events is as follows:

- High-priority messages are submitted on a server with a local X.400 connector
  to the destination site. A new association is opened for each message; as a
  result, nine associations are opened between the two sites.

- When the next message arrives, the server tries again to open a new
  association. The attempt does not work; it is rejected by the remote end
  because the limit has been reached (the remote server logs a 57 event). If
  there are other servers in the site that have equal-cost X.400 connectors to
  the remote site, the message transfer agent (MTA) relays new high-priority
  messages to a second bridgehead server. A similar process occurs; up to nine
  associations are made between this second server and the remote site.

- After all these associations are used, messages are relayed to a third
  server.

- After all the associations have been used on the third server, messages are
  relayed back to the first. The first server now generates an NDR for the
  message with a loop detect. The loop is detected by using the internal trace
  information for each message extension.

- After all the associations are open, even normal priority messages start to
  loop.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 service pack that contains
this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.
