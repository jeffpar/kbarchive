-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
- Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, versions 1.0, 1.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

COM Transaction Integrator (COMTI) issues an Advanced Program-to-Program
Communications (APPC) deallocate, even if no transaction call is made to the
host program due to invalid data passed into COMTI from the client program. When
the host receives this deallocate, an error log entry is created on the host;
this has caused resource problems in some host environments.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0
SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3; and Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS
versions 1.0, 1.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3.

This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

COMTI always checks the input that is coming in from the client to make certain
that the datatypes are valid for the parameters that are being passed up to the
host. If there is a problem with the data, COMTI posts an event, raises an error
to the client, and then cleans up the APPC session. In cleaning up the APPC
session, COMTI also issues a deallocate to the host. The hotfix changes the
behavior of COMTI so that it does not issue the deallocate if the host
transaction program is not called.
