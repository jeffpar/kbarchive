SYMPTOMS
========

Recurring appointments that are created by Collaboration Data Objects (CDO) such
as Outlook Web Access or AutoAccept Script through Events Service in Exchange
Server, may not be reflected in the local or public free-and-busy map for the
mailbox.

CAUSE
=====

In some cases, the recurring appointment data that is held in binary form on a
mailbox's calendar may exceed more than one binary record. If the data exceeds
more than one record, the appointment Entry ID (EID) is needed to link the
multiple records together. The process by which CDO extracts the appointments
and necessary MAPI properties to build the local and public free-and-busy map
does not include the EID of appointments. The failure to extract this EID
property cause CDO to be unable to retrieve these particular appointments into
its result set. This, in turn, causes the free-and-busy data for these
particular appointments to not get propagated out to the local or public
free-and-busy maps.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.5 service pack that contains
this fix.

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in

STATUS

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The CDO process for propagating the free-and-busy data from a mailbox calendar
to the Free/Busy public folder for a given site is as follows:

- A change is made to a mailbox calendar item.

- After the change is made, the mailbox-wide MAPI property that holds the
  free-and-busy data is deleted in its entirety.

- CDO queries an already established table of appointments to get a list from
  which to regenerate the free-and-busy data for the mailbox.

- This CDO list is taken from the first day of the current month and spans one
  year from that day. That is, if a change is made on November 8, 2000, the
  free-and-busy data is regenerated between the dates November 1, 2000, and
  November 1, 2001.

- Free-and-busy data is then extracted from this CDO list, and the mailbox-wide
  MAPI property is rebuilt to include this new data.

- From this new data in the local free-and-busy map, a message is queued up to
  be sent to the site's Free/Busy public folder.

It is important to understand the process when you are troubleshooting
free-and-busy problems. You must understand that the public free-and-busy data
is populated by what is in the mailbox's local free-and-busy map. So, if
inconsistencies are seen between a mailbox's calendar and the public
free-and-busy data, investigate the local free-and-busy data first. If the local
free-and-busy data is not synchronized with the mailbox's calendar, the public
free-and-busy data will not be correct.
