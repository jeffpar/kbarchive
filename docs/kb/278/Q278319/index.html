SUMMARY
=======

When you use the run method of the Wscript.shell object in an Active Server
Pages (ASP) page that is running in-process (in Inetinfo.exe), the command that
is called is executed in the system context. This is because the run method uses
CreateProcess to launch the command. The CreateProcess API executes the command
by using the parents process token. The Inetinfo process runs in the system
context, and thus commands that are executed with the run method are running in
the system context. This could be a security risk, especially for sites that
allow content editing and uploading.

This only applies to sites or applications that are running in-process. This is
the default in IIS 4. In IIS 5, the default is pooled out-of-process.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Server administrators can take these steps to limit the risk:

- Configure the IIS site or application to run in a separate process.

  For IIS 4: Open Properties for the Web site or virtual directory application,
  and click the Home Directory tab. Select Run in separate memory space
  (isolated process), and then click ok.

  For IIS 5: Open Properties for the Web site or virtual directory application,
  and then click the Home Directory tab. From the Application Protection
  dropdown list, choose either Medium (pooled) or High (isolated). For more
  information on these settings, see the IIS Help.

  If you want to continue to use the wshell object in an isolated Web
  application, you must set some registry keys. For additional information,

  Base:

  Q221081 HOWTO: Use Windows Script Host Scripts as CGI Scripts

- Unregister the wshell object.

  To do this, execute the following from a command line:

  "regsvr32 -u &lt;path&gt;\Wshom.ocx" (without the quotation marks)

  The &lt;path&gt; is usually %SYSTEMROOT%\System32
