SUMMARY
=======

The Logging ID is a unique alpa-numeric identifier that is generated for each
MSN Companion.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If an MSN Companion unit experiences any errors during the day, it uploads the
error list to the MSN Companion Error Log each night during nightly management
and tags each error with this Logging ID. The Error Log allows the MSN Companion
team to track problems as they begin to appear, and to fix them as soon as
possible.

When you call Technical Support with a problem that they can't easily diagnose,
it is sometimes helpful for the Technical Support team to look up the error logs
for your unit to see the exact errors that are occurring. Since the member id is
not recorded in the error logs, Technical Support will need the Logging ID in
order to see the corresponding errors.

Note: the Logging ID is not useful for diagnosing problems during initial setup.
The Logging ID is generated the first time the MSN Companion dials up for
nightly management after initial setup.

How to get the Logging ID
-------------------------

1. Turn on the MSN Companion and immediately click do not connect.

2. On the main troubleshooting page click I have some other problem that isn't
  described above.

3. On the contact technical support page click product info.

4. The logging ID is listed on the product information page.

  Typically it's only necessary to read off the first 10 characters of the
  logging id to get a unique match.
