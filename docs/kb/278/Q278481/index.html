Your Password

Note: the password for your account is kept on the MSN servers, and a copy of the

MSN.

There are rare circumstances when a password will be changed on the MSN servers.
If this is the case, you will not be able to log in to the MSN servers and you
will see an error screen. You will need to change the password that's stored in
the MSN Companion so that it matches the password on the MSN servers.
