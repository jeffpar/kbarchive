The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A poorly formatted inbound Internet message may cause an error in the
information store and start the Dr. Watson debugger. If you are experiencing the
problem addressed in this article, you may receive the following events:

  Event ID: 4116
  Source: MSExchangeIMC

  An error was returned from the messaging software the Internet Mail Service
  uses to process messages on the Microsoft Exchange Server. It is possible
  that the piece of mail being processed at the time will be returned to the
  sender as a failed delivery instead of being delivered. The message will be
  moved to the "BAD" folder, if possible, and the error is not a temporary
  error. Otherwise it will be retried when the service is restarted. Use the
  appropriate utilities found in the SUPPORT directory of your Exchange CD to
  view and manipulate messages that have been moved to the "BAD" folder

  Event ID: 3039
  Source: MSExchangeIMC

  The error 0x80040115 was encountered while trying to communicate with the
  message store. An attempt to refresh the connection will be made. If not
  successful, the service will be shut down.

  Data (Words) 0000: 00140667 80040115

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by an incorrectly formatted Internet message attribute.
If an Internet message received by the Internet Mail Service has an attribute of
CHARSET= " " in the header, the information store generates a Dr. Watson error
during inbound conversion.

======

version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.
