SUMMARY
=======

This section provides summaries of the games included with Human Body and
instructions for how to play them.

GAME DESCRIPTIONS
-----------------

Chatterbox - Mouth:

Object:

  Learn how the shape of your mouth affects the sounds you make.

How to Play:

Listen to the word as it's pronounced. Click the word if you want to hear it
again. Have Ms. Frizzle say the word by clicking the mouth shapes and moving
them onto the dark boxes in the thought balloon. The order you place them is the
order Ms. Frizzle says them. When you're ready, click "Say," and Ms. Frizzle
pronounces the sounds. If the word comes out wrong, try moving the sounds
around. If Ms. Frizzle says the word properly, you go on to another word.

Esophagus Puzzle - Esophagus:

Object:

  Reconstruct the picture by sliding or rotating puzzle pieces.

Easy Puzzle:

The picture that you are about to reconstruct splits into four pieces that
rotate. To reconstruct it, click any of the pieces. It will rotate once
(clockwise), but at the same time, another piece will rotate either once or
twice clockwise, or once counter-clockwise. The way the pieces interact with
each other will stay the same as long as you play but will be different the next
time you start the game.

Hard Puzzle:

The picture that you are about to reconstruct splits into 15 pieces that may
slide left and right or up and down into an empty space. The bottom- right piece
is missing and reappears when you complete the picture.

Down The Hatch - Stomach:

Object:

  Line up the four major meals of the day, across or down.

How to Play:

As pieces fall into the stomach, line them up so you have breakfast, lunch,
dinner, and dessert in a row going side to side, or up and down. The meals can
be in any order. Press the SPACEBAR, the UP ARROW key, or "5" on the numeric
keypad to rotate the piece as it falls. When you get all four meals in a row,
they are digested, filling in part of the puzzle next to the stomach. Some
puzzles have only a few pieces; others have more. Good luck and bon appetit!

Tunnel Vision - Small Intestine:

Object:

  Make a path out of tunnel pieces so that the ball can move to the opening at
  the end of the small intestine.

How to Play:

You can start your path anywhere, but your goal is a path that connects with the
opening at the end of the intestine by the time the ball gets there. Click one
of the three pieces UNDER the word "Next" and move it to a spot on the board.
Click again to place it on the board. Continue this until you have a path that
leads to the end of the intestine. You can replace a piece by putting a new one
on top of it unless the ball has already rolled through the old piece. If the
ball goes off the board or reaches a dead-end, you lose.

Scoring:

You get 50 points for each piece the ball rolls over. If the ball rolls over a
plus sign (+), you get 100 extra points. If the ball rolls over an "x," you get
200 extra points.

Tunnel Vision - Large Intestine:

Object:

  Guide the class to the end of the large intestine by connecting the pieces as
  they appear.

How to Play:

Start creating your path before the kids start to move! Click the piece in the
"Next" box and move it to a spot on the board. Click again to place it on the
board. Soon, the class will follow the path you've made. If the path ends before
the exit, or runs into a dead-end, you lose. Be careful! The end of the
intestine moves around the board so make sure your path goes to the right place.
You can change you path by putting a new piece on top of an old one and
continuing from there. After you've made a complete path, click the kids to
freeze the end platform and make them go faster. Scoring:

You get 25 points for every new piece the kids go through, but you lose 30 points
if they go through a piece more than once. You lose 5 points if you replace an
old piece with a new one. You have to win to get on the high score list.

Liver Lever - Liver:

Object:

  Put the colored ball in the right tubes by changing the levers as the balls
  fall.

How to Play:

When the balls start falling, click the levers to change their paths. The goal is
to guide the balls into the tubes of the same color. Beneath each tube is the
number of balls you need to guide into that tube. Any ball that falls into the
gray tube will be sent back to the top of the screen. There are 50 balls of each
color at the start of the game and they drop from the top of the screen
randomly. After each level, the number of balls that has to go into each tube
increases. The game ends when you lose all of your balls without fulfilling all
of the quotas.

Kid'n'Around - Kidney:

Object:

  Help the school bus pass through the kidneys.

How to Play:

Using the arrow keys, move the school bus from nephron to nephron (nephrons are
the blue dots). You want to get the bus from the start through the car wash and
across to the other kidney. Watch the nephrons because they shrink and disappear
quickly. If the nephron gets too small or disappears the bus will fall off the
screen and you will have to start over again. You start with three buses, so
good luck!

Ticker Ball - Heart:

Object:

  Use the flippers to send the blue blood cells to the heart and the red blood
  cells to the body.

How to Play:

You start with three blue cells which fall, one at a time, from the left UPPER
CHAMBER. Click the mouse to move the flippers at the bottom of the ventricles.
As the ball bounces around, you get points for almost everything it hits. If you
send it to the lungs, you get the number of points that are lit. When a cell
goes to the lungs, it turns red and shoots back into play on the right side of
the heart. If you send a red cell to the body, you get double the number of
points that are lit.

Air Combat - Lungs:

Object:

  Defend the lung cells from viruses and nasty pollution.

How to Play:

As viruses and pollution enter the lungs, aim at them or a little below them with
the mouse and click to shoot an antidote that will destroy the invader. You can
shoot only at targets in the highlighted part of the lungs. Every time a bad
blob touches your lung cells, the cells shrink a little, until they are gone.
The orange anti-bodies can help repair the cells, so don't shoot these, or
you'll lose points. When all the lung cells are gone, the game is over.

Nose Puzzle - Nose:

Object:

  Reconstruct the picture by sliding or rotating puzzle pieces.

Easy puzzle:

The picture that you are about to reconstruct splits into four pieces that
rotate. To reconstruct it, click any of the pieces. It will rotate once
(clockwise), but at the same time, another piece will rotate either once or
twice clockwise, or once counter-clockwise. The way the pieces interact with
each other will stay the same as long as you play but will be different the next
time you start the game.

Hard puzzle:

The picture that you are about to reconstruct splits into 15 pieces that may
slide left and right or up and down into an empty space. The bottom-right piece
is missing and reappears when you complete the picture.

Crossed Wires - Brain:

Object:

  Find the pictures on the right that relate to those on the left.

How to Play:

The neurons are in two columns, left and right. Many impulses (the blue balls)
pass between them, moving randomly from side to side. Click a neuron in the left
column and one in the right column. If the two are related, such as a foot and a
shoe, you have a match, and both will stay face up. If they don't match, they'll
flip back over and a yellow shock moves from the left neuron to the right. The
shock will destroy any impulse it touches, so be careful! If you run out of
impulses before you make all the matches, the game is over.

Skin Puzzle - Skin:

Object:

  Reconstruct the picture by sliding or rotating puzzle pieces.

Easy puzzle:

The picture that you are about to reconstruct splits into four pieces that
rotate. To reconstruct it, click any of the pieces. It will rotate once
(clockwise), but at the same time, another piece will rotate either once or
twice clockwise, or once counter-clockwise. The way the pieces interact with
each other will stay the same as long as you play but will be different the next
time you start the game.

Hard puzzle:

The picture that you are about to reconstruct splits into 15 pieces that may
slide left and right or up and down into an empty space. The bottom-right piece
is missing and reappears when you complete the picture.

Skeleton Puzzle:

Object:

  Put the skeleton back together again.

How to Play:

The skeleton will fall apart when you click it. Try to reconstruct the skeleton
from its parts. Start from either the top or the bottom. Click Liz if you need
help. Click "Hint" if you need a hint.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For descriptions and information on how to play the games, click on the question
mark on the opening screen of each game.

Winning the Game:

To win the "game" you must first go to all 12 locations in Arnold's body. After
you have gone to all 12 body parts, return to either the nose, mouth, or skin.
Click the keyhole to receive either a feather (nose), jalapeno pepper (mouth),
or water (skin). Click that object and drop it on the windshield to initiate the
escape sequence from Arnold's body. You will either be sneezed out, coughed out,
or sweat out.
