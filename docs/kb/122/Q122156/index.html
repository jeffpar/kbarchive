SUMMARY
=======

You can include TrueType fonts when you save a PowerPoint for Windows
presentation. This is useful if you want to display or print the presentation
from another computer that does not have the same TrueType fonts installed.

Each TrueType font you save with your presentation increases the file size of
your presentation, so you may not want to include the TrueType fonts that others
usually have. The TTEMBED.INI file allows you to specify whether or not a
certain TrueType font should be saved with the presentation. By default, it
specifies that the TrueType fonts that ship with the Windows Operating
Environment (Arial, Courier New, Times New Roman, Symbol, and Wingdings) should
not be saved with your presentation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To save fonts with your presentation
------------------------------------

1. In PowerPoint, choose Save from the File menu. (If this presentation has
  already been saved, choose Save As instead.)

2. Type a filename in the File Name box.

3. Select (place an 'x' in) the "Embed True Type Fonts" check box.

4. Choose OK.

Every TrueType font that the presentation uses will be saved with the file except
those listed in the TTEMBED.INI file. A default TTEMBED.INI looks like this:

  [EMBEDDING]
  Arial=0
  Arial Bold=0
  Arial Bold Italic=0
  Arial Italic=0
  Courier New=0
  Courier New Bold=0
  Courier New Bold Italic=0
  Courier New Italic=0
  Symbol=0
  Times New Roman=0
  Times New Roman Bold=0
  Times New Roman Bold Italic=0
  Times New Roman Italic=0
  Wingdings=0

To allow PowerPoint to save one or more of these fonts
------------------------------------------------------

1. Save your work and exit PowerPoint.

2. Open TTEMBED.INI in a text editor such as Notepad. TTEMBED.INI is located in
  your Windows directory.

3. Change the number next to each TrueType font you would like PowerPoint to
  save from a 0 to a 1.

4. Save TTEMBED.INI.

To prevent PowerPoint from saving one or more unlisted fonts
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Open Control Panel and double-click Fonts.

2. Look on the list of installed fonts for the font or fonts you want to add to
  TTEMBED.INI. Write down the description exactly as it appears on the list.
  For example:

  TestFont Bold (TrueType)

3. Close Control Panel.

4. Open the TTEMBED.INI file in a text editor such as Notepad.

5. Add an entry to the end of the file similar to:

  "TestFont Bold=0" (without the quotation marks)

  NOTE: Do not put the word (TrueType) after the font name. You will need to put
  a separate entry for each font weight (for example, TestFont Bold, TestFont
  Italic, and so forth).

6. Save the file.

NOTE: Some fonts are manufactured and copyrighted in such a way that they cannot
be saved with a presentation. If you receive a warning saying that a certain
font cannot be saved because of a license restriction, there is nothing you can
do to TTEMBED.INI that will allow you to save this font with your presentation.
