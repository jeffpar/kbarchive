The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The National Semiconductor NE4100 InfoMover PCMCIA network card works correctly
with most laptops. However, if you use this card in the AST Ascentia 900N laptop
(portable) computer, you may be unable to log on to busier networks under
Windows for Workgroups.

CAUSE
=====

The AST Ascentia 900N uses the relatively rare VLSI PCMCIA controller chip. The
AST Ascentia 900N also ships with the Cardsoft 3.1 PCMCIA card and socket
services, which is the first card to support the VLSI chip. However, Windows for
Workgroups runs well on the Ascentia with other PCMCIA network cards installed,
runs well in most cases with Cardsoft software, and runs in other laptop
computers with the NE4100 installed; therefore, Microsoft has been unable to
determine which element causes the network logon problems under Windows for
Workgroups.

STATUS
======

National Semiconductor is aware of this problem and will supply more information
as it becomes available. You can contact National Semiconductor at (800)
231-6072.
