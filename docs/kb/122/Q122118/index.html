SYMPTOMS
========

During debugging it is common to find bugs and make minor code changes as you
continue debugging. However, editing source code while in the middle of a
debugging session may cause new or existing "Break At Location" breakpoints to
become misaligned with their corresponding instructions. ("Break At Location" is
the default type if the breakpoints are set using the toolbar button in the
Visual C++ development environment.)

If, after editing, the source file remains the same in terms of line positions,
then breakpoints will appear as expected. However, if the source file changes in
terms of line positions, new breakpoint indicators (the red dots) will shift
position with respect to their corresponding instruction by the number of lines
added or deleted before each breakpoint.

Alternately, the red dot breakpoint indicators for pre-existing breakpoints will
follow their corresponding instructions during editing, but after the rebuild
warning, the program execution continues and the pre-existing breakpoints are
hit, the yellow current instruction pointer will be out of sync with the
corresponding instruction by the number of lines added or deleted before each
breakpoint.

CAUSE
=====

The debugger does not track line number changes during editing, so it does not
update new breakpoint and the current instruction pointer indicators
accordingly.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
