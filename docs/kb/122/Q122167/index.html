SYMPTOMS
========

You are unable to run or install Microsoft Remote Access Services (RAS) when the
Intel CCCOMM.DRV communications driver is running in place of the Windows
COMM.DRV driver.

CAUSE
=====

By default, the installation programs for Intel PCMCIA data and fax modems
disable the Windows COMM.DRV communications driver and install the proprietary
Intel CCCOMM.DRV driver in its place. ("CCC" in the driver filename stands for
credit card communications.)

The Intel CCCOMM.DRV driver enhances the performance of Intel cards when you are
running the Intel fax software supplied with Intel modems. However, CCCOMM.DRV
is unnecessary for other communications utilities, such as Windows Terminal, and
it actually conflicts with the operation of Microsoft RAS.

RESOLUTION
==========

Intel offers an alternative MODEM.INF file that loads the Windows COMM.DRV file
instead of CCCOMM.DRV when you run Microsoft RAS on your Intel PCMCIA data and
fax modems.

You can obtain the self-expanding MODINF.EXE file from the Intel bulletin board
service (BBS) at (503) 645-6275.

After you obtain the updated MODEM.INF file, you should follow its installation
instructions precisely. Specifically, you must run the fix in your Windows
SYSTEM subdirectory to replace the original MODEM.INF file. You should pick only
your particular card from the list, which appears in the RAS Setup Configure
dialog box. If you select the incorrect Intel modem, or if you try to simply
replace the CCCOMM.DRV file with COMM.DRV without obtaining the fix from Intel,
a

  Serial Communications Overflow

error occurs when you try to dial from RAS.

According to Intel technical support, you can find the version number (called the
"order number") for your modem under the support phone number on the PCMCIA card
label. If no order number is printed on the label for your Intel data and fax
14.4K baud modem, you probably have version 6830; in this case, select 6830 in
the RAS Setup Configuration dialog box.
