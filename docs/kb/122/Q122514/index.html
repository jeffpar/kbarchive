-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running an MS-DOS-based application from an icon in Windows 95, the
MS-DOS window remains open with the text "Finished - &lt;Application Name&gt;"
appearing on the title bar after the application has finished executing.

CAUSE
=====

The MS-DOS window remains open so that you can see any messages, such as errors,
that may be generated by the MS-DOS-based application. This window appears for
any MS-DOS-based application that generates output.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can change the program properties for the MS-DOS-based application so that
it closes on exit. To do this:

1. Use the right (secondary) mouse button to click the icon for the MS-DOS-based
  application.

2. Click Properties.

3. Click the Program tab.

4. Click Close On Exit to select that option.

5. Click OK to accept the settings.

The MS-DOS-based application window should now close after the application has
finished executing. You must change this setting for each MS-DOS-based
application individually--there is no way to set this option globally.

Note, however, that you can set this option globally for all MS-DOS-based
programs that do not already have their own PIF (program information file). To
do this, create a default PIF with the setting listed above. For information
about creating a default PIF, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q131877 How to Create Default PIF for MS-DOS-Based Programs

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you are running a batch file, you can close the MS-DOS window by adding the
following lines to the end of the batch file:

  echo off
  cls
