-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 2.0, 4.0, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

While the Microsoft Foundations Classes versions 3.0 and later that ship with
Visual C++ versions 2.0 and later do support multiple threads, only one external
thread may be attached to a _USRDLL.

MORE INFORMATION
================

_USRDLLs are MFC DLLs that are built as stand-alone DLLs. They can be used with
non-MFC applications. They are not closely tied to the application that calls
them and contain their own CWinApp derived class.

During the initialization of a _USRDLL, MFC allocates per-thread local data using
Thread Local Storage (TLS). Because this is done only during the
DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, only data for the attaching thread is allocated. MFC
_USRDLLs do not handle the DLL_THREAD_ATTACH case where additional threads are
created, or existing threads other than the one that originally attached to the
DLL.

Because most MFC 3.0 objects end up using TLS, accessing most MFC objects from a
secondary thread created outside the _USRDLL will cause access violations. This
is because each thread that uses MFC must be started with AfxBeginThread so that
this TLS data can be initialized.

This is a change from MFC version 2.0 that shipped with Visual C++ version 1.0
for Windows NT, where no TLS data was used by MFC. It was possible in MFC
version 2.0 to access _USRDLLs with multiple threads, as long as only one thread
accessed the DLL at a time. (This could be accomplished by using
EnterCriticalSection() or a semaphore.)

It is still possible to access the _USRDLL from multiple threads created in the
application if only one thread accesses the _USRDLL at a time and each thread
loads and unloads the _USRDLL. TLS data will be created for the current thread
each time the DLL is loaded.

Threads created inside the _USRDLL by creating CWinThread derived objects will
correctly create TLS data for those threads and work correctly.

_AFXDLL, which is closely tied to the executable, does not have these
restrictions.
