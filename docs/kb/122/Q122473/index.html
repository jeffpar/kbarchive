- Your CD-Rom drive is drive D

If your hard disk drive, destination folder, Windows folder, or CD-ROM drive

Steps for Windows or Windows for Workgroups, Versions 3.x
---------------------------------------------------------

If you are running Microsoft Windows 3.x, follow these steps. When copying files,
exit Windows and copy from the MS-DOS command prompt. Allow MS-DOS to overwrite
any files it finds already on your hard drive.

1. Create a folder named C:\Bktball on your hard drive.

  For example, type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt and press ENTER
  at the end of the line:

  "md c:\bktball" (without the quotation marks)

2. Create a folder named C:\Bktball\Daily.

3. Copy all the files in the D:\App folder to C:\Bktball folder.

  For example, to copy Medvdll.dll, type the following at the MS-DOS command
  prompt and press ENTER at the end of the line:

  "copy d:\app\medvdll.dll c:\bktball" (without the quotation marks)

4. Copy the following files from the D:\ to C:\Bktball folder:

  - Readme.ico
  - Readme.txt

5. Copy the file Text.m11 from the D:\Baggage folder to the C:\Bktball folder.

6. Copy all the files in the D:\Daily folder to the C:\Bktball\Daily folder.

7. Copy all the files in the D:\Zzsystem folder to C:\Windows\System folder.

8. Copy all the files in the D:\Viewer folder to C:\Windows\System folder.

9. If necessary, remove the read-only attribute from all the files in the
  C:\Bktball and C:\Baseball\Daily folders.

10. Use a text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad, to make the following changes
  to the Bktball.ini file, which is located in the Windows folder. If the
  Bktball.ini file does not already exist, create one in the Windows folder
  with these entries:

      [bktball]
      idxpath=C:\BKTBALL\ 
      cd=D:\ 
      workpath=C:\BKTBALL\ 
      viewerpath=C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\ 
      rlefix=0

      [sound]
      installed=1
      fxsounds=1
      music=1
      random=1
      button=1

11. Use a text editor to make the following changes to the Mssports.ini file,
  which is located in the Windows folder. If the Mssports.ini file does not
  already exist, create one in the Windows folder with these entries:

      Key=&lt;special characters, see below&gt;
      Path=C:\BKTBALL\DAILY

      [online]
      ViewerPath=C:\VIEWER\ 

  NOTE: To insert the special characters after Key=, use the following method:

  Make sure the NUMLOCK key is on and place the cursor to the right of the Key=
  entry. Press and hold down the ALT key, and type the numbers from the
  numeric keypad as shown below. Be sure to release the ALT key after typing
  each sequence of numbers:
