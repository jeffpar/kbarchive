SUMMARY
=======

This article contains the complete text of the README.TXT file included with the
Windows 95 Client for Microsoft SNA Server. It describes how to obtain the files
for installing the Windows 95 Client for Microsoft SNA Server.

NOTE: The Windows 95 client is included with SNA Server 3.0 and SNA Server 2.11
sp1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

September 1995

This note contains information on how to obtain the files for installing the
Windows 95 Client for Microsoft SNA Server.

A. General Information

A.1. Obtaining the Windows 95 Client for SNA Server

The Windows 95 client files are available for downloading in a self-extracting
file, named SNAWIN95.EXE. This self-extracting file may be found along with the
README1.TXT file you are currently reading. These files have been placed in
several locations for the convenience of our customers. If the files have become
separated and you need to locate the SNAWIN95.EXE file, see Section C at the end
of this file.

Note that SNAWIN95.EXE is less than 3 megabytes in size (in a compressed
format).

A.2. Operating system considerations

The Windows 95 client of SNA Server can be installed on computers running
Microsoft Windows 95 or later.

For client computers running Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 or
later, you can install either the Windows 95 client or the Windows NT client
(that was included with SNA Server versions 2.1 and 2.11), but not both at the
same time. The Windows 95 client is supported by Microsoft SNA Server version
2.1 or later. The Windows 95 client provides full support for existing 32-bit
SNA Server applications, using CPIC, APPC, LUA and FMI. Support for 16-bit SNA
applications on Windows 95 is provided by the Win3x client included with SNA
Server versions 2.1 and 2.11.

A.3. Licensing

Each Windows 95 client must be properly licensed to access an SNA Server. Client
licensing options on an SNA Server include Per Seat or Per Server.

For more information on licensing, see the SNA Server version 2.11 README.WRI
file, Enhancements Guide, and Planning Guide.

B. Downloading and Extracting the Files

The Windows 95 Client for SNA Server can be installed from a shared network
drive, or from your local drive. To download the Windows 95 client and prepare
the files for installation, follow these steps:

1. Create a folder from which to install the Windows 95 client files. (Share
  this folder with the appropriate users if you want users to install from a
  shared network drive).

2. Download SNAWIN95.EXE (see Section C for locations) to the folder created in
  the previous step.

3. To expand the files, open a command box (MS-DOS session), change to the
  folder where you downloaded the SNAWIN95.EXE file, and type

  "snawin95.exe -d" (without the quotation marks)

This will expand the files for the Windows 95 Client of SNA Server into the
current folder. The -d switch must be used because it enables the creation of
the appropriate subdirectories. When you issue the preceding command, a message
will popup to remind you to use the -d switch; it will also provide the option
of cancelling the self-extraction if you did not use the -d switch.

For setup instructions, and additional information about the Windows 95 Client
for SNA Server, please see the README.HLP file that will be copied in Step 3
above to your local drive in the &lt;snaroot&gt;\system folder.

A shortcut to the README.HLP file is also created at the time you run the Setup
program, and is called SNA Client for Windows 95 Release Notes. This icon will
be located on the program menu in the folder created for the SNA Client for
Windows 95. To print all topics in the Release Notes, select the book icon in
the Contents window and choose the Print button.
