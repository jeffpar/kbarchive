-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
- Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform a DriveSpace operation that requires Windows 95 to restart,
Windows 95 may be unable to restart in mini-Windows mode, causing the operation
to fail. You may receive an error message similar to one of the following
messages, or your computer may stop responding (hang).

- DrvSpace caused a General Protection Fault in module W31SPACE.EXE

- DrvSpace caused a Page Fault in module W31SPACE.EXE

- Error Loading PROGMAN.EXE

- Error Loading GDI.EXE

- Error Loading USER.EXE

- Error loading VGA.DRV

- Cannot start Windows in standard mode

- Segment load failure in W31space.exe

- Standard Mode: Bad fault in MSDos Extender

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the files in the hidden Failsafe.drv folder or the
Mini.cab file in the Windows\System folder are damaged. These files are required
for Windows 95 to restart in mini-Windows mode.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Restart your computer at an MS-DOS prompt. To do so, press the F8 key when
  you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, and then choose Safe Mode Command
  Prompt Only from the Startup menu.

2. Backup your Autoexec.bat and Config.sys files, and then copy the Autoexec.bat
  and Config.sys files from the hidden Failsafe.drv folder on the physical boot
  drive (usually either drive C or the host for drive C if drive C is
  compressed) to the root directory of drive C, replacing the files that are
  already there. To backup your Autoexec.bat and Config.sys files and then copy
  the files, type the following commands, pressing ENTER after each line

  " copy &lt;drive&gt;:\autoexec.bat autoexec.xxx
  copy &lt;drive&gt;:\config.sys config.xxx
  copy &lt;drive&gt;:\failsafe.drv\autoexec.bat c:\ /y
  copy &lt;drive&gt;:\failsafe.drv\config.sys c:\ /y " (without the quotation
  marks)

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the physical boot drive.

3. Remove the Failsafe.drv folder from the physical boot drive (usually either
  drive C or the host for drive C if drive C is compressed).

  IMPORTANT NOTE: The Failsafe.drv folder may contain drivers necessary for
  troubleshooting if this procedure does not correct the problem. You should
  copy the Failsafe.drv folder and all its contents to another drive or folder
  before deleting it.

  To remove the Failsafe.drv folder, type the following command at an MS- DOS
  command prompt

  " deltree &lt;drive&gt;:\failsafe.drv " (without the quotation marks)

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the physical boot drive.


1. Copy the Mini.cab file from your original Windows 95 disks or CD-ROM to the
  Windows\System folder.

  NOTE: The Mini.cab file is located on disk 1 of the standard 3.5-inch Windows
  95 disks, or in the Win95 folder on the Windows 95 CD-ROM. You can copy this
  file using Windows Explorer or the COPY command. You do not need to use the
  EXTRACT command with this file.

  If you are using Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 and you do not have access to
  your original Windows 95 disks or CD-ROM, you can extract the Mini.cab file
  from the Microsoft Plus! disks or CD-ROM. The Mini.cab file is located in the
  Plus_2.cab file on the CD-ROM, or in the Plus_1.cab file on the disks. For
  information about using the EXTRACT command, please see the following article
  in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q129605 How to Extract Original Compressed Windows Files

2. Restart Windows 95 normally.

3. Run DriveSpace and try the operation again.
