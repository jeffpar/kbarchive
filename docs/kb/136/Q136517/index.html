SUMMARY
=======

When you delete a file in Windows Explorer or My Computer, the file appears in
the Recycle Bin. The file remains in the Recycle Bin until you empty the Recycle
Bin or restore the file.

Older files are also removed from the Recycle Bin when newer files are deleted
and the Recycle Bin exceeds the maximum size allocated in Recycle Bin
properties.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Each hard disk contains a hidden folder named Recycled. This folder contains
files deleted in Windows Explorer or My Computer, or in Windows- based
programs.

When you delete a file, the complete path and file name is stored in a hidden
file called Info or Info2 (Windows 98) in the Recycled folder. The deleted file
is renamed, using the following syntax:

  D&lt;original drive letter of file&gt;&lt;#&gt;.&lt;original extension&gt;

Examples:

  New file name:

  Dc1.txt = (C drive, second file deleted, a .txt file)

  INFO file path:

  C:\Windows\Desktop\Books.txt

  New file name:

  De7.doc = (E drive, eighth file deleted, a .doc file)

  INFO file path:

  E:\Winword\Letter to Rosemary.doc

Each drive has a Recycled folder. Files deleted from compliant programs are moved
to the Recycled folder on the drive from which they are deleted. Double-clicking
the Recycle Bin icon displays the folder listing of deleted files available for
restoration.

Clicking a file and choosing Restore causes the original path to be read from the
INFO file, and the file to be renamed and restored to its original path.

Damaged or Deleted INFO File
----------------------------

If the INFO file is damaged or deleted, no files appear in the Recycle Bin.
However, the renamed files still exist in the Recycled folder. Even though the
files in the Recycled folder have been renamed, they are not changed in any
other way. For example, a text file is still viewable as a text file. To restore
such a file, you can manually search for the file in the folder and rename it.

If the INFO file is deleted, it is re-created when you restart Windows. If the
Recycle Bin becomes damaged and stops functioning, deleting the hidden INFO file
in the Recycle folder and restarting Windows may enable you to again access
files in the Recycle Bin. The INFO file is a hidden file. To delete the INFO
file follow these steps:

1. Open a command prompt window

2. Type "cd recycled" (without the quotation marks)

3. Type "attrib -h inf*" (without the quotation marks)

4. Type "del info" (without the quotation marks)

Damaged Files in Recycled Folder
--------------------------------

No files may appear in the Recycle Bin if the files in the Recycled folder are
damaged. If this is the case, create a copy of the Recycled\ Desktop.ini file in
another folder, and then delete the entire contents of the Recycled folder.
Then, restore the Desktop.ini file to the Recycled folder. Note that doing this
deletes all files in the Recycle Bin.

If the Desktop.ini file is not present or is also damaged, it can be recreated by
adding the following information to a blank Desktop.ini file:

       [.ShellClassInfo]
       CLSID={645FF040-5081-101B-9F08-00AA002F954E}

Damaged Recycled Folder
-----------------------

The Recycled folder itself can become damaged. Files are moved to the folder and
the Recycle Bin on the desktop appears full, but you cannot view the contents
and the Empty The Recycle Bin command is unavailable. Deleting this folder and
restarting Windows will re-create this folder and restore functionality:

1. Restart to a command prompt.

2. Type "attrib -s -h recycled" (without the quotation marks).

3. Type "del recycled" (without the quotation marks).

4. Restart the computers.
