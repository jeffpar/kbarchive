-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

How a Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) server entry responds when a conflict
occurs varies depending on three different instances:

- State of the entries

- Ownership of the entries

- Addresses of the entries

MORE INFORMATION
================

Conflict Between 2 Replicas
---------------------------

- If Replica1 and Replica2 are Tombstoned (indicated by a cross in the status
  field), Replica1 is replaced.

- If Replica1 is Tombstoned and Replica2 is active, Replica1 is replaced.

- If Replica1 is Active and Replica2 is Tombstoned, Replica1 will be kept if:

   - Replica1 and Replica2 come from different WINS servers.

   - If they have the same owner, Replica2 will be kept.

- If Replica1 and Replica2 are active, Replica2 will be kept.

Conflict Between Owned Entry and
Replica with Same or Different IP Address
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

- If Address1 is Tombstoned or released and Replica1 is Tombstoned, Address1 is
  replaced.

- If Address1 is Tombstoned or released and Replica1 is active, Address1 is
  replaced.

- If Address1 is active and Replica1 is Tombstoned, Address1 is kept.

- If Address1 and Replica1 are active, Replica1 will be kept. Address1 will be
  told to release the name, and Replica1 will increment its version stamp to
  cause repropogation.

If a Unique Name Conflicts with a Group Name
--------------------------------------------

The Group entry is kept.

If There Is a Conflict Between Two Internet Group Names
-------------------------------------------------------

- If Group1 is Tombstoned or released and Group2 is Tombstoned, Group1 is
  replaced.

- If Group1 is Tombstoned or released and Group2 is active, Group1 is replaced.

- If Group1 is active and Group2 is Tombstoned, Group1 is kept.

- If Group1 and Group2 are active, A superset of both groups is maintained.

If a Multihomed Record Conflicts
--------------------------------

- If a multihomed replica clashes with a tombstoned or released database entry,
  the entry in the database is replaced with the replica.

- If a tombstoned multihomed replica conflicts with an active entry with the
  same owner, the entry is replaced. However, if the active entry is owned by a
  different owner, then it is not replaced.

- If an active multihomed entry conflicts with an active unique/multihomed
  replica in the same database, it is replaced. If the owner is different, it
  is not replaced.
