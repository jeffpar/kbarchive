SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the "Not Read" notification message generated by a
Microsoft Exchange Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A Microsoft Exchange client user can request notification when a message is
read. The Exchange Server then sends the message originator a notification
message when the recipient reads the message.

The notification message has a subject line with the following format:

  Read: &lt;Original Message Subject&gt;

The message body of the notification message has the following format:

  Your message

        To:       Test User
        Subject:  &lt;Original Message Subject&gt;
        Sent:     8/22/95 1:27:33 PM

  was read on 8/22/95 1:30:16 PM

Occasionally, when an Exchange user sends a message with Read-Receipt
notification turned on, the notification message returned has a subject line
with following format:

  Not Read: &lt;Original Message Subject&gt;

The body of the message contains the following information:

  Your message

     To:       Test User
     Subject:  Test of Read Notification
     Sent:     8/22/95 1:14:24PM

  has not yet been read. It has either been deleted or moved to a place
  where it can no longer be tracked. As a result, no further
  notifications will be sent.

NOTE: The notification message will not be sent if the message is deleted on the
server until the deleted folder is emptied. The feature to empty the deleted
folder is set by default. To change the feature, select Options from the Tools
menu. Then, under the General tab, select the Empty the 'Deleted Items' Folder
Upon Exiting check box.

The above notification message can be generated if the message has been deleted
before it was read or if the recipient has defined a rule in the Inbox Assistant
that moves the message into a folder located in a .PST file on a local machine,
before the message was read.

The Microsoft Exchange Information Store service is responsible for tracking
messages to generate the notification messages. The folders in a user's local
.PST file cannot be tracked by the information store and hence the "Not Read"
notification is generated.
