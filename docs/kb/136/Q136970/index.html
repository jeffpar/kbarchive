-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Transferring large amounts of data from a Windows NT 3.5 or 3.51 computer to
another computer using TCP/IP over intermediate devices may fail.

CAUSE
=====

Some intermediate devices are incapable of handling large packet sizes, and
don't respond correctly when receiving them.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install the fix mentioned below.

PMTU Discovery Overview
-----------------------

Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51 use PMTU discovery as described in RFC1191. When a
connection is established, the two hosts involved exchange their TCP maximum
segment size (MSS) values. The smaller of the two MSS values is used for the
connection. The MSS for a system is usually the MTU (Maximum Transfer Unit) at
the link layer minus 40 bytes for the IP and TCP headers.

When TCP segments are destined to a non-local network, the Don't Fragment bit is
set in the IP header. Any router or media along the path may have an MTU that
differs from that of the two hosts. If a media is encountered with an MTU that
is too small for the IP datagram being routed, the router will attempt to
fragment the datagram accordingly. Upon attempting to do so, it will find that
the Don't Fragment bit in the IP header is set. At this point, the router should
inform the sending host with an ICMP destination unreachable message that the
datagram can't be forwarded further without fragmentation.

Most routers will also specify the MTU that is allowed for the next hop by
putting the value for it in the low-order 16 bits of the ICMP header field that
is labeled "unused" in the ICMP specification. See RFC1191, section 4, for the
format of this message. Upon receiving this ICMP error message, TCP adjusts its
MSS for the connection to the specified MTU minus the TCP and IP header size, so
that any further packets sent on the connection will be no larger than the
maximum size that can traverse the path without fragmentation.

Using The Largest Possible MTU For Each Path Optimizes Efficiency
-----------------------------------------------------------------

PMTU discovery is enabled by default, but can be controlled by adding the
following value to the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE

  \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\tcpip\parameters
  \EnablePMTUDiscovery (REG_DWORD, 0=disabled, 1=enabled)

When PMTU discovery is disabled, an MTU of 576 bytes is used for all non-local
destination IP addresses. (The TCP MSS=536).

PMTU Black Hole Detection in Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51
----------------------------------------------------

A number of vendors sell routers and other intermediate devices that are not
compliant. Instead of returning ICMP destination unreachable messages to the
originating host, they may silently discard IP datagrams that are too large to
be passed on to the next media in a path. These devices are referred to as
"Black Hole Routers."

Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51 TCP/IP can be configured to attempt to discover these
Black Hole Routers, and adapt the PMTU to be small enough to pass through them.
A registry value can be added to enable PMTU Black Hole detection:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\tcpip\parameters
  \EnablePMTUBHDetect (REG_DWORD, 0=disabled, 1=enabled)

If this value is not present (default), then PMTU Black Hole detection is not
enabled.

When PMTUBHDetect is enabled, after a TCP segment is retransmitted 1/2 of
TCPMaxDataRetransmissions (another registry parameter, default=5) times without
being acknowledged, the Don't Fragment bit will be cleared on the remainder of
the retransmission attempts. If the segment is acknowledged as a result, the MSS
will be decreased, and the Don't Fragment bit will be set in future IP datagrams
sent on that connection.

STATUS
======

Microsoft Product Support engineers have encountered a number of routers and
other intermediate devices that silently drop large frames, even when the Don't
Fragment bit is not set. Because the existing Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51 TCP/IP
PMTU Black Hole Detection algorithm does not detect and adapt for these devices,
customers who encountered problems had no choice but to disable PMTU detection.
Therefore, Microsoft has made the following change:

  When PMTUBHDetect is enabled, after a TCP segment is retransmitted 1/2 of
  TCPMaxDataRetransmissions (default=5 still) times without being acknowledged,
  an MSS of 536 bytes (MTU=576) will be used on the remainder of the
  retransmission attempts. The Don't Fragment bit will not be set on any of
  these 536 byte segments. 536 bytes is the smallest MTU normally encountered,
  and since the Don't Fragment bit is not set, the packet can be further
  fragmented if necessary.

This change should result in more reliable transfer of large files over wide-area
networks with a mixture of intermediate devices, such as the Internet. The
modified TCPIP.SYS file is available from Microsoft Product Support.


NOTE: PMTUBHDetect still defaults to 0 (disabled), so in order to take advantage
of this feature the value must be added to the registry shown above, and set to
1.

settings, see Knowledge Base article Q120642.
