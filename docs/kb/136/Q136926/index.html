SUMMARY
=======

This article provides tips to help you modify a SQL query to make it run faster.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some things to consider:

- Joins slow down SQL queries. If you don't really need a FROM table, remove
  it.

- If the query involves joins, make sure there are indexes that can be used to
  perform the join. That is, for "WHERE T1.F1 = T2.F2," make sure there are
  indexes on T1.F1 and/or T2.F2. (If you have indexes on both, the query
  optimizer will choose the one it thinks is better.)

- Sorts slow down SQL queries. Sorts are performed to execute ORDER BY, GROUP
  BY, SELECT DISTINCT, and UNION DISTINCT.

   - Do not use SELECT DISTINCT unless you really need it. Note that if you
     have a GROUP BY, you don't also need a SELECT DISTINCT.

   - Do not use UNION DISTINCT unless you really need it. Note that if you
     don't specify ALL or DISTINCT after UNION, the default is DISTINCT, so you
     need to explicitly say UNION ALL.

   - Do not specify both GROUP BY and ORDER BY. If specify both and they are
     identical, the optimizer will automatically remove the ORDER BY.

- Specify only those fields you need in the SELECT clause. When the query
  engine creates temporary intermediate result tables, it has to include all
  the fields you specified in the SELECT clause, plus any that are referenced
  in the WHERE clause if they are needed for later execution. For complex
  queries, a field in the SELECT clause could be copied from one table to
  another several times. This can especially affect performance if the query
  includes memo fields.

- To take advantage of Rushmore optimization, ensure that filter conditions in
  the WHERE clause are Rushmore optimizable. You don't always need to make sure
  every condition is Rushmore optimizable, but make sure the Rushmore
  optimizable ones will greatly limit the rows from each source table.

For more information about the Rushmore technology and how to optimize your
applications, please see the Visual FoxPro 3.0 Developer's Guide, chapter 17,
"Optimizing Applications."
