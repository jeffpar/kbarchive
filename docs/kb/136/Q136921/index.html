SUMMARY
=======

You can create unique and sequential keys in Visual FoxPro by using two of
Visual FoxPro's new features: Stored Procedures and Default Values.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To see an example showing how to create unique and sequential keys, please look
at the TasTrade sample application located in the Vfp\Samples\Mainsamp
directory. In this sample, the NewID() stored procedure has been written and
stored in the TasTrade database. The following text is taken from the "Behind
the Scenes" feature of the Tastrade sample:

The NewID() stored procedure creates unique IDs in the system. It returns the
default value for the primary keys for the Supplier, Products, Employee,
Category, Shippers, and Orders tables.

Code in NewID() opens Setup.dbf, looks for table alias in the Key_name field,
reads the current value of the Value field, increments it by 1, and then writes
it back to Setup.dbf. The value that was read from the Value field before
incrementing is then returned as the primary key value for a record.

Note that the NewID() stored procedure is also designed to accept an alias as a
parameter. The same technique could then be used to maintain incrementing values
that were not being used as primary keys. An example of this is the order_number
record, which is used to generate order numbers for the Orders table.

You can modify stored procedures by first opening the database with the OPEN
DATABASE command, and then using the MODIFY PROCEDURES command to bring up an
editing window. Alternatively, you can use the MODIFY DATABASE command, and then
click the Stored Procedures button on the toolbar.

The code for NewID() is as follows:

     FUNCTION NewID(tcAlias)
       LOCAL lcAlias, ;
             lcID, ;
             lcOldReprocess, ;
             lnOldArea

       lnOldArea = SELECT()

       IF PARAMETERS() &lt; 1
         lcAlias = UPPER(ALIAS())
       ELSE
         lcAlias = UPPER(tcAlias)
       ENDIF

       lcID = ""
       lcOldReprocess = SET('REPROCESS')

       *-- Lock until user presses Esc
       SET REPROCESS TO AUTOMATIC

       IF !USED("SETUP")
         USE tastrade!setup IN 0
       ENDIF
       SELECT setup

       IF SEEK(lcAlias, "setup", "key_name")
         IF RLOCK()
           lcID = setup.value
           REPLACE setup.value WITH ;
                   STR(VAL(ALLT(lcID)) + 1, LEN(setup.value))
           UNLOCK
         ENDIF
       ENDIF

       SELECT (lnOldArea)
       SET REPROCESS TO lcOldReprocess

       RETURN lcID
     ENDFUNC
