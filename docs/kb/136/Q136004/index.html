The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The file locking timing method used when you run multiple External Mail programs
against asynchronously connected postoffices (POs) with two way connection
enabled can result in inaccurate non-delivery reports (NDRs) or possible
duplicate mail.

The above problem can have the following symptoms:

- Misleading NDRs and SYSTEM.LOG entries:

  

     

  External program has detected a mail problem.
     Message data:
       From: /USERONE
       Date: 07-06-95
       Time: 09:01
       Subject: RE: Testing
     [005] Mail retry count exceeded sending to:  MAILNET  /MAILPO
     [016] Message was not sent due to missing message file.
     Missing file is O:MAI\MA4\0006A044.MAI.

  However, the SENT.LOG file shows that the message was successfully delivered
  prior to this attempt.

- Messages are received a second time with only the subject line.

- Duplicate messages.

With the original file locking method, after sending mail, the MBG .OLK file was
deleted before the ATT, MAI, and other associated P1 files were deleted. As a
result, the MBG file would be unlocked too quickly. Another External Mail
program may attempt to lock the mailbag and process the mail before the previous
External Mail program had cleaned up properly, resulting in the above errors.
