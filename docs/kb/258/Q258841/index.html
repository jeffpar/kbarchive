SUMMARY
=======

KybdStck.exe is a sample that demonstrates how to use API functions to navigate
through the Keyboard Layout Stack that is used for multi-language support.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  KybdStck.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/vfox60/sample/60/w9x2k/en-us/kybdstck.exe)

Release Date: Apr-12-2000

Microsoft scanned this file for viruses. Microsoft used the most current
virus-detection software that was available on the date that the file was
posted. The file is stored on secure servers that prevent any unauthorized
changes to the file.

CAUTION: You must have multi-language support enabled to run this sample form
effectively. For more information on enabling multi-language support, please see
the "References" section.

After downloading and unzipping KybdStck.exe to a temporary directory, run the
form KybdStck. The list box is populated with any loaded Keyboard Layouts.
Clicking on a language sets the keyboard layout to that language. Clicking on
the button at the bottom of the form displays the currently selected layout.

This form demonstrates the following points:

- The Init event of the list box uses the GetKeyboardLayoutList function to get
  the number of Keyboard Layouts loaded. It also uses the GetKeyboardLayoutName
  and ActivateKeyboardLayout functions to generate a list of the loaded
  layouts.

- The click event of the command button uses the GetKeyboardLayoutName function
  to get the name of the currently loaded layout.

- The click event of the list box uses the ActivateKeyboardLayout function to
  set the layout to the selected language.

REFERENCES
==========

The table Langlist.dbf is used as a lookup for the keyboard layout descriptions.
This list was obtained from the July 99 edition of the MSDN Library and can be
found under the index listing of the LoadKeyboardLayout function and then
following the link for Language Identifiers.
