-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you enable an individual user to use the relay functionality, the relay
procedure fails, and the user receives the following error message:

  550 Relaying Is Prohibited

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur when you enter the subnet mask as (or if the mask is set
to) 255.0.0.0, 255.255.0.0, 255.255.255.0 or 255.255.255.255. If you click the
Routing Restrictions button in Exchange Server Service Pack 2 (SP2) or later,
you must enter a subnet mask.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this issue, use either of the following methods:

- Method One:

  1. Open the Internet Mail Service properties, click the Routing tab, and then
     click Routing Restrictions.

  2. Click to select the "Hosts and clients with these IP addresses" check box.

  3. Click Add, and then enter the user's IP address (for example,
     123.123.123.123) in the IP address box.

  4. In the Mask box, set the subnet mask to 255.255.255.&lt;x&gt;, where
     &lt;x&gt; is the last octet of the user's IP address (for example,
     255.255.255.123), and then click OK.

  5. Use the Services tool in Control Panel to stop and restart the Internet
     Mail Service.

- Method Two:

  1. Open the Internet Mail Service properties, click the Routing tab, and then
     click Routing Restrictions.

  2. Click to select the "Hosts and clients with these IP addresses" check box.

  3. Click Add, type the user's IP address in the IP Address box, type any
     subnet mask in the Mask box, and then click OK.

  4. Use the Services tool in Control Panel to stop and restart the Internet
     Mail Service.

  5. Start Registry Editor (Regedt.32.exe).

  6. Locate and click the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters

  7. Double-click the RelayAllowList value, delete the subnet mask and
     semicolon, (leaving only the user's IP address), and then click OK.

NOTE: After you finish this procedure, if you open the Internet Mail Service
properties, click the Routing tab, and then click Routing Restrictions, the Mask
box is blank. To apply these changes, use the Services tool in Control Panel to
stop and restart the Internet Mail Service.
