Product(s): Microsoft SNA Server
Version(s): WINDOWS:4.0,4.0 SP1,4.0 SP2,4.0 SP3
Operating System(s): 
Keyword(s): 
Last Modified: 08-MAY-2002

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start SNA Manager or the SNA Microsoft Management Console (MMC)
snap-in, an SNAOLE error message may appear that informs the SNA Administrator
that one or more link services are being deleted.

Note: Although these symptoms occur after installing an 802.2 DLC link service
with three active SDLC Link Services and Connections, other situations may also
produce these or other similar symptoms.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Apply it only to
computers that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive
additional testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0
service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The typical support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

+---------------------------------+
| File name    | Date     | Time  | 
+---------------------------------+
| Snaadmin.dll | 11/12/99 | 12:00 | 
+---------------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, stop the SNA Server Service before you install new
link services.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft SNA Server Version
4.0, Microsoft SNA Server Service Pack 1, Microsoft SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack
2, Microsoft SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 3.
