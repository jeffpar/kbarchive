-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A printer has a name longer than 64 characters. When you try to print to this
printer in Visual FoxPro using a command, such as LIST STRUCTURE TO PRINT, or a
report form, you receive the error:

  Fatal error: Exception: code:=C0000005

RESOLUTION
==========

Either upgrade to the latest service pack for Visual Studio 6.0 or change the
name of the printer so it is less than 64 characters in length.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a bug in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in the latest
service pack for Visual Studio 6.0.

For additional information about Visual Studio service packs, click the following
article numbers to view the articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q194022 INFO: Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs, What, Where, Why

  Q194295 HOWTO: Tell That a Visual Studio Service Pack Is Installed

To download the latest Visual Studio service pack, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/downloads/updates.asp

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the printer name is between 64 and 204 characters in length, the error may
not immediately occur and may appear intermittently in an application. If the
printer name is longer than 205 characters, the behavior normally occurs
immediately.

1. Run the following line of code in the Command window:

  _cliptext=REPLICATE("a",205)

2. From the Start menu, select Settings, open Control Panel, and then choose the
  Printers option. Highlight a local printer and press the F2 key. Paste the
  contents of Clipboard into the printer name using the CTRL+V key combination.
  Press ENTER to save the name.

3. Right-click the newly renamed printer and set it as the default.

4. Exit and restart Visual FoxPro.

5. Place the following code into a program and run it:

  SET SAFETY OFF
  CREATE TABLE testtab (f1 c(5))
  INSERT INTO testtab (f1) VALUE ("aaaa")
  LIST STRUCTURE TO PRINTER
  CREATE REPORT test FROM testtab
  REPORT FORM test TO PRINTER

The error mentioned in the "Symptoms" section appears and Visual FoxPro closes.
