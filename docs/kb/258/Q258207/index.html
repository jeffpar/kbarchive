-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A multiuse class in an ActiveX DLL implements a public non-creatable class that
has two properties. The class is instantiated in a Standard EXE, and values are
assigned to the properties of the object just created. When the value of the
form level object variable is examined in the locals window or a watch is set on
it, Visual Basic 6.0 displays the following error message:

  &lt;Object does not support this property or method&gt;

In Visual Basic 5.0, the values assigned to the properties are visible.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a bug in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Visual Basic Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. On the File menu, choose Add Project to add a new Visual Basic ActiveX DLL
  project, creating a Project Group. Class1 is created by default.

3. Set the Instancing property of Class1 to 2-PublicNotCreatable.

4. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Class1:

  Option Explicit

  Public Property Get X() As Long

  End Property

  Public Property Let X(ByVal X As Long)

  End Property

  Public Property Get Y() As Long

  End Property

  Public Property Let Y(ByVal Y As Long)

  End Property

5. On the Project menu, choose Add Class Module to add another class module to
  the project. Class2 is created by default. The Instancing property of Class2
  is set to the default: 5-MultiUse.

6. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Class2:

  Implements Class1
  Private m_X As Long
  Private m_Y As Long

  Private Property Get Class1_X() As Long
     Class1_X = m_X
  End Property

  Private Property Let Class1_X(ByVal X As Long)
     m_X = X
  End Property

  Private Property Get Class1_Y() As Long
    Class1_Y = m_Y
  End Property

  Private Property Let Class1_Y(ByVal Y As Long)
     m_Y = Y
  End Property

7. Return to Project1 and add a CommandButton control to Form1.

8. On the Project menu, choose References to open the References dialog box.
  Check the reference to Project2 and click OK.

9. Add the following code to the General Declarations section of Form1:

  Option Explicit

  Private Sub Command1_Click()
     Dim point As Class1
     
     Set point = New Class2
     
     point.X = 10
     point.y = 20
     Debug.Print point.X, point.y
  End Sub

10. Set a break point on the Debug.Print statement, run the project, and click
  Command1.

11. If the Locals window is not displayed, open the View menu and select the
  Locals window.

12. In the Locals window, click the plus sign (+) next to "point" to expand the
  tree view. Note that the following error message appears in the column where
  the values of x and y should be:

  &lt;Object does not support this property or method&gt;

  In Visual Basic 5.0, the values of x and y are set to 10 and 20,
  respectively.
