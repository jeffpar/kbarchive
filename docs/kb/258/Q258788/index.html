SYMPTOMS
========

If a password policy is being used in a Windows 2000 domain and some or all of
the users in the domain were migrated to Active Directory by using the Active
Directory Migration tool, users who attempt to change their password after
receiving the "Password Change Notification" message may receive the following
error message:

  You do not have permission to change your password.

If a user instead chooses not to change the password by clicking No, the user is
logged on with the old password, which the user can change any time thereafter.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs if the Everyone group has not been granted the Change
Password right on the user object. By default, the "Password Change
Notification" message appears 14 days before the "Maximum password age" policy
setting.

If the Everyone group does not have the Change Password right on the object,
passwords cannot be changed over the null session connection (anonymous logon
relies on the Everyone group to carry out this action) established between the
workstation and a domain controller. Instead, an authenticated session is
required to change a password (users must be logged on to change their
password).

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. Start the Active Directory Users and Computers snap-in.

2. Right-click your domain, and then click Advanced Features on the View menu to
  enable advanced features.

3. Right-click the container hosting the user object to which you want to grant
  the Change Password right (for example, Users), and then click Properties .

4. Click the Security tab. Make sure that the Everyone group is listed in the
  Name box. If it is not, click Advanced, and then add the Everyone group to
  the list from the Advanced Access Control Settings dialog box. If the
  Everyone group does exist, click Advanced and continue with the next step.

5. Click the Everyone group in the list, and then click View/Edit to edit the
  group's permissions. In the Apply Onto box, click User Objects. In the
  Permissions section, click to select the Change Password permission in the
  Allow box.


6. Click OK to accept the changes.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.
