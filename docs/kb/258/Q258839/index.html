The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Cmd.exe from other programs or batch files with another batch
file as a parameter, the script does not run but appears to be busy if the file
name is padded with space character.

When you check in Task Manager, you find a large number of instances of Cmd.exe.
Eventually, you receive error messages caused by insufficient memory, C run-time
error messages, or DLL initialization error messages.

A sample command line is:

  cmd /c "test.bat "

Note the extra space character before the second quotation mark. The contents of
Test.bat do not matter.

CAUSE
=====

Cmd.exe contains a parsing error that results in the behavior described in the
"Symptoms" section.
