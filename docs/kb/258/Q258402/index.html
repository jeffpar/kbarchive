-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Baseball 2001, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Microsoft Baseball 2001 version 1.0, quit the program, and then
try to start the program again, you may receive a black screen.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if any of the following conditions is true:

- Your primary video adapter has 2 megabytes (MB) or less of video memory
  installed.

- Your video driver is outdated.

- Your video adapter does not support Microsoft DirectDraw.

- The Hardware Acceleration setting on your computer is not set to Full.

- An incorrect or duplicate monitor is installed on your computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following methods in the order in which they are
presented.

Upgrade Your Video Adapter
--------------------------

To run Baseball 2001, your computer must have a video adapter with at least 2 MB
of video memory installed. If your video adapter does not have 2 MB of video
memory, install additional video memory, or upgrade to a video adapter that has
at least 2 MB of video memory.

To estimate the approximate amount of video memory that is installed on your
computer:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "dxdiag" (without the quotation marks).

3. Click OK.

4. Click the Display tab.

5. Under Device, verify the amount of memory that is listed next to "Approx.
  Total Memory".

  NOTE: If a video accelerator card is installed on your computer, a Display 1
  and a Display 2 tab are available. Click either tab to verify the approximate
  total memory.

6. Click Exit.

If the approximate total memory is more than 2 MB, and the behavior continues to
occur, contact the manufacturer of your video adapter to determine how to
resolve this issue.

Obtain and Install an Updated Video Driver
------------------------------------------

Contact your hardware manufacturer about how to obtain and install the latest
version of the video driver for your video adapter.

     device information and settings.

  c. Click OK.

6. Click OK, and then close Control Panel.

7. Restart Windows in Safe mode. To do this, use the appropriate method for your
  version of Microsoft Windows.

  5, click the new device, and then click Remove. Repeat this step for each
  device in the branch that is not in the list of devices that you noted in
  step 5.

  NOTE: If you see new copies of a device that is in the list of devices you
  noted in step 5, verify the properties of each copy of the device. If the
  properties for the device match the properties that you recorded, keep the
  device. If the properties for the device do not match the properties that
  you recorded, remove the device.

14. Click OK.

15. When you are prompted to restart the computer, do so.
