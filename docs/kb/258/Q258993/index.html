-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
- Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, versions 1.0, 1.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The COM Transaction Integrator (COMTI) object is not an available option in
Performance Monitor. When you open Performance Monitor, a Perflib event 1009 is
logged in the Application Event Log and states the following:

  The Open Procedure for service "COMTIPerf" in DLL "comtiperf.dll" generated
  an exception. Performance data for this service will not be available.
  Exception code returned is DWORD 0.

CAUSE
=====

The COM Transaction Integrator (COMTI) performance-measuring software is not
compatible with third-party performance measuring services, such as HP
MeasureWare or Performance SeNTry.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server 4.0. For
additional information, click the following article number to view the article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, stop the third-party services (such as HP
MeasureWare and Performance SeNTry) so that the COMTI object appears in
Performance Monitor. When Performance Monitor is open, start the other services.
The COMTI object will remain accessible in Performance Monitor.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version
4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS
and IMS, versions 1.0, 1.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3.

This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 4.
