-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 
- ActiveX Data Objects (ADO), versions 1.5, 2.0, 2.01, 2.1, 2.1 SP1, 2.1 SP2, 2.5 
- Microsoft Active Server Pages 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article is intended as a "best practices" guide for when you call database
components from Web applications in Internet Information Server/Services (IIS),
though most recommendations apply to any distributed application that accesses
database connections, either locally or remotely.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When Using ADO in ASP, Make Sure to...
--------------------------------------

- Always close recordsets and connections.

  rs.close
  set rs=nothing
  conn.close
  set conn=nothing

the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q176056 INFO: ADO/ASP Scalability FAQ

- Open late, close early: Open ADO objects just before they're needed and close
  them immediately after you're done. This frees resources while other logic is
  processing.

- Don't create ADO objects in session variables. This effectively bypasses MTX
  connection and thread pooling. If threads aren't pooled, each object created
  per user can tie up a thread. Also, if the object isn't specifically closed,
  a session object variable can live and tie up a thread for the life of a
  session (20 minutes after the last click).

- Do not pass parameters to the command object in the execute statement.

- If you are not marshalling data through a firewall, instantiate objects with
  Server.CreateObject. The Server part tells Microsoft Transaction Server to
  create the object in a Transaction Server package so that resources are
  pooled. (NOTE: this does not apply to IIS 5.0/COM+.)

- Do not reuse recordset or command variables. Create new ones.

the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q197449 PRB: Problems Reusing ADO Command Object on Multiple Recordsets

Additional Items to Consider:

- While configuring Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) settings for your data
  source, use system data source names (DSNs) as much as possible, rather than
  file DSNs. A system DSN is three times faster than a file DSN.

- Don't put ADO connections in session object. ODBC 3.x does connection pooling
  automatically for you.

- Use TCP/IP sockets to connect to Microsoft SQL Server if it is running on
  another computer. Use named pipes if SQL Server is running on the same
  computer as Active Server Pages (ASP).

- Ensure that a proxy account is used to connect to Oracle because Oracle
  assigns user context to each thread.

- Ensure that connection objects are created in each ASP page.

PerfMon Counters:

The ASP object provides excellent counters to do detailed monitoring of your ASP
application. The following points are particularly important:

- Errors-related counters (such as "Errors During Script Runtime") - these
  should be near zero in value. Any errors-related counters that are
  significantly larger than zero should be further investigated before
  proceeding with troubleshooting.

- Requests executing - This is very important because it tells you whether your
  application is forced to be single-threaded or not. The default worker
  threads for executing ASP requests in IIS 4.0 is 10 (ProcessorThreadMax in
  the registry). If the ASP Requests Executing counter returns a value of "1",
  then your requests are definitely being serialized for some reason. Make sure
  Web Application debugging is not on because this will serialize your
  requests.

the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q216580 PRB: Blocking/Serialization When Using InProc Component (DLL) from
  ASP

- Requests queued - If this number keeps increasing continuously, your ASP
  pages have blocked all threads for some reason and no threads are being
  released to service additional requests from the queue.

- Sessions total - This is the total number of sessions since the Web service
  was started. You may want to stop and restart the Web service before a test
  run to more accurately monitor the total sessions being created for a
  specific test script run. Make sure that while your script is running this
  number keeps gradually increasing until it reaches the desired total.
