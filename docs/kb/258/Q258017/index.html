SYMPTOMS
========

Using a UserControl control that contains another usercontrol and a TextBox
control, which is bound to a Field object of an ADO Recordset object, the
FieldChangeComplete event of the ADO RecordSet object is not fired after the
TextBox control has a change and loses its focus to the contained usercontrol by
mouse-clicking.

STATUS
======

listed at the beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in the latest

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new ActiveX control project. UserControl1 is added by default.

2. Change the name of UserControl1 to "MyControl" (without the quotation marks).

3. Place a Label on MyControl and change its caption to MyControl.

4. Size MyControl so that it is nearly the same as Label.

5. Close the MyControl window.

6. From the File menu, choose Add Project. Project2 is added with Form1 by
  default.

7. Right-click on Project2 and then click on Set as Start up.

8. From the Project menu, choose References, and then add references by checking
  the following items for Project2:

   - Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 2.1 Library

   - Microsoft Data Binding Collection

   - Microsoft Data Source Interfaces

9. From the Project menu, choose Add User Control. UserControl1 is added by
  default.

10. Place two TextBox controls, one MyControl and one Label on UserControl1.
  Make the TextBox controls relatively long.

11. Paste the following code into UserControl1's code window:

  Private colBndNwind As New BindingCollection
  Private WithEvents rs As ADODB.Recordset

  Public Sub Init()
  Set rs = New ADODB.Recordset
      With rs
          .Fields.Append "Text", adChar, 20
          .Open
          .AddNew
          .Fields.Item("Text") = "Text"
     End With
     
     ' Set the DataSource of the Bindings collection to the recordset.
     Set colBndNwind.DataSource = rs
     
     ' Add to the Bindings collection.
      With colBndNwind
          .Add Text1, "Text", "Text"
      End With
      Text2.ForeColor = 255
  End Sub

  ' Called after the value of Field objects has changed.
  Private Sub rs_FieldChangeComplete(ByVal cFields As Long, ByVal Fields As
  Variant, ByVal pError As ADODB.Error, adStatus As ADODB.EventStatusEnum,
  ByVal pRecordset As ADODB.Recordset)
    Text2.Text = "FieldChangeComplete: " &amp; Fields(0).Name &amp; " = " &amp; Fields(0).Value
  End Sub

12. Close the UserControl1 window.

13. Place one UserControl1 on Form1.

14. Paste the following code into Form1's code window:

  Option Explicit

  Private Sub Form_Load()
    UserControl11.Init
  End Sub

15. Press the F5 key to run the program.

16. Click on the TextBox that has Text, and type "Hello" (without the quotation
  marks). Click on MYCONTROL, and note that the FieldChangeComplete event is
  not fired because the other TextBox's text has no change.

17. Click on the TextBox again and type "Hey" (without the quotation marks).
  Click on Label1, and note that the FieldChangeComplete event is fired
  because the other TextBox is changed.

18. Click on the TextBox again and type "Hi" (without the quotation marks).
  Press the TAB key, and note that the FieldChangeComplete event is fired
  because the other TextBox is changed.
