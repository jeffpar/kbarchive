  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

The Internet Mail Service Extension, the Imsext.dll file, that is included in
the Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit adds the capability for inbound
journaling, outbound journaling, per-recipient Journaling, prepending text to
inbound e-mail, appending text to inbound e-mail, prepending text to outbound
e-mail, and appending text to outbound e-mail.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Installation and Configuration
------------------------------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To install and configure the Internet Mail Service Extension:

1. Copy the Internet Mail Service Extension, the Imsext.dll file, to the
  &lt;drive&gt;\Exchsrvr\Connect\Msexcimc\Bin folder.

2. At a command prompt in the Exchsrvr\Connect\Msexcimc\Bin folder, run
  "regsvr32 imsext.dll" (without the quotation marks).

3. To enable Internet Mail Service Extension in Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack
  1 (SP1) or later without losing routing table capability, you need to create
  a registry value:

NOTE: Microsoft recommends the following method to enable Internet Mail Service
Extension.

  a. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

  b. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\
  MSExchangeIMC\Parameters

     NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
     readability.

  c. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry
     value:

  Value Name: NonRoutingExtensionDll
  Data Type: REG_SZ
  String Value: The full path of the Internet Mail Service Extension utility DLL

     You can also enable Internet Mail Service Extension in the Exchange Server
     Administrator program by opening the Internet Mail Service properties,
     click the Routing tab, and then select "Internet Mail Service Extension"
     as the custom routing program.

     IMPORTANT: Microsoft does not recommend this method. You lose routing table
     capability.

4. Create a registry key to house the data that is passed to the Internet Mail
  Service Extension DLL:

  a. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

  b. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\
  MSExchangeIMC\Parameters

     NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for
     readability.

  c. On the Edit menu, click Add Key, and then type "Extension" (without the
     quotation marks).

  d. Quit Registry Editor.

5. Stop and restart the Internet Mail Service.

You can use the capabilities of the Internet Mail Service Extension together or
separately by adding the appropriate registry value or values. You can add or
delete all values in the Extension key that you added as part of the
installation and configuration. You must restart the Internet Mail Service any
time that you change one of the registry values, with the exception of the
per-recipient journaling recipient's journal property.

Inbound Journaling
------------------

To journal inbound Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) e-mail, create a registry
string value named InboundJournal in the Extension key. Set the InboundJournal
value to the e-mail address of the mailbox that will act as the journal mailbox.
If you use a distribution list (DL) as the journal mailbox, you can journal mail
to multiple mailboxes and it is very easy to change the journal mailbox.
Microsoft recommends that you also remove the SMTP address, so that the mailbox
cannot be attacked from the outside, and hide the mailbox from the address book,
so that the mailbox is difficult to attack from the inside. You can then set the
address to the X.500 address of the DL.

If you enable inbound journaling, you must also create a registry string value
named InboundJournalNDR in the Extension key. Set the InboundJournalNDR value to
the e-mail address to which you want non-delivery reports (NDRs) that are
generated by journaled inbound e-mail delivered. As with the InboundJournal
value, remove the InboundJournalNDR value's SMTP address and hide the mailbox
from the address book. Microsoft recommends that this recipient reside on the
same server as the Internet Mail Service Extension.

Example:

  InboundJournal=/O=ACME/OU=EASTCOAST/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=globalarchdl
  InboundJournalNDR=/O=ACME/OU=EASTCOAST/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=injournalndr

Outbound Journaling
-------------------

To journal outbound SMTP e-mail, create a registry string value named
OutboundJournal in the Extension key. Set the OutboundJournal value to the
e-mail address to which you want the journal e-mail delivered. If you use a DL
as the journal mailbox, you can journal mail to multiple mailboxes and it is
very easy to change the journal mailbox. Microsoft recommends that you also
remove the SMTP address, so that this mailbox cannot be attacked from the
outside, and hide the mailbox from the address book so that the mailbox is
difficult to attack from the inside. You can then set the address to the X.500
address of the DL. If you enable outbound journaling, you must also create a
registry string value named OutboundJournalNDR in the Extension key. Set the
OutboundJournalNDR value to the e-mail address to which you want NDRs that are
generated by journaled outbound mail delivered. As with the OutboundJournal
value, you should remove the OutboundJournalNDR value SMTP address and hide the
mailbox from the address book. Microsoft recommends that the recipient reside on
the same server as the Internet Mail Service Extension.

NOTE: If you use the same value for the InboundJournal and OutboundJournal
registry values, you can use one mailbox for all journaling.

Example:

  OutboundJournal=/O=ACME/OU=EASTCOAST/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=globalarchdl
  OutboundJournalNDR=/O=ACME/OU=EASTCOAST/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=outjournalndr

Per-Recipient Journaling
------------------------

The InboundJournal and OutboundJournal values journal all inbound and outbound
e-mail, respectively. If you want to journal based on recipient, you can enable
per-recipient journaling, which enables you to specify the journal address on a
for-each-recipient basis. This capability is useful if you want to send a copy
of a user's SMTP e-mail to that user's branch manager, for example. As with
inbound journaling and outbound journaling, you can set per-recipient journaling
for each direction: inbound and outbound.

To enable per-recipient journaling, you must specify a property on the recipient
that contains the journal address. You can use the Custom Attributes properties
of the recipient to do this. As with the InboundJournal and OutboundJournal
values, it is recommended that you set the recipient's custom attribute to a DL.
In addition, Microsoft recommends that you secure the mailboxes in that DL, as
well as the DL itself, by removing the SMTP address and hiding the objects from
the Address Book. After you decide what recipient property you want to use to
store the journal address, you must create a registry DWORD value named
InboundRecipJournalProp or OutboundRecipJournalProp, as appropriate, for inbound
or outbound journaling, and then set the InboundRecipJournalProp or
OutboundRecipJournalProp value to the property that you want.

Example:

  The Custom Attribute 10 is value 0x8036. This must be specified as the high
  word of the InboundRecipJournalProp value with a low word of 0. Therefore,
  the value of InboundRecipJournalProp in this example is 0x80360000.

The values of the Custom Attributes can be found in the Emsabtag.h file in the VC
include folder. If you enable per-recipient inbound journaling or per-recipient
outbound journaling, you must also create a registry string value named
InboundJournalNDR or OutboundJournalNDR, as applicable, for per-recipient
outbound journaling. Set the InboundJournalNDR or OutboundJournalNDR value to
the e-mail address to which you want NDRs that are generated by journaled
inbound or outbound mail for per-recipient journaling delivered. As with the
InboundRecipJournalProp value, Microsoft recommends that you remove the
InboundJournalNDR or OutboundJournalNDR SMTP address and hide the mailbox from
the Address Book. Microsoft recommends that the recipient reside on the same
server the Internet Mail Service Extension.

NOTE: You can use per-recipient journaling in conjunction with inbound journaling
and outbound journaling. You can also set the InboundRecipJournalProp and
OutboundRecipJournalProp values to the same value to journal both inbound and
outbound per-recipient mail to the same location.

Example:

  InboundRecipJournalProp=(DWORD) 0x80360000 (Custom Attribute 10)
  OutboundRecipJournalProp=(DWORD) 0x80360000 (Custom Attribute 10)
  Custom Attribute 10 (of some recipient)
  =/O=ACME/OU=EASTCOAST/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=branch1archdl
  InboundJournalNDR=/O=ACME/OU=EASTCOAST/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=injournalndr
  OutboundJournalNDR=/O=ACME/OU=EASTCOAST/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=outjournalndr

Prepending Text to Inbound E-Mail
---------------------------------

To add prepended text to the body of an inbound SMTP message, create a registry
string value named InboundPrepend. Set the InboundPrepend value to the text that
you want to prepend to the message. You must enter this text as Rich Text Format
(RTF).

+-----------------------------------------+
| Command | Result                        | 
+-----------------------------------------+
| \b      | Bold on                       | 
+-----------------------------------------+
| \b0     | Bold off                      | 
+-----------------------------------------+
| \i      | Italics on                    | 
+-----------------------------------------+
| \i0     | Italics off                   | 
+-----------------------------------------+
| \ul     | Underline on                  | 
+-----------------------------------------+
| \ulo    | Underline off                 | 
+-----------------------------------------+
| \plain  | Plaintext--All formatting off | 
+-----------------------------------------+
| \par    | New line or new paragraph     | 
+-----------------------------------------+
| \tab    | Tab in five spaces            | 
+-----------------------------------------+

NOTE: You can specify both InboundPrepend and InboundAppend values.

Example:

  InboundPrepend=This is the inbound prepended disclaimer.
  This is the second line.

Appending Text to Inbound E-Mail
--------------------------------

To add appended text to the body of an inbound SMTP message, create a registry
string value named InboundAppend in the Extension key. Set the InboundAppend
value to the text that you want to append to the message. You must enter this
text as RTF.

NOTE: You can specify both InboundPrepend and InboundAppend values.

Example:

  InboundAppend=This is the inbound appended disclaimer.\par
  This is the second line.

Prepending Text to Outbound E-Mail
----------------------------------

To add prepended text to the body of an outbound SMTP message, create a registry
string value named OutboundPrepend. Set the OutboundPrepend value to the text
that you want to prepend to the message. You must enter this text as RTF.

NOTE: You can specify both OutboundPrepend and OutboundAppend values.

Example:

  OutboundPrepend= This is the first line of the prepended disclaimer.
  This is the second line of the prepended disclaimer.

Appending Text to Outbound E-Mail
---------------------------------

To add appended text to the body of an outbound SMTP message, create a registry
string value named OutboundAppend. Set the OutboundAppend value to the text that
you want to append to the message. You must enter this text as RTF.

NOTE: You can specify both OutboundPrepend and OutboundAppend values.

Example:

  OutboundAppend=This is the first line of the outbound appended disclaimer.
  This is the second line of the outbound appended disclaimer.
