-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you enable "Heartbeat Discovery", performance degradation occurs when
multiple users restart or log on to the network.

CAUSE
=====

Each client generates a "discovery data record" (DDR) that contains information
about the resource, and the client returns this file through the Systems
Management Server hierarchy to the Systems Management Server site database.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, install Systems Management Server version 2.0 Service
Pack 1 (or later).

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0
Service Pack 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Prior to installation of Service Pack 1, if you enabled the default settings to
perform a heartbeat discovery, this generated what was known as a "Thursday
morning rush hour". As observed in a Ccim32.log file, the default heartbeat
period was set to start the discovery on January 1, 1998, which was a Thursday.
Seven-day cycles from that date always ended on a Thursday. Consequently, there
was a Thursday morning "rush" of heartbeat DDRs as users came in and turned on
their computers. This would go unnoticed within a small network, but in a large
organization, multiple DDRs working their way up the Systems Management Server
hierarchy within a few hours of each other would significantly degrade the
performance of the network.
