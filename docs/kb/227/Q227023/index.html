-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Double-byte character set (DBCS) server names are not supported in Microsoft
Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0.

CAUSE
=====

SMS is compatible with a wide range of operating systems and network
environments, and therefore needs to operate within a common set of acceptable
standards.

For example, a standard corporate computing environment usually includes
operating systems ranging from Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 3.11 to Windows
2000. However, Windows 98 and earlier operating systems are not able to support
Domain Name System (DNS) characters in server names.

NOTE: Standard DNS does not support names outside of the ASCII range. Most
corporations have their own heterogeneous corporate intranet connection to the
Internet, and therefore have the need for standard DNS.

WORKAROUND
==========

To name servers in a DBCS or international hierarchy, use ASCII characters.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this behavior to be by design of Systems Management
Server 2.0.
