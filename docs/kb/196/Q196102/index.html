-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, on platform(s):
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Changing the Width and Length values of the Custom page size using dialogs
within the Visual FoxPro Report Writer may cause the report to appear distorted
when the report is reopened. Additionally, the report loses the values typed in
the Width and Length fields.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, use the Windows Control Panel Printers icon and set
the Custom paper size as the default.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem does not occur when running on Windows NT since there is no such
dialog box. To setup a custom paper size, you must create a custom form in
Windows NT.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In Windows 95 or Windows 98, load a dot matrix printer driver, such as the
  Epson LX-800. Set the dot matrix driver as your default printer in Windows.

2. Use the Printers icon in Control Panel to make sure that the dot matrix
  printer has a paper size set to something other than Custom.

3. Create a report in Visual FoxPro 3.0, 5.0, or 6.0 and add a few fields. From
  the File menu, choose Page Setup. In the Page Setup dialog box, click the
  Print Setup button. In the Print Setup dialog box, click the Properties
  button and double click the Custom icon. In the User Defined Size dialog box,
  type in new values for the Width and Length. For example, in the User-Defined
  Size dialog box, set Unit to 0.01 inches, Width to 850 and Length to 1100 for
  an 8.5 inch x 11 inch page. Save the changes and close the various dialog
  boxes.

4. Preview the report. The report looks normal.

  NOTE: This step may produce the following error and you may not be able to
  preview the report:

  Page Header band is Too Large to fit on Page.

5. Save the report.

6. Reopen the report.

You expect that it should retain the values entered and not cause distortion in
the report.

However, the report loses the values you typed into the User-Defined Width and
Length fields. Furthermore, the report may shrink to a much smaller size or the
header, detail, or footer band may become distorted.
