SUMMARY
=======

Using the new System Preparation tool, Sysprep, it is now possible to use disk
image duplication software such as Symantec's Norton Ghost, Altiris's
RapiDeploy, and Micro House's ImageCast. The Sysprep tool changes the SID of the
cloned Windows NT Workstation so that it is unique. Questions have come up as to
whether computers that are to be cloned can be added to a Windows NT domain
before the Sysprep tool is run.

The focal point of this article is to discuss how SIDs are related to Sysprep and
what precautions to take when using the Sysprep tool (that is, assigning local
permissions, adding workstations to the domain, and so on).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Sysprep utility is used to change the SID of the cloned workstation so that
it is unique in the domain. Only local workstation SIDs are affected by this
tool. For this reason, it is important not to assign any local permissions on
the workstation before running Sysprep.

If local permissions are set prior to running Sysprep, they will not be valid
when the local SID is changed after Sysprep is run. This is only true for local
permissions. Domain permissions can be set for users prior to Sysprep running
because these SIDs are stored on the domain controllers and will not be affected
by the local SID that is being changed.

It is also recommended to clone workstations while they are members of a
workgroup rather than a domain. The reason for this has to do with machine
account names and not necessarily SIDs. If a Sysprep source computer is created
with a computer name, that same computer name will be duplicated when the
computer is cloned. Windows NT domains use the machine account name to establish
trust relationships between the domain controllers and the workstations. If
computers are added to the domain prior to being cloned, the computer name will
need to be changed after the clone procedure is complete for this workstation to
be able to participate in the domain. For this reason, it is best to prepare the
computer as a workgroup member and then perform the clone procedure. After the
installation is verified as successful and Sysprep has been run, the workstation
can be added to the domain with a unique machine account name.

Sysprep can be combined with Netdom.exe, a powerful command-line utility from the
Windows NT Server 4.0 Resource Kit, to script joining a domain, manage computer
accounts for members and BDCs, reset secure channels, establish trust
relationships, and manage resource domain computer accounts.
