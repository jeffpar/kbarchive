IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

When you use some applications in Windows Terminal Server, the mouse may jump or
not move in a controlled fashion. This behavior has been observed in
computer-aided design (CAD) programs, but may occur anywhere that precision
mouse control is necessary.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, the Terminal Server client sends mouse strokes to the Terminal
Server at an interval of 100 ms. The performance of the mouse can be improved by
lowering this setting through the registry. Please note that these are client
entries.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

1. On the Terminal Server client computer, open the registry and go to the
  following key:

     HKEY_CURENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server Client

2. Select Terminal Server Client.

3. Create a new DWORD value.

4. Name the new DWORD value: Min Send Interval

5. Set the value to: 10.

You may want to adjust the value as needed for your particular network, weighing
the additional network traffic against the enhanced mouse performance.
