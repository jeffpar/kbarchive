-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to open remote directory objects using the Exchange Server
Administrator program, the following pop-up error message is displayed

  Access Denied. The data to be configured could not be loaded.

The additional message syntax will vary according to the object that is being
opened.

This does not occur opening local directory objects.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Windows NT Service Pack 3 includes a new feature that can deny remote
anonymous access to the registry. If this has been enabled, opening any
directory object that attempts to access the remote registry will fail (for
example, Diagnostic Logging).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, remove this feature from the remote registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the RestrictAnonymous value under the following key in the registry:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA

3. Delete the following object:

     Value Name: RestrictAnonymous
     Data Type:  REG_DWORD
     Value:      1

4. Quit Registry Editor and restart the computer for the change to take effect.

================

Additional details on this feature can be found in Q143474.
