-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When starting SNA Server Manager, it may intermittently fail to find the
subdomain. This has been observed when Manager is run from an SNA Client
computer, which is located on the other side of a router from the sponsor
servers. The error message that is displayed is "&lt;subdomain&gt; NOT FOUND."
Traces indicate that when the problem occurs, Manager is attempting to locate
the servers using local broadcast, which fails because the servers are on the
other side of a router.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Manage Client (Mngcli.exe), which is started when Manager (Snaexp.exe)
starts, requires time to initialize. SNA Server Manager times out before the SNA
Manage Client can completely initialize, resulting in a local broadcast for any
SNA Server computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 3.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
3.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q184307 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 3.0 Service Pack



SNA Server 4.0
--------------

This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server version 4.0 U.S. Service
Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack, query on the following
word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):

  S E R V P A C K


WORKAROUND
==========

The problem is timing related. Deleting the SNA Server Manager settings file
(Snaexp.snav) seems to work around the problem, most likely because the timing
of the SNA Manage Client (Mngcli.exe) initialization process is altered.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0
Service Pack 1, 3.0 Service Pack 2, 3.0 Service Pack 3, 4.0, and 4.0 Service
Pack 1. This problem was first corrected in SNA Server 3.0 Service Pack 4.
