SUMMARY
=======

When you attempt to view a list of Global Address Book names from the drop down
box in the "Show Names From" section of the Address Book using either the
Exchange or Outlook clients, certain objects may not appear in the list.

This list of objects can include the following:

  Recipient Containers
  Site Objects
  Exchange Server Distribution Lists
  Exchange Server Mailboxes
  Public Folders

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior can occur if the Search permission has been set by the
administrator in the Exchange Server Administrator program. The search control
in Exchange Server 5.5 is used to limit directory access, and after being set by
an administrator, the recipients in the global address list may become
unavailable or do not have the same appearance as before. This can be confusing
to some end users.

If the Search permissions were set in error, then removing the Search permissions
in the Exchange Server Administrator program will correct the look of the global
address list.

For additional information on how to check search permissions, please see the
following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q182902 XADM: How To Setup Container Level Search Control

  Q173760 XADM: User's GAL Displayed Differently Based on Search Control

Typically, Search permissions are used if you have multiple companies or
departments in one Exchange Server organization, and you want to prevent these
companies or departments from viewing each other's mailboxes.
