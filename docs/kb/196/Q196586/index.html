SYMPTOMS
========

There are four known bugs with HttpSendRequest API:

1. When the lpOptional buffer (fourth parameter) is larger than 32 bytes and
  less than 150 bytes, HttpSendRequest fails with the error 12004 internal
  error.

2. When the lpOptional parameter is not NULL, the HttpSentRequest API does not
  separate the buffer from the headers with \r\n\r\n. It uses only a single
  pair: \r\n. This violates the HTTP specification (RFC 2068); therefore, HTTP
  servers treat the lpOptional buffer as part of the request headers, not as
  request content.

3. When lpszHeaders (second parameter) is not NULL, API corrupts the headers
  added to the request.

For example, if you call the API in the following way:

  HttpSendRequest (hReq, "Header: value", -1L, NULL, 0)

the following request is sent to the server:

  GET /myurl.htm HTTP/1.0\r\n
  Accept: */*\r\n
  Header: value\r\n
  : value\r\n
  User-Agent: My Test Agent\r\n

The correct request is:

  GET /myurl.htm HTTP/1.0\r\n
  Accept: */*\r\n
  Header: value\r\n
  User-Agent: My Test Agent\r\n

NOTE: In the above transcript, \r\n is a Carriage Return\Line Feed symbol.

4. When IP address is supplied to InternetConnect API, HttpSendRequest fails
  with error 12004 internal error.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can use one of the following workarounds:

Problem 1
---------

Make sure that the lpOptional buffer is either smaller then 32 bytes or larger
then 150 bytes. If you need to send a buffer smaller then 32 bytes, allocate a
buffer larger than 150 bytes and zero-pad it. Make sure that the server
component that reads the data, usually as part of the POST request, can
correctly handle zero padding.

Problem 2
---------

Start the lpOptional buffer with \r\n, as in the following sample:

  ...
  CHAR lpOptional[] = "\r\nBuffer Starts Here"
  HttpSendRequest (hReq, lpOptional, ....);
  ...

NOTE: When you do this, the Content-Length that is sent is now two bytes larger
than the content that you intended to send. Because HttpSendRequest always
appends an extra \r\n after the content, server applications see this additional
\r\n as part of the content. In the previous example, the Content-Length header
is 20 (the length of the string "\r\nBuffer Starts Here"), but the buffer read
by the server is the "Buffer Starts Here\r\n". Some server applications may not
work properly with the additional \r\n.

Problem 3
---------

Header corruption in HttpSendRequest is due to the problem in
HttpAddRequestHeaders(). Therefore calling HttpAddRequestHeaders() to add
headers does not work; corrupted headers will be added to the request. There is
no workaround for this issue. It is not possible to add a custom header to a
request that includes a body. Though the following may appear as a workaround,
it should still not be used. Due to problem 2, you can start at the beginning of
the data with headers, as in the following sample:

  ...
  CHAR lpOptional[]="Content-Type: text/html\r\n\r\nBuffer Start Here"
  DWORD dwSize = strlen (lpOptional);
  HttpSendRequest (hReq,..,lpOptional,dwSize)
  ...

Because the original request headers are separated by only a single \r\n pair,
the server still treats "Content-Type: text/html" as part of the HTTP request
headers. Please note that starting request body with header changes the
Content-Length header that is calculated by Windows CE. In this case
Content-Length will include the length of headers. A correctly written server
application handling POSTs (that is, CGIs) that read amount of data specified in
Content-Length will not work with such requests. The server application will
block because the body of the request is smaller than specified in the
Content-Length header.

NOTE: Due to the issue above, it is not possible to invoke an Active Server Pages
(ASP) script with the POST method. Simulating programmatic form submission
requires adding a custom header: Content-Type: application/x-www-
form-urlencoded, that is not possible.

Problem 4
---------

If it's necessary to use IP address in the application, use WinSock API
gethostbyaddr to convert it to host name. Use this host name in InternetConnect.
Code similar to this converts IP address in dotted decimal notation to the host
name:

     struct hostent *hostinfo;
      WSADATA      wsaData; 
      u_long res;
      
      if (WSAStartup(MAKEWORD (1,1),&amp;wsaData) != 0)
      {
           // Handle error here
      }
      
      if ((res = inet_addr ( "123.123.123.123" )) != INADDR_NONE )
      {
          if ((hostinfo = gethostbyaddr ((char*) &amp;res, sizeof(res),AF_INET))
               == NULL)
          {           
              // Handle error here
          }
      }
     else
         // Handle error here

   // At this point hostinfo-&gt;h_name contains host name in ASCII
  //  make sure to convert it to UNICODE before calling InternetConnect.
      
      WSACleanup();
  ?

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed these bugs in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. These problems have been corrected in Microsoft
Windows CE, versions 2.1 and 2.11.

NOTE: If you use workarounds 2 or 3 in your code, the HTTP request may not be
sent correctly on Windows CE 2.1 and 2.11, where these problems have been
corrected.
