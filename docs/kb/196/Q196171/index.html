  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

If a previous install of Exchange Server versions 4.0 or 5.0 had the Key
Management Server (KM Server) installed on it, and the Exchange Server
installation was then uninstalled using Setup, while the KM Server was
uninstalled by manually deleting the directory, a registry entry for the KM
Server is left behind.

If you were to now install Exchange Server version 5.5 without the KM Server, and
then try to run the Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 1 update, the upgrade will
incorrectly attempt to upgrade the KM Server.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, to delete the MSExchangeKMS service registry entry
using Regedt32. The steps are listed below.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the the following key in the registry:

     &lt;B&gt;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeKMS&lt;/B&gt;

3. Delete this key.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Setup component of Exchange
Server version 5.5 Service Pack 1.
