SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the Microsoft System Preparation tool, Sysprep, the duplicated
systems still have the Sysprep tools (Sysprep.exe and Setupcl.exe) on the local
drive. Documentation states that these files will be removed from the directory
in which Sysprep resides upon completion of the cloning process.

CAUSE
=====

This problem will happen when the folder in which the Sysprep files were located
was named something other than Sysprep or was not located on the same volume in
which the %WINDIR% resides (for example, Winnt, Winnt40, and so on).

RESOLUTION
==========

Move Sysprep and its associated files to the volume that contains the %WINDIR%
and ensure that the folder in which Sysprep resides is named Sysprep. However,
by design, the Setupcl.exe file is placed in the %SystemRoot%\System32 folder
and will remain after the cloning process has completed.

MORE INFORMATION
================
