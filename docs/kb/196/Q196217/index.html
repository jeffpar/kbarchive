SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server information store shuts itself down when the Jet
database engine (EDB) reports that the hard disk drive containing the
transaction logs is full. This problem may also occur when there is sufficient
disk space available but the transaction logs are contained within a Services
for Macintosh (SFM) volume.

The following sequence of events will appear in the Windows NT Application Event
logs prior to the information store shutting down:

  Event ID:    32
  Source:      EDB
  Type:        Error
  Category:    Logging/Recovery
  Description: MSExchangeIS ((273) ) Unable to create the log. The drive
               may be read-only or out of disk space. Error -1811.

  Event ID:    1111
  Source:      MSExchangeIS
  Type:        Error
  Category:    General

  Event ID:    1101
  Source:      MSExchangeIS Private
  Type:        Error
  Category:    Background Cleanup
  Description: Error -510 occurred during a background cleanup on message
               1-E85.

  Event ID:    1101

               EcDoDeliverMessage Error: -510

  Event ID:    1101
  Source:      MSExchangeIS Private
  Type:        Error
  Category:    Background Cleanup
  Description: Error -510 occurred during a background cleanup on message
               1-E93.

  Event ID:    5004
  Source:      MSExchangeSA
  Type:        Error
  Category:    General
  Description: Generation of the offline Address Book is complete. Result:
               The Microsoft Exchange Server computer is not available.
               Either there are network problems or the Microsoft Exchange
               Server computer is down for maintenance. Microsoft Exchange
               Server Information Store ID no: 8004011d-0525-00000000.

After the information store has shut itself down, the administrator can restart
the information store provided there is sufficient disk space available.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur when SFM has been installed on the Exchange Server
computer and the Jet transaction logs (DSADATA and MDBDATA) reside on a
Macintosh volume. After the information store has shut itself down after the
error has occurred, a zero byte Edbtmp.log or a zero byte Edb.log file will be
left in the MDBDATA directory. This error condition arises when the Edb.log file
is full and needs to be rolled over to the next generation log file number. A
zero byte Edbtmp.log file is created by Jet and is extended to a file size of 5
MB. Edb.log is then renamed to the next numbered log file (for example,
Edb000xx.log). Edbtmp.log is then renamed to Edb.log and then jet continues
processing new incoming messages.

The problem occurs in the transition of renaming these files when SFM is
involved. With SFM, there are essentially two file indexes that need to be kept:
NTFS and Apple Fileshare Protocol (AFP). A timing condition can arise where the
AFP update occurs after the file has already been renamed and thus no longer
exists under the old name in NTFS. If so, SFM will create a new zero byte file,
which causes an error condition that reports back to Jet that "The file already
exists." This error is eventually interpreted by Jet as being an out of disk
space condition and the information store then shuts itself down to maintain the
database integrity.

WORKAROUND
==========

This problem can be avoided by not having any Jet transaction logs located on a
SFM volume.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
the individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
pack, please go to:
