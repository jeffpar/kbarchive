SUMMARY
=======

You can configure Systems Management Server to provide individual user account
permissions for database access, and to limit Remote Control access to specific
users.

This article describes the steps necessary to configure SQL Server and Systems
Management Server to allow a Systems Management Server administrator to provide
user-level access permissions for a user group.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To grant permissions to domain user accounts, SQL Server must be made aware of
the domain user accounts. To do this, you must configure SQL Server to use Mixed
or Integrated security, using the following steps:

1. In Windows NT User Manager for Domains, create a group for the user accounts
  you want to be given access to Systems Management Server. For this example,
  the group will be called SMSUsers. After creating the group, add any user
  accounts to this group that you want to be able to access Systems Management
  Server clients.

2. From the SQL Server program group on the SQL Server, start SQL Setup. Click
  the Continue button until you are able to select Set Security Options. Make
  sure Set Security options is selected and then click Continue once more. In
  the Login Security Mode section of the Set Security Options dialog box,
  select either Mixed or Integrated security and then click OK.

3. Stop and restart the MSSQLServer service.

4. From the SQL Server program group, start SQL Security Manager. On the View
  menu, click User Privilege.

5. On the Security menu, click Grant New. The Grant User Privilege dialog box
  appears. Click to select SMSUsers from the list of groups. At the bottom of
  the dialog box, ensure that the Add Login IDs For Group Members and Add Users
  To Database options are checked. Ensure that the SMS database is selected in
  the drop-down list, and then click Grant. After it is finished, click Done.
  If errors are reported, click Error Detail to view the reasons for the
  errors.

6. From the Systems Management Server program group, start SMS Security Manager.
  The user accounts should now be available in the drop down list.

  NOTE: There may be a several minute delay before the new user accounts are
  visible in the drop down list. Also, any new domain user accounts created
  after this procedure will need to be added to SQL Security Manager; they are
  not added automatically. To do this, you can do either of the following:

   - Add the new account(s) to SQL Security Manager individually.

  -or-

   - In SQL Security Manager, remove and re-add the group you created in Step 1
     of this procedure (in this example, the SMSUsers group). Doing this
     re-enumerates the group membership list in SQL Security Manager. Note that
     you should make sure the new accounts have been added to the SMSUsers
     group before performing this step.
