-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may be unable to log on to both a Windows NT and Novell NetWare server
simultaneously from a computer that has the Novell Intranetware Client 4.11a
installed. Even though you may be able to log on to a Windows NT server,
attempting to log on to both a Novell NetWare server and a Windows NT server at
the same time may only be successful for the NetWare account. A local account is
then created on the Windows NT client, and the Windows NT domain login script
does not run.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. In the Novell Intranetware Client Services dialog box, click to select the
  Windows NT Login Only on the Windows NT tab, and then log on to the Windows
  NT domain.

2. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double- click
  the Network icon. Click the Services tab, click "Novell Intranetware Client
  for Windows NT," click Properties, click the Novell Workstation Manager tab,
  click to clear the "Enable workstation manager on these trusted trees" check
  box, and then click OK.

3. Click OK to return to Control Panel, and then restart the computer to
  successfully process dual logon requests.

NOTE: On a computer configured to use a Windows NT local account, this resolution
will disable the Novell Automatic Client Update feature of the Intranetware
client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the products listed above.
