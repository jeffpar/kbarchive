SUMMARY
=======

It is possible to run an application on the client computer that monitors a
modem on SBS for incoming calls, such that, when a call comes in, the SBS server
does not answer it but instead the software on the Modem Sharing client senses
it as a call to a directly connected modem and answers it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Essentially, with the Modem Sharing service, the COM port on the server is being
shared. The client piece simulates an extra communications port on the above
specified clients. Any calls to that simulated local port on the client are
redirected to the Modem Sharing service on the server and subsequently sent to
the shared COM port on the server.

Any application trying to directly access such a port on the client using
hardware calls will fail as this is a simulated COM port available through the
windows environment only. So, only applications that access the port using
windows API calls will work.

Please keep the following in mind:

- Only one client can monitor the modem as it is locked for exclusive use as
  long as the client application is waiting to receive calls. All other
  applications will report this modem as "busy" or "in use" until the client
  application releases it.

- For this reason, the shared modem on the server should not be used for any
  other service except the Modem Sharing service.

To test for proper functioning:

NOTE: The following steps require the Dial-Up Server component of Windows 9x be
installed. This requires Windows 95 Plus! for Windows 95 clients.

1. Set up a modem sharing client on a Windows 9x computer and a shared modem on
  the server.

2. Make sure that the modem is not configured for RAS or fax service on the
  server.

3. Enabled Windows 9x's DialUp Server piece as follows:

  a. Open My Computer.

  b. Open Dial Up Networking.

  c. From the Connections drop down menu, select Dial-Up Server. The shared
     modem should show up as a tab in the Dial-Up Server dialog box.

  d. Select the shared modem.

  e. Configure the modem to receive calls by selecting the Allow Caller Access
     option.

4. Call in to the shared modem's phone line. You should hear modem tones trying
  to negotiate the connection.

5. Set the dial-up server back by clicking to clear the Allow Caller Access
  check box so that it does not answer any calls on the client.

If your application still does not find the COM port, contact the manufacturer to
find out if there is a Windows compliant version of the application.
