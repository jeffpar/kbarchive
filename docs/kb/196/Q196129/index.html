IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

During the initial installation of the Microsoft Exchange Key Management Server
(KMS) service, you are given a choice of whether you want to store the KMS
service password on a disk or to write the password on a secured piece of
paper.

If you choose to store the password on a secure disk, every time the KMS service
starts you are prompted to supply the disk that contains the KMS service
password.

If you choose to save the KMS service password on a secured piece of paper,
before you start the KMS service you need to manually type the KMS password in
the startup parameters box located at the bottom of the services window.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The choice that you make during the initial setup of the Microsoft Exchange Key
Management Server is stored in the Windows NT registry and can be altered.
Perform the following steps to make the KMS service point to a diskette instead
of the startup parameters box:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), and go to the following subkey:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Exchange\KMServer

2. In the right pane, double-click MasterPasswordPath.

3. In the String box, type the following:

  "A:\" (without the quotation marks)

4. Click OK.

5. In the right pane, double-click BackupPasswordPath.

6. In the String box, type the following:

  "A:\" (without the quotation marks)

7. Click OK.

8. Quit Registry Editor.

After you perform these steps the KMS service looks to drive A for the KMS
password.

Additionally, you need to create a disk that contains the KMS service password
inside a text file named Kmserver.pwd.

The Kmserver.pwd file must only contain the KMS service password that is given to
the Exchange Server administrator during the initial setup of Microsoft Exchange
Key Management Server.

If you remove the drive letter from the MasterPasswordPath value, you must
manually type the KMS service password in the startup parameter box every time
that the KMS service is started.
