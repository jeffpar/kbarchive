-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------



SYMPTOMS
========

In a Word for Windows mail merge operation, the Merge To Electronic Fax option
is unavailable when you are using WinFax Pro. (To locate the Merge To:
Electronic Fax option, open a mail merge main document, click Mail Merge on the
Tools menu, and then click the Merge button.)

CAUSE
=====

WinFax Pro versions 3.0 and 4.0 are not compatible with the Messaging
Application Programming Interface (MAPI) or Vendor-Independent Messaging (VIM)
standards. Word requires MAPI or VIM compliance to perform a mail merge
operation to an electronic fax. As a result, if your electronic fax software is
not MAPI or VIM compliant, Word removes the Electronic Fax list item from the
Merge To list.

With WinFax Pro, you can fax to only one phone number at a time. To perform a
mail merge to an electronic fax machine from Word, your fax software must be
able to fax to multiple phone numbers in the same operation.


WORKAROUND
==========

Method 1: Use a macro to fax
----------------------------

Create a macro that merges and faxes one record at a time.

NOTE: You cannot work around this problem by merging your document to the
printer, because Word sends all the merged documents to a single fax number.

Method 2: Use Microsoft Fax
---------------------------

Microsoft Windows 95:

  Install Microsoft Fax.

Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 3.11:

  Use Microsoft At Work PC Fax instead to merge your Word document to
  electronic fax.

  NOTE: If you have installed WinFax Pro 4.0 on Windows for Workgroups 3.11,
  WinFax Setup will disable Microsoft At Work PC Fax. For more information on
  what WinFax Setup does, see the additional notes in the WinFax Readme.doc.

Method 3: Use the WinFax Pro macro to merge to fax
--------------------------------------------------

WinFax Pro 3.0 contains a Word for Windows macro that allows you to merge to the
fax driver. The macro is described in the Ddemerg.doc file. The macro can be
found in Winfax.dot. This macro may be incompatible with Microsoft Word 97.
Contact Delrina for information about an updated macro.
