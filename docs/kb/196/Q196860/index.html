SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to rename or delete a file in the Open dialog box (on the File
menu, click Open) and you are viewing files in preview mode, you may receive the
following error message:

  Cannot rename [or delete] '&lt;file name&gt;': Access is denied.

  Make sure the disk is not full or write-protected and that the file is not
  currently in use.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when the file you are trying to rename or delete does not
contain a preview picture. Because this picture is absent, Word must open the
file so that you can scroll through it in the Open dialog box. When the file is
open, Word cannot display the properties.

WORKAROUND
==========

Before you attempt to rename or delete a file, change the view from Preview to
any other view (such as List, Details, or Properties) by clicking the
appropriate button in the Open dialog box.

NOTE: You may have to close and then reopen the Open dialog box before you can
rename or delete a file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Preview picture allows a snapshot of the first page of the document to appear in
the Open dialog box. You can save a preview picture of the document by clicking
Properties on the File menu and clicking the Save Preview Picture check box to
select it (the check box is in the lower-right corner of the Summary tab).
