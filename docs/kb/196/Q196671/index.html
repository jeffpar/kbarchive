SUMMARY
=======

When your data document contains a mixture of five-digit and nine-digit ZIP
Codes, you can use a field in Word to format ZIP Codes if they do not contain
hyphens. This field is useful when your data comes from another data source and
doesn't contain hyphens in the nine-digit ZIP Codes. This field operates whether
the data document does or does not contain hyphens.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Use the following field:

  {IF {=ABS({MERGEFIELD zip \# "####'-'#####"}) }&lt;&gt; {MERGEFIELD zip}
  {MERGEFIELD zip \# "#####'-'####"} {MERGEFIELD zip}}

NOTES:

To create the special field code braces, use the key combination CTRL+F9. Using
the "{" and "}" keys on the keyboard does not work.

Be sure that each record contains a ZIP Code; otherwise, an error message will
appear for that record.

You can change the merge field name from "ZIP" to something else, but nothing
else in the formula can be changed.

The formatting of the first merge field has four number signs followed by five
number signs. This appears incorrect but is necessary for the calculation that
takes place.


Note that single quotation marks surround the hyphens.

If you have created your data document using the Mail Merge Helper in Word, the
default field name for the ZIP Code is "Postal_Code." Substitute "Postal_Code"
for "zip" when creating the merge field.

NOTE: This code may not work if the ZIP Code field is from a Microsoft Access
data source and if that field is formatted as a number. If the ZIP Code starts
with a 0, for example "01234," Word interprets it as "1234." To work around this
behavior, format the ZIP Code fields as text (rather than as numbers) in
Microsoft Access. Then ZIP Codes beginning with zero will be available in Word.

How the Field Works
-------------------

Word does not include fields that count the number of characters in another
field. So, to determine the number of digits in the ZIP field, the field
construction above takes advantage of two facts: (1) when you format a numeric
field to include a hyphen, the hyphen is treated by other fields as a
subtraction sign; (2) numbers that begin with a zero are evaluated the same as
numbers that don't begin with a zero. For example, "01234" is evaluated by Word
as equal to "1234".

The ZIP field is placed in the main document with a hyphen so that the formula
can operate on it. Its absolute value is taken, which converts the number to a
positive value. This new number is compared to the literal ZIP Code. If the
numbers differ, it's a nine-digit code and this is printed, with formatting to
keep any leading zeros. If the calculated number is different from the literal
ZIP Code, the ZIP Code is printed as is.
