SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to open a Web in FrontPage Explorer, you are prompted for a name
and password. After entering the correct name and password, you are repeatedly
prompted to re-enter your name and password.

A Windows NT Administrator can open the Web in FrontPage Explorer and verify that
the user name is listed and allowed to access this Web, yet you are unable to
open it.

CAUSE
=====

This only occurs when the security is edited with the Fpsrvadm.exe or
Fpremadm.exe command-line utilities. User tokens are not refreshed until the
server is restarted.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are three methods to work around this problem.

Method 1 (Applies to IIS 4.0):

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and choose Control Panel.

2. Double-click the Services icon.

3. Stop and restart the IIS Admin Service. This will prompt you to stop W3svc
  (World Wide Web Publishing service), Msftpsvc (FTP Publishing service), and
  Smtpsvc (Microsoft SMTP service), if they are running.

4. Restart W3svc, Msftpsvc, and Smtpsvc individually. This can also be
  accomplished from the command line (as a part of a batch file) by issuing
  syntax at the following:

  net stop iisadmin /y
  net start w3svc
  net start msftpsvc
  net start smtpsvc

  NOTE: Not everyone uses the Msftpsvc or Smtpsvc services, therefore they may
  not need to be restarted.


Method 2:

Edit the security in FrontPage Explorer. This forces a refresh of the IIS
security cache without stopping and restarting the Web server.

1. Open the Web in FrontPage Explorer.

2. On the Tools menu, click Permissions. If this is a subweb, then on the
  Settings tab in the Permissions dialog box, click the "Use Unique Permissions
  for this Web radio button and click Apply.

3. In the Permissions dialog box, click the Users tab, and then click Add

4. In the Add Users dialog box, click the domain name or the computer name from
  the "Obtain list from:" drop-down.

5. In the "Users Can" section, click the appropriate radio button for the level
  of access you want to grant users.

6. Highlight the user name in the "Names" list box, and click Add.

7. Click OK to close the Add Users dialog box.

8. Click Apply, and then click OK to close the Permissions Dialog box.

Method 3 (Applies to IIS 3.0):

Stop and Start World Wide Web Publishing Service (W3SVC) from the Services applet
in Control Panel. This can also be accomplished from the command line (as a part
of a batch file) by issuing the following commands at a command prompt:

  net stop w3svc
  net start w3svc
