SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Microsoft NFL Fever 2000, the video frame rate may be slow during
the initial plays of the game, as in the following examples:

- Before and during the first kickoff in the game

- During the first play from scrimmage in the game

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if an STB Velocity 128 video adapter is installed in
your computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, continue to play the game. After you complete the
initial plays of the game, the video frame rate should increase until movements
in the game appear smooth.
