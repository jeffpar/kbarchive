IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry.

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade to Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 (SP4), you may experience a
problem printing to Hewlett-Packard (HP) 3Si, 4, 4Si, and 5Si printers. The
output may appear to take more room or pages.

CAUSE
=====

For SP4, changes were made in the way Windows NT selects which printer font to
use when a screen font is selected for printing. This may change the print
output if a larger font is used.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the printer supports PostScript, use a PostScript driver for the printer.
When you use the PostScript driver, the problem does not occur.

Windows NT Server or Workstation 4.0
------------------------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or the
individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service

Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition

4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition.

This problem was first corrected in Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6 and
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

The fix for this problem resolves some of the problems encountered, but there
still may be a situation in which the font that is selected is not the one that
was selected previously. You can make the following changes in the registry to
force the printer font to use. It may take a number of attempts to find the
previously used font.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\FontSubstitutes

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the name of the font you are
  using with a data type of REG_SZ.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

You must reboot the computer for these changes to take affect.
