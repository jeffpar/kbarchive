SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to recover Organizational Forms. If a backup of a
public information store database that contains a replica of the Organizational
Forms Library exists, you can recover forms from this library without restoring
the database into the production Exchange Server site. It may be useful to do
this procedure in scenarios where a different forms library has been configured
after the backup was performed and where restoring the old library may lead to a
risk of destroying existing forms.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To recover forms from a public database:

1. Restore the public database to a stand-alone Exchange Server recovery server.

For additional information about how to restore Exchange Server databases to a
different server, click the article number below to view the article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q163713 XADM: Recovering a Single Mailbox from the Online Backup

NOTE: Because you are only interested in the public database for this particular
recovery, you do not have to restore the private mailbox database.

2. After you start the information store, start the Exchange Administrator
  program, and then locate the Public Information Store object for the recovery
  server.

3. Open the properties of the Public Information Store object in the "Public
  Information Store Properties" dialog box, and then click the Instances tab.

4. Locate the Organizational Forms folder in the Public folders pane, click Add,
  and then click OK.

5. Click the Public Folder Resources object that is located under the Public
  Information Store object. In the right pane, verify that the Organizational
  Forms folder is listed. If the Total K value for the folder is zero (0), a
  replica of the library is not in this database. You must locate and restore a
  public database from a server that does have a replica of the library.

6. Open the properties of the &lt;Server Name&gt; object. In the Properties
  dialog box, click Advanced, and then click Consistency Adjuster.

7. Click to select the "Synchronize with the directory, and reset the home
  server value for public folders homed in unknown sites" checkbox.

8. To run the Consistency Adjuster, click "All Inconsistencies", and then click
  OK.

  NOTE: You must run the Consistency Adjuster to generate a directory object
  that corresponds to the forms library. Without this directory object, you
  cannot access the properties and permissions for the folder from Exchange
  Administrator program.

9. Expand the Folders tree, expand System Folders, and then expand EFORMS
  REGISTRY to display the Forms Library object.

10. Create a mailbox on the server, and then configure a Microsoft Outlook
  profile for the mailbox.

11. Open the properties of the forms library, and then click Client Permissions.
  Add the previously created mailbox as an owner of the forms library folder.

  NOTE: If the properties of the forms library are inaccessible because of a
  "Directory object not found" error, examine the Application event log to see
  why the Consistency Adjuster did not respond. The most common reason that
  the Consistency Adjuster does not respond is that the forms library was
  previously stored in a Recipients container that no longer exists. Create
  the container and run the Consistency Adjuster again to correct this issue.

12. Start Microsoft Outlook, and then use the profile that you created in step
  10.

  NOTE: If the forms library is not set for the default language, you may have
  to install a copy of Outlook to set the appropriate language.

13. Add a Personal Folders (.pst) file to the Outlook profile. Create a folder
  in the Personal Folders tree and name it "Save Forms".

14. Right-click the Save Forms folder, and then open the folder's properties.

15. On the Forms page, click Manage.

16. If the Organizational Forms Library is not selected for the left pane of the
  Forms Manager dialog box, click Set. In the Set Library To dialog box,
  select Organization Forms in the drop-down list, and then click OK.

17. In the Forms Manager dialog box, click Copy to copy each form to the Save
  Forms folder, click Close, and then click OK.

After you copy the forms to the .pst file, you may open the .pst file in a
profile that is configured for a forms library owner in the production system.
You can then use the Manage forms interface on the folder properties to copy the
forms to the permanent Organizational Forms Library.

You may also want to use Outlook to periodically create a backup to a .pst file
of all your Organizational Forms.
