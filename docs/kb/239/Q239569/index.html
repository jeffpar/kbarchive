Server Requirements
-------------------

To install the OWA components on a server, the following hardware and software is
required:

- Single or dual 60-megahertz (MHz) Pentium microprocessor (Pentium 133
  recommended)
- 64 megabytes (MB) of RAM
- High-speed network connection to Microsoft Exchange Server
- Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0 with Service Pack 3 or later (the latest
  service pack for Windows NT Server 4.0 is recommended)
- Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) 3.0 or later
- Active Server Pages (ASP)
  You can install the ASP components from the latest Windows NT Server 4.0
  service pack CD-ROM or download the latest Windows NT 4.0 service pack and
  the ASP components from http://www.microsoft.com/windows/servicepacks/. The
  ASP components are also included with IIS 4.0.

NOTE: Outlook Web Access is included with Exchange Server 5.5. Microsoft
recommends that you apply the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5,
because it includes enhanced Outlook Web Access components. For additional
