SYMPTOMS
========

While attempting to install a Visual Basic application, one of the following
errors occurs:

  (VB4) Could not open the file named: &lt;DRIVE LETTER&gt;:\&lt;FILENAME&gt;

  (VB5) Cannot find the source file '&lt;DRIVE LETTER&gt;:\\&lt;FILENAME&gt;'
  to install.

  (VB6) Cannot find file '&lt;DRIVE LETTER&gt;:\&lt;FILENAME&gt;. Please insert
  disk'.

Once one of these errors occurs, the installation does not complete successfully.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because the drive from which installation is running does not
support long filenames and the specific file referenced in the error message
contains a long filename. This problem is most common with CD-ROM drives whose
driver is out of date and does not offer support for long filenames. However,
this problem can also occur on any other drives (network, floppies, and so
forth) that also lack support for this feature.

RESOLUTION
==========

Several solutions exist for this problem:

1. Obtain and install an updated driver that adds support for long filenames on
  the device in question.

2. Modify the project such that no long filenames are used by any of the
  project's files, and then re-deploy.

3. Copy the entire contents of the setup from the CD (or network drive) to a
  folder on the local hard drive. Rename all files in this directory that
  currently have short filenames but originally contained long filenames. The
  correct long filenames can be determined by viewing the [FILES] and/or
  [BOOTSTRAP] sections of the SETUP.LST file. Finally, run SETUP.EXE from this
  local folder.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
