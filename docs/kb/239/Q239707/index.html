-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When TN3270 emulators are connecting through the TN3270 server (included with
SNA Server 4.0 Service Pack 2) to a host session, the TN3270 emulators may fail
to automatically reconnect if the session is terminated unexpectedly. The TN3270
emulator will reconnect to a host session if the user presses the Enter key.

The following message may be displayed in the TN3270 emulator window when the
host session is terminated unexpectedly:

  TN3270E Service Error 505

  SNA API verb &lt;verb&gt; failed.

NOTE: This message may not be displayed in the same manner for all TN3270
emulators.

When TN3270 emulators are configured to automatically connect, they successfully
reconnect to a host session after receiving the previous error message. This
occurs without any user intervention when they are connecting to a host session
through a TN3270 server, included with SNA Server versions prior to 4.0 Service
Pack 2 (SP2).

CAUSE
=====

The TN3270 server in SNA Server 4.0 SP2 was updated to use Windows NT I/O
Completion Ports to provide performance improvements. It is the use of I/O
Completion Ports that causes this particular problem to occur. Therefore, the
TN3270 server included with earlier versions of SNA Server does not exhibit this
behavior.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for SNA Server version
4.0. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q215838 How to Obtain the Latest SNA Server Version 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version 4.0
SP2. This problem was first corrected in SNA Server version 4.0 Service Pack 3.
