  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

In Windows NT you can install printer drivers from a trusted share, rather than
from the remote print server to which your print service is connected.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To install printer drivers from a trusted source:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Providers\LanMan
  Print Services\Servers

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following value:

  Value Name: LoadTrustedDrivers
  Data Type: REG_DWORD
  Value: 1

  A value of 1 indicates that drivers can be installed only from the trusted
  print server shares specified by the TrustedDriverPath value.

4. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following value:

  Value Name: TrustedDriverPath
  Data Type: REG_SZ = \\&lt;servername&gt;\&lt;sharename&gt;

  where &lt;servername&gt; is the name of the appropriate server and
  &lt;sharename&gt; is the name of the appropriate share.

  This value specifies the path to trusted print server shares from which you
  can install printer drivers. If the LoadTrustedDrivers value is 1, you can
  only install drivers from the server shares located in the path specified in
  the value of this entry.

5. Quit Registry Editor, and then restart your computer.

To obtain a set of trusted files, you must install a driver on a computer one
time. If you install printer drivers for a Windows NT 4.0 Intel system, the
following structure exists:

  %SystemRoot%\System32\Spool\Drivers\W32x86\2

You must copy the files from this folder into the \2 subfolder of the trusted
driver share. For example, if the share is located in the C:\Tmp folder and the
share name is "ins," the structure is C:\Tmp\2 and you must type the following
path into the registry:

  \\&lt;computername&gt;\ins
