SYMPTOMS
========

Adding the Notes Folder to the System Path
------------------------------------------

To Add the Notes Folder to the System Path on a Windows NT Server 4.0:

1. Open the System Control Panel, and then click the Environment tab.

2. Select the Path variable in the System Variables window.

3. Add the path to the Notes folder in the Value field. For example, if the path
  to the Notes folder is "C:\Notes" (without the quotation marks), add the
  following to the end of the path in the Value field:

  ;C:\Notes

4. After you enter the information, you need to restart the system.

To Add the Notes Folder to the System Path on a Windows 2000 Server:

1. Open the System Control Panel, click the Advanced tab, and then click
  Environment Variables.

2. Select the Path entry in the System Variables window, and then click Edit.

3. Add the path to the Notes folder in the Value field. For example, if the path
  to the Notes folder is "C:\Notes" (without the quotation marks), then add the
  following to the end of the path in the Value field:

  ;C:\Notes

4. After you enter the information, you need to restart the system.

Removing Redundant Copies of the Nnotes.dll File
------------------------------------------------

If you find more than one copy of the Nnotes.dll file, keep only the one located
in the Notes folder and delete all the other copies.
