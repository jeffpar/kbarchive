IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you reboot your computer, you may receive the following error message:

  Windows NT could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt:

  \%SystemRoot%\System32\Config\System\Hardware Profile/Last Known Good menu

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if there are too many printers installed. Based on the
number and types of drivers involved, the problem may start at around 900
printers. This issue can occur for local printers as well as for network
printers, or for a combination of both that exceeds around 900 printers.

Before you install the fix mentioned in the "Resolution" section, the information
for local printers is saved to the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Printers

The information for network printers is saved to the following key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Providers\LanManPrintServices

Because of this, the System subkey of the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive in the registry
may become too large to fit into the allocated memory space and may prevent the
system from booting.
For a detailed description of the underlying problem, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q102721 Err Msg: Windows NT Could Not Start Because the Following...

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

NOTE: This hotfix requires you to be running Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 5 to be
installed.

The English-language version of this fix comes in two parts.

The fix for the local printers issue is included in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6
and should have the following file attributes or later:

  Date      Time     File Name       Platform
  -------------------------------------------
  03/31/99  08:11p   Localspl.dll    Intel
  03/31/99  08:09p   Localspl.dll    Alpha

The fix for the network printers issue should have the following file attributes
or later:

  Date      Time     Size    File name     Platform
  -------------------------------------------------
  10/27/99  07:38p   80,144  Win32spl.dll  Intel
  10/27/99  07:37p  135,952  Win32spl.dll  Alpha


NOTE: To activate this fix, you must add the following registry value:

  Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print

  Value Name: UseSoftwareKey
  Type: DWORD

If you use this fix, you need to make this setting before you upgrade to Service
Pack 6. If you uninstall Service Pack 6, make sure that you are still running
the fix listed above.
