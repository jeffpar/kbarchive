-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- The Microsoft Active Template Library (ATL), versions 2.0, 2.1, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you register an ATL object on a system that uses a double-byte character
set (DBCS), ATL might put garbage characters in the registry entry for the
object.

CAUSE
=====

In the AddString function in ATL 3.0 in file StatReg.h, lpszT++ is used to walk
a character buffer, and then characters are added at that position. If the
buffer contains DBCS characters, this will cause corruption in the string
because ATL fails to take into account the 2-byte characters.

The function CParseBuffer::AddString in ATL 2.0 and 2.1 in file StatReg.cpp has
the same problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

Steps to Fix the Problem for ATL 2.0 and 2.1
--------------------------------------------

1. In StatReg.cpp, find the CParseBuffer::AddString function.

2. On line 8 of the AddString function, change

  lpszT++

  to:

  CharNext(lpszT)

3. Save StatReg.cpp so the changes will be retained.

4. Rebuild the project with a Release MinDependency build configuration. (If you
  do not build with this option, you would have to add _ATL_STATIC_REGISTRY to
  the preprocessor definitions of the project so ATL would add the registration
  code to your project. You would also have to remove the _ATL_DLL preprocessor
  option. You do not have to add _ATL_STATIC_REGISTRY if you are building with
  a Release MinDependency build configuration because it is already defined.)

5. Rebuild the project.

By using this procedure, the registration code for any COM objects in the project
will be statically linked and will not use the incorrect code in Atl.dll. This
will also add about 5 KB to the size of the executable or DLL.

Steps to Fix the Problem for ATL 3.0
------------------------------------

1. In StatReg.h, find the AddString function.

2. On line 8 of the AddString function, change

  lpszT++

  to:

  CharNext(lpszT)

3. Save StatReg.h so the changes will be retained.

4. Rebuild the project with a Release MinDependency build configuration. (If you
  do not build with this option, you would have to add _ATL_STATIC_REGISTRY to
  the preprocessor definitions of the project so ATL would add the registration
  code to your project. You would also have to remove the _ATL_DLL preprocessor
  option. You do not have to add _ATL_STATIC_REGISTRY if you are building with
  a Release MinDependency build configuration because it is already defined.)

5. Rebuild the project.

By using the above steps, the registration code for any COM objects in the
project will be statically linked and will not use the incorrect code in
ATL.DLL. This will add about 10 KB to the size of the executable or DLL.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create an ATL object.

2. Register the object on a system that uses DBCS, such as the Japanese version
  of Windows NT 4.0.

3. Use Regedt32 to view the key under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT that your object added
  to see if the name is correct.

Additional query words: regsvr32 ATL.DLL registry CharNext
