-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Exchange Server version 5.5 Service Pack 2, the Connect-ME
SNADS Gateway from Icom Solutions Ltd. (formerly IMI Computing Ltd.) stops
working with a Dr. Watson error when delivering messages that are only addressed
using the Cc (Copy To) or Bcc (Blind Copy To) field.

CAUSE
=====

The Connect-ME SNADS Gateway from Icom Solutions Ltd. does not check the Cc
field. The original specification for Exchange Server stated that recipients
applicable to the gateway service (that is, in the message envelope) would only
be available in the To field. Exchange Server copied recipients from other
fields (Cc, Bcc) into the To field.

If Exchange Server version 5.5 Service Pack 2 is installed, this behavior no
longer occurs. This change in behavior is by design. For additional information
about problems that occur if Exchange Server copies recipients from the Cc and
Bcc fields into the To field, please click the article number below to view the
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q192519 XFOR: Field Moved to To: Field with MHS Extended Addressing

RESOLUTION
==========

To rectify the problem, Icom Solutions Ltd. is producing a code fix for the
Connect-ME SNADS Gateway (this may already be available). For more information
about the Connect-ME SNADS Gateway, refer to the follwing Web site:

  http://www.re-soft.com/releases/pr032796.htm

After you apply Exchange Server version 5.5 Service Pack 2, and until you apply
the Connect-ME SNADS Gateway fix, if you send mail, address it using only the To
field, and do not use the Cc or Bcc field alone.
