SYMPTOMS
========

On systems with the Role-Based user interface (UI) installed, a user who is a
member of the Server Managers group can run applications under the System
account. This results in the administrative credentials of the user being
elevated to local system administrator. Therefore, members of the Server
Managers group must be treated as members of the Administrators group.

RESOLUTION
==========

Administrators must not put users who are not trustworthy into the Server
Managers group.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Server Managers have full access to the Microsoft Internet Information Services
(IIS) Metabase through Active Directory Server Interfaces (ADSI) or Microsoft
Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) calls from Active Server Pages (ASP).
Web sites can be configured to run with full System privileges. Therefore,
members of the Server Managers group can gain Administrator access to the
server.

The role of the Server Managers can be used to limit the Web UI for a group of
users who must create Web sites and Web users. However, members of the Server
Managers group must be treated as having full administrative credentials.
