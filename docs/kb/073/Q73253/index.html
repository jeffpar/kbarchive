The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 3.3, 4.0, 4.01, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following procedure outlines the steps to remove Ontrack Disk Manager
versions 3.3 through 4.21 partitions from a hard drive to allow replacement with
MS-DOS FDISK partitions. The following script assumes that the first partition
on the hard disk is marked as bootable. Please note that if another partition is
marked as bootable, this procedure results in an unbootable system.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Locate the Ontrack Disk Manager program DM.EXE, and start it by typing the
  following command:

  " dm /m " (without the quotation marks)

2. Press P to enter the partitioning menu.

3. Press D to choose delete partition.

4. Disk Manager will prompt you with the message

  Enter partition number (n):

  where n equals the last partition number. Type in the number of the last
  partition (for example, if there are three partitions, enter "3" (without the
  quotation marks)).

5. Press ENTER to accept the default. This removes the last partition on the
  hard drive. You will see this partition removed from the list of partitions
  at the top of the screen.

6. Repeat steps 3-5 until only one partition remains on the list at the top of
  the screen.

  WARNING: Be careful not to delete all the partitions, which would leave you
  without a boot drive. If this occurs, press R to return to main menu, and
  respond NO to the following prompt

  Write the above partition data to the disk?

  by pressing N and then pressing the ENTER key.

7. After all partitions except the boot partition have been deleted, press R to
  return to the main menu.

8. At the following prompt, press Y, then press ENTER.

  Write the above partition data to the disk?

9. Press ESC to exit Disk Manager.

10. Press Y, then press ENTER key to verify that you want to exit Disk Manager.

11. Press ENTER to reboot the machine.

The hard drive is now ready to be partitioned using MS-DOS FDISK. This can be
done with the current version of MS-DOS, or after updating to MS-DOS 5.0.

The product included here, Disk Manager, is manufactured by a vendor independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this
