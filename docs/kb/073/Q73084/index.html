SUMMARY
=======

This article lists the improvements in QBasic over GW-BASIC and some of the
major differences between the two.

MORE INFORMATION
================

QBasic is a subset of QuickBasic version 4.5. The QBasic online help feature
contains complete articles explaining version differences between
BASICA/GW-BASIC and QBasic, unsupported keywords, and converting BASICA programs
for use under QBasic.

QBasic provides a "Windows-like" environment supporting the use of a mouse. A
menu bar across the top of the screen contains pull-down menu selections.

QBasic provides a split screen. The upper portion of the screen is called the
view window and is for program code; at the bottom of the screen, an "immediate"
window allows testing of a programming instruction prior to including it in a
program.

With QBasic, you don't need to use line numbers. However, line numbers are
supported. Also, QBasic now supports line "labels." These labels are not
required on every line, however, but can be used to direct program flow. As a
result, QBasic has no RENUM command such as that of GW-BASIC. For example:

  Line label "Bob:" or line number "10" are both valid.

QBasic includes friendly, extensive online help. For more information about using
QBasic, press ENTER immediately after starting QBasic or press F1 any time while
running QBasic. If you are using a mouse, point to the Help menu option on the
right side of the menu bar (on the top right of the displayed screen).

You can cut and paste examples of program code from the online help screen and
place them directly into the view window for execution.

QBasic uses IEEE floating point math, the industry standard. GW-BASIC uses the
MBF math format. For more information on IEEE vs. Microsoft Binary Format, query

QBasic is a subset of QuickBasic 4.5. QuickBasic 4.0 and later will support a
math co-processor, however, QBasic does not.

QBasic uses P-code, which stands for "pseudo code," so called because it's very
similar to compiled code, but it's not completely compiled. P-code retains just
enough information -- the crucial last bits that real machine code loses -- for
listing it on the screen in source code format and for any modifications you
decide to make. Yet, because it looks almost like the output of a compiler, it
runs almost as fast as you would expect an executable file to run. Consequently,
you get all the advantages of using an interpreter with virtually no speed
penalty and little size penalty.

QBasic supports additional variable types: User-Defined Types, Fixed-Length
Strings, and Long Integers.

User-Defined Types
------------------

                        Use the type
  If the variable is:    declaration character:
  -------------------    ----------------------

  String                 $
  Integer
     Regular             %
     Long                &amp;
  Floating Point
     Single-precision    !
     Double-precision    #

Fixed-Length Strings
--------------------

A regular integer variable can store any whole number from -32768 through

1. Use "%" to declare regular integers.

  Example: integer% = 10

To declare a fixed-length string, add a string variable name and a string length
to the DIM statement, as follows

     DIM strName AS STRING * n

where strName is the name of the fixed-length string and n is the string length.

Long Integers
-------------

A long integer variable can represent a whole number from -2,147,483,648 through
2,147,483,647. Use "&amp;" to declare long integers.

  Example: employees&amp; = 15000000

Single-precision floating-point variables can represent a number up to seven
digits in length. The decimal point can be anywhere within those digits. Use "!"
to declare single-precision floating-point variables.

  Example: speed!= 33.33333

Double-precision floating-point variables can represent a number up to 15 digits
in length. The decimal point can be anywhere within those digits. Use "#" to
declare double-precision floating point variables.

  Example: pi# = 3.141592654

QBasic allows 64K memory for code per subroutine and 64K for data. Arrays,
fixed-length strings, and user-defined types get 64K each. There is 64K of
memory available for CODE per SUBroutine and 64K of memory for DATA. You can
also have far arrays of numerics, fixed-length strings, and user- defined types
of up to 64K each.

QBasic allows error/event trapping:

           "ON ERROR GOSUB.../ON KEY(n) GOTO..."

          Example:
                          CALL mysub
                          END

                          errhandler:
                                  PRINT "You had an error!"
                                  PRINT "Error" ERR
                          RESUME NEXT

                          SUB mysub

                          ON ERROR GOTO errhandler
                          ERROR 62

                          END SUB

QBasic allows variable/value parameter passing. SUB/END SUB and UNCTION/END
FUNCTION. QBasic provides a way to share arguments with a limited number of
subprograms rather than with the entire program. This method is called passing
arguments.

          Syntax:
                  SUB globalname[parameterlist][STATIC]
                          [statements]
                  [EXIT SUB]
                          [statements]
                  FUNCTION name [parameterlist][STATIC]
                          [statements]
                  name = expression

                          [statements]
                  END FUNCTION
                  END SUB

File Conversion from GW-BASIC to QBasic
---------------------------------------

To use a GW-BASIC program in QBasic, you must first save the file in an ASCII
text format.

  Example: SAVE: "PROGNAME.BAS",A.

Converting a GW-BASIC Program to QBasic
---------------------------------------

Use REMLINE.BAS included with MS-DOS for QBasic to remove line numbers from
GW-BASIC programs. For more information, see the documentation provided at the
beginning of REMLINE.BAS by opening the file in QBasic.

To load GW-BASIC programs to QBasic, you must use the command "QBasic /MBF" when
starting QBasic from the DOS prompt.
