-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On a computer running a "Run from Network Server" installation of Word, if you
run Microsoft Word 97 Setup and click Remove All, you will see the following
message:

  &amp;Run From Network Server is a shared component, and there may be other
  applications using it. If you are sure you want to remove it, click the
  remove button. Otherwise, click the keep button.

  If you want to remove all shared components, click the Remove All button. If
  you do not want to remove any of shared components, click the Remove None
  button.

  [Keep] [Remove] [Remove None] [Remove All]

When you click Keep, Word is not removed from your computer. When you run the
Setup program again to try to remove Word, the following error message is
displayed:

  The Setup configuration file 'C:\PROGRA~1\MICROS~4\OFFICE\SETUP \Word97.stf'
  is missing or corrupted. Try running Setup again from where you originally
  ran it.

NOTE: This problem occurs when one or more Microsoft Office 97 applications (for
example Microsoft Word 97 for Windows and Microsoft Excel 97 for Windows) have
been set up as individual "Run from Network Server" programs. This problem does
not occur when you have performed the Microsoft Office 97 for Windows "Run from
Network Server" setup.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the following steps:

1. Re-install Word.

2. After Word has been re-installed, on the Windows Start menu, point to
  Settings, and then click Control Panel.

3. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

4. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click to select the application you want to
  remove, and then click the Add/Remove button.

  The Microsoft Word 97 Setup program will start.

5. In the Microsoft Word 97 Setup dialog box, click Remove All.

6. When you are prompted with the "Are you sure you want to remove Microsoft
  Word 97?", message, click Yes.

7. In the Remove Shared Component dialog box, you will see the first message
  "&amp;Run From Network Server" as described in the Symptoms section of this
  article. Click Remove or Remove All.

  NOTE: If you click Keep or Remove None, Microsoft Word 97 will not be removed
  from your computer and you will receive the second message as described in
  the "Symptoms" section of this article when you try to remove Word again.
