-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If the WillExecute event is used to set the CursorType property, the resultset
for the cursor may contain nothing if the CursorType has not been set before the
WillExecute event fires. Setting a Remote Data Control resultset equal to the
query resultset will cause the error:

  "runtime error" 40516 Invalid Object"

CAUSE
=====

The CursorType property is set but will only affect subsequent queries. The
CursorType property is not set for the query that caused the WillExecute event
to fire.

RESOLUTION
==========

Set the CursorType and LockType properties before running the query.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The purpose of the WillExecute event is to allow modifications of a query's SQL
or to allow a query to be cancelled. All query properties can be modified here,
but changing some properties will not affect the current query that caused the
event to fire. CursorType and LockType are two properties that cannot be changed
for the current query. Changing other properties, such as SQL and maxrow, will
affect the resultset returned by the current query that caused the event to
fire.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a new project. Select Microsoft Remote Data Object 2.0 under project
  references.

2. Under project components, check Microsoft Databound Grid and Microsoft
  RemoteData Control 2.0.

3. Add a Remote Data Control, a Databound grid and a CommandButton to the form.
  Set the Datasource property of the grid to MSRDC1.

4. Put the following code in the Declarations section of the form:

  NOTE: Before running the code, change the server in the connect statement to a
  server near you.

        Option Explicit
        Dim rs As rdoResultset
        Dim WithEvents cn As rdoConnection
        Dim SQL As String

        Private Sub cn_WillExecute(ByVal Query As RDO.rdoQuery, _
               Cancel As Boolean)
          MsgBox Query.CursorType
          Query.CursorType = rdOpenStatic
          MsgBox Query.CursorType   'the cursortype has been changed
        End Sub

        Private Sub Form_Load()
          Set cn = New rdoConnection

          cn.Connect = "ucn.Connect = "uid=sa;pwd=;server=margerys;" _
          &amp; "driver={SQL &amp; "driver={SQL Server};database=pubs;" _
          &amp; "DSN='';" &amp; "DSN='';"

          cn.CursorDriver = rdUseOdbc
          cn.EstablishConnection rdDriverNoPrompt
          SQL = "Select *  From titles "
          '
          ' Openresultset cause the WillExecute event to fire.
          '
          Set rs = cn.OpenResultset(SQL)
          '
          'The next command will fail because a remote data control
          '  cannot be assigned to nothing. rs is nothing because
          '  because the CursorType has not been set for the current query.
          '
          'Set rs = cn.OpenResultset(SQL,rdopenforwardonly)
          '
          'Uncomment the above line and comment the first 'set rs' and
          '  the problem will persist because a remote data control cannot
          '  be assigned to a forwardonly cursor.
          '
          Set MSRDC1.Resultset = rs
        End Sub

        Private Sub quit_Click()
          rs.Close
          Set rs = Nothing
          cn.Close
          Set cn = Nothing
          Unload Me
        End Sub

5. In the code above, if you switch openstatic and openforwardonly, note that
  the code will run and the grid will be filled. You can also experiment with
  the LockType property, changing it from rdConcurReadOnly to rdConcurRowVer,
  and testing to note changes when you can edit the grid.
