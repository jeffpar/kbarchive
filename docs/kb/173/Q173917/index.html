The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========


If you are using the Pine POP3 client running against an Exchange Server 5.5
computer, when you attempt to send Internet mail, you may find that the Windows
NT domain and user name are included in your Internet address.

If you enter the following user ID

  NT_Domain_Name\NT_User_Name\Exchange_Alias_Name

and the user domain "server.domain," you will be able to log on to the IMAP
server and retrieve messages. But when a message is sent to the Internet, the
address will be constructed as follows:

  &lt;NT_Domain_Name\NT_User_Name\Exchange_Alias_Name@server.domain&gt;

Pine constructs the Internet address from the user ID and user domain entered in
the Pine Setup Configuration menu. Pine does not offer a separate entry for
Internet address. It always constructs the address from the user ID and user
domain entered in the configuration.

CAUSE
=====

There may be other clients that do the same thing to construct the Internet
address. If you will be using Pine (or any other client that does the same
thing), make sure your Exchange Server alias (mail account) is the same as your
Windows NT user name (domain account). In this way, you can log on with just
user name and password.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem in Pine:

- To be able to configure the From field, Pine must be recompiled with the
  option /d ALLOW_CHANGING_FROM.

There is no Microsoft-centered solution to the problem.
