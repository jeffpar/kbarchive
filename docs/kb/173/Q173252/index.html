SYMPTOMS
========

CArchive::GetObjectSchema returns the schema of the object loading the
serialized information rather than the schema of the object being loaded. This
occurs only when an object with a schema greater than 0 loads an object with a
schema equal to 0 and the object being loaded is not the first of this type.

CAUSE
=====

When the first object of a type that has a schema of 0 is loaded, the value of
the CArchive member, m_nObjectSchema, is set to a value of 0. When further
objects of the same type are loaded, m_nObjectSchema is set to the schema of the
object loading the serialized information.

This behavior is due to the way CArchive::ReadClass determines the schema of a
type that has already been stored. This is done in the following code located
toward the end of CArchive::ReadClass:

     // determine schema stored against objects of this type
     void* pTemp;
     if (m_pSchemaMap != NULL &amp;&amp;
        (pTemp = m_pSchemaMap-&gt;GetValueAt(pClassRef)) != NULL)
        nSchema = (UINT)pTemp;
     else
     nSchema = pClassRef-&gt;m_wSchema &amp; ~VERSIONABLE_SCHEMA;

When the schema of a type that has already been loaded is 0 the value returned
from GetValueAt is 0 and the else part of the if statement is executed. This
sets the value of the schema for the object being loaded as the schema of the
existing object.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are two ways to work around this issue:

- Do not use a schema of 0 to serialize object information. This is the
  simplest solution but may not be practical if objects of schema 0 must be
  maintained.

-or-

- Set a flag when you load objects of schema 0. This flag should be considered
  when testing for schema number when using Archive::GetObjectSchema. The time
  to set this flag is when the first object with schema 0 is being loaded.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been fixed in Visual Studio 97 Service
Pack 3.
