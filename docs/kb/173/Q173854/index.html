The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Microsoft Word, when you save a document as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML),
if the document contains images inserted in an Image Submit Form Field ActiveX
control, you cannot view the images in a Web browser, such as Microsoft Internet
Explorer.

This problem occurs with images in the following formats:

- Windows Metafile (WMF)

- Portable Network Graphics (PNG)

CAUSE
=====

When you save the document, Word does not convert WMF and PNG images to Graphics
Interchange Format (GIF); however, your Web browser cannot display WMF or PNG
images.

WORKAROUND
==========

To use a WMF or PNG image file in an Image Submit Form Field control, use either
of the following methods.

Method 1: Save the Image in the Body of an HTML Document
--------------------------------------------------------

1. After you insert the WMF or PNG image into your Word document, convert the
  Word document to HTML format by following these steps:

  a. Click Save on the File menu.

  b. In the Save As Type list, click to select HTML Document.

  c. Click Save.

  NOTE: Word coverts the WMF or PNG to GIF images. As Word converts these
  images, it assigns a file name such as Image1.gif, Image2.gif, Image3.gif,
  and so on. Word saves these files in the same directory as your HTML
  document.

2. If you want to rename the Image&lt;X&gt;.gif files, follow these steps:

  a. Click Open on the File menu, and click All Files(*.*) in the Files Of Type
     list.

  b. Use the right mouse button to click (right-click) the Image&lt;X&gt;.gif
     file, and then click Rename on the shortcut menu.

  c. Type a new name for the file and then press ENTER.

3. When you insert the image into the Image Submit Form Field control, use the
  file from step 2.

Method 2: Use a Graphics Program to Convert the Graphic Format to GIF
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Use a graphics program to export the WMF or PNG images to the GIF or JPEG (JPG)
image format, and then insert the GIF or JPEG image into the Image Submit Form
Field control.

To convert the image, you can use the Microsoft Paint program that comes with
Microsoft Windows, and the Microsoft Photo Editor program that comes with
Microsoft Office 97.

Use the appropriate method for your situation.

WMF Image:

To convert a WMF image using Microsoft Paint and Microsoft Photo Editor, follow
these steps:

1. In Word 97, click to select the WMF graphic, and then click Copy on the Edit
  menu.

2. Save the image as a bitmap in Microsoft Paint. To do this, follow these
  steps:

  a. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then click
     Paint.

  b. In Microsoft Paint, click Paste on the Edit menu. Click Yes if you receive
     the following prompt:

  The image in the clipboard is larger than this bitmap. Would you like the
  bitmap enlarged?

  c. On the File menu, click Save.

  d. In the Save As dialog box, navigate to the folder that contains your HTML
     document, type a file name, and then click Save to save the file as a
     bitmap.

  e. Quit Microsoft Paint by clicking Exit on the File menu.

3. Start Microsoft Photo Editor. To do this, click Start, point to Programs, and
  then click Microsoft Photo Editor.

4. In Microsoft Photo Editor, click Open on the File menu, and then open the
  bitmap file you created in step 2.

5. Click Save As on the File menu. In the Save As Type list, click to select
  GIF, type a file name, and then click Save.

6. On the File menu, click Exit, and then switch to Microsoft Word.

When you insert the graphic into the Image Submit Form Field Control, use the
file you created in step 5.

PNG Image:

To convert a PNG image using Microsoft Photo Editor, follow these steps:

1. Start Microsoft Photo Editor. To do this, click Start, point to Programs, and
  then click Microsoft Photo Editor.

2. In Microsoft Photo Editor, click Open on the File menu, and then open the PNG
  file.

3. On the File menu, click Save As. In the Save As Type list, click to select
  GIF, type a file name, and then Click Save.

4. On the File menu, click Exit, and then switch to Microsoft Word.

When you insert the graphic into the Image Submit Form Field Control, use the
file you created in step 3.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Forms on Web Pages
------------------

When authoring a Web page, you can use ActiveX controls to create forms for
collecting or providing dynamic data. The controls are standard form elements
used on the World Wide Web.

Because forms require additional support files and therefore additional server
support, you should consult your network or Web administrator when designing the
form.

Every form must have one Submit or Image Submit button.

Image Submit:

This control provides a Picture dialog box that allows you to select the image
you want. When you copy the Web page to the server, you must also copy the
button image.

Submit:

This control submits the data that the user types into other form elements.

For more information about the Web page form elements that are installed with
Word, click the Office Assistant, type "image submit control," click Search, and
then click the "Form elements you can use on a Web page" topic.

NOTE: If the Assistant is hidden, click the Office Assistant button on the
Standard toolbar. If Word Help is not installed on your computer, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Graphic Filters
---------------

This section further describes the types of graphic filters mentioned in this
article. Graphic filters allow you to use graphics formats in various ways
within Word.

Windows Metafile (WMF):

The Windows Metafile graphics filter (Wmfimp32.flt) supports the Windows Metafile
format. You must have the Windows Metafile filter to insert a WMF file into a
Word document as a Microsoft Clip Gallery object. However, you don't need the
filter to insert a WMF file directly into a Word document.

Portable Network Graphics (PNG):

The Portable Network Graphics filter (Png32.flt) supports the Portable Network
Graphics tenth specification (version 1.0). You must have the filter to insert a
PNG file into a Word document as a Microsoft Clip Gallery object or a Photo
Editor object. However, you don't need the filter to insert a PNG file directly
into a Word document. You must also have the PNG filter to import GIF files into
Word.

Graphics Interchange Format (GIF):

The Graphics Interchange Format filter (Gifimp32.flt) supports file format
versions GIF87a (including interlacing) and GIF89a (including interlacing and
transparency). The GIF filter works with the Portable Network Graphics filter to
import GIF files into Word. The HTML converter also uses the GIF filter to
export pictures in a Word document to GIF images in an HTML page.

NOTE: A limitation of the GIF filter is that it only imports the first image of a
multi-image GIF file.

JPEG File Interchange Format file (JPG):

The JPEG graphics filter (Jpegim32.flt) supports Version 6.0 of the JPEG File
Interchange Format (JFIF). You must have the JPEG filter to insert a JPEG file
into a Word document as a Microsoft Clip Gallery object or a Photo Editor
object. However you don't need the JPEG filter to insert a JPEG file directly
into a Word document.

The JPEG filter has the following limitations:

- The filter does not support JPEG Tagged Interchange Format (JTIF) files.

- The filter does not support cyan-magenta-yellow-black (CMYK) JPEG files.

For more information about other graphic filters that Word can use, click the
Office Assistant, type "graphic filters," click Search, and then click the
"Graphic file types Word can use" topic.
