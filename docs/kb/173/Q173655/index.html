The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When the SNA Windows NT Client, version 3.0, is installed on the Finnish version
of Windows NT Workstation, sponsor connections may fail when connecting to SNA
Server 2.11. The Windows NT application log on the SNA Server contains many
occurrences of an event ID 705, similar to the following:

  User: NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM
  Event ID: 705
  Source: SNA Base Service
  Type: Warning

The description is:

  Security Error: Invalid Challenge Response, subcode 002B000AH.
  EXPLANATION
  Connection request failed due to a security error.
  ACTION
  Contact your network support personnel.

If a high number of connection attempts are made, the performance of the computer
running SNA Server may degrade to such an extent that it appears to stop
responding and CPU utilization may be observed at 100 percent.

CAUSE
=====

The problem relates to the localized form of the LocalSystem account. When it is
localized in the Finnish version of Windows NT, it appears as "JsrjestelmSTili."
Using SNA Server 2.11, an error occurs when it attempts to obtain the
LocalSystem account name, which results in SYSTEM being incorrectly returned as
the LocalSystem account.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

- Configure the SNABase service to run under a custom user account that has
  been granted the advanced user right "Act as part of the Operating System" to
  allow the normal operation Challenge/Response messages.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0 and 3.0
Service Pack 1 (SP1). This problem was corrected in the latest SNA Server
version 3.0 U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining this Service Pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

  S E R V P A C K

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the fix applied, the LocalSystem account is returned correctly.
