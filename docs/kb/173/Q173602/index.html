- Scholastic's Magic School Bus series: Explores the Rainforest for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following article describes how to play the games included with Scholastic's
Magic School Bus Explores the Rainforest.

GAME DESCRIPTIONS

Night Stratification Game
-------------------------

Location: Canopy - From outside the bus in the Canopy area, click the Howler
monkey (upper right), and then click the Sun.

Description: You are given a group of animals to put into the environment. When
you place an animal in the right location (high canopy, leafy middle, or
understory), an animation will play to show that the animal belongs there. If
the animal is put in the wrong location an animation will play to show that this
is not the correct place for that animal. Next, another animal comes out and
scares the current animal away, allowing you to try again. As you play this game
the sun will slowly rise, serving as the game's time limit.

Hide and Species Puzzle
-----------------------

Location: Left Understory - From outside the bus in the Understory area, move the
mouse cursor about one inch along the left edge of screen until it turns into a
large arrow pointing to the left (over a frog on a silvery log). Click on the
animal tracks (three-toed bird) to the right of the tree trunk, and then click
on the brown leaf mimic on the lower right.

Description: In this game you are to place animals in their appropriate "hidden"
positions in the environment. Once the animal is in its correct position their
"song" or animation will be activated. Drag the puzzle pieces to the correct
location. If you are stuck on a piece, click one of the arrows to choose another
piece.

Ant Antics Game
---------------

Location: Left Understory - From outside the bus in the Understory area, move the
mouse cursor about one inch along the left edge of screen until it turns into a
large arrow pointing to the left (over a frog on a silvery log). Click on the
leaf over the lizard (left side), and then click on the ants.

Description: You control a group of ants moving over leafy terrain. The ants need
to collect food for their queen while making their way through the maze of
obstacles that obstruct their path. Use the arrow keys to move your group of
ants along the dots (not between). When a crown appears, grab it, and then go to
the large ant waving the flag.

Escaping Monkey Game
--------------------

Location: Canopy - From outside the bus in the Canopy area, click on the Howler
monkey (upper right) then click on the Spider monkey.

Description: This is an arcade style game where you control a monkey that is
trying to get from tree to tree in order to get out of danger from the harpy
eagle flying above. You must guide the monkey over branches and vines in order
to reach safety. Watch out for the snakes and broken limbs during the game.
Point to the bullseye, which indicates your next jump. Hold your mouse button
down for the desired jump strength (indicated by the red "power" bar). When you
think you have enough jump strength, release the mouse button.

Helicopter Damselfly Game (Heli-Fly)
------------------------------------

Location: Canopy - From outside the bus in the Canopy area, click on the iguana
then click on the damselfly.

Description: This is an arcade style game where you control the flying damselfly
as it moves left to right catching insects for food and power while dropping its
eggs into bromeliads for extra points. You must watch out for the damselfly's
enemy or the game can end. Use the space bar to drop eggs on open flowers to
color all their leaves green. Don't let the spiders get away, or you'll fall.

Birdfood Game
-------------

Location: Canopy - From outside the bus in the Canopy area, click on the iguana
then click on the jacamar (middle right).

Description: This is an arcade style game where you try to catch palatable
butterflies for the Roufus tailed jacamar and avoid eating too many poisonous
ones. A hawk predator is pursuing the jacamar. You must try to eat a healthy
diet, without becoming a healthy meal for the jacamar's enemy! Click the mouse
where you would like Jackie to fly.

Rain Game
---------

Location: Canopy - From outside the bus in the Canopy area, click on the Howler
monkey (upper right) then click on the beetle.

Description: This is an arcade style game where you control a beetle high in the
canopy, as it tries to avoid being hit by raindrops. Move left or right or one
step up with the arrow keys to catch the falling treasures.

Mites Travel Game
-----------------

Location: Treefall Gap - From outside the bus in the Treefall Gap area, click the
piper plant (lower left) then click on the hummingbird.

Description: This is a game where you must work quickly to get as many mites
inside the nose of a hummingbird, before it flies away. The mites are inside a
flower when the large head of a hummingbird pops in. You must control the mites,
picking them up and putting them inside the nose of the bird before it leaves.
Once a certain number of mites have successfully entered the nose of the bird,
the bird will fly off to another flower moving you to new level. You will see
the view of the bird's flight through the small holes in the bird's beak.
