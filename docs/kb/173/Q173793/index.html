SYMPTOMS
========

When using system policies with client computers running Windows 95 or Windows
NT 4.0, defining a "Custom Programs Folder" may keep Program Group Control (PGC)
from successfully configuring a user's desktop with the program group(s) and
shared application(s) that they would normally receive.

The information in this article may also be useful to anyone that is implementing
features associated with the Zero Administration for Windows (ZAW) Initiative.

CAUSE
=====

When the System Policy Editor is used to define a common Programs folder for
multiple users, those users will often not have the necessary permissions to
modify this directory structure.

Because PGC runs under the context of the user, it may fail to configure the
program groups. Given the proper permissions, PGC will successfully configure
the Programs folder even if it is located on a server.

WORKAROUND
==========

To deliver a custom desktop through system policies and also use PGC, use the
Custom Start Menu option instead of the Custom Programs Folder.

NOTE: When using the Custom Start Menu, the Hide Start Menu Subfolders option
must be disabled. Otherwise, the custom group under the Start button will not
appear.

To use the Custom Start Menu option, perform the following steps:

1. Create a custom Start menu at a server location and create an Applications
  folder directly beneath the Start menu. It is best to use a structure similar
  to the following:

  \\&lt;server_name&gt;\&lt;share&gt;\Start Menu\Applications

  You can then add other folders and shortcuts underneath the Applications
  folder.

2. From the System Policy Editor, click to select the Custom Start Menu option
  and define the common location for the custom Start menu. To continue the
  previous example, this would be:

  \\&lt;server_name&gt;\&lt;share&gt;\Start Menu

When the user's desktop is configured as a result of the system policy, he or she
will have an Applications group above the Programs group in the Start menu.

This configuration allows an administrator to use system policies to deliver
custom desktop applications to their users while maintaining a local Programs
folder that PGC can modify successfully.
