SUMMARY
=======

This article describes what cross-references are, how to create them, how to
edit them, how to update them. It also describes how cross-references are
enhanced in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

What Is a Cross-reference?
--------------------------

The cross-reference feature in Word allows you to create a cross-reference that
refers to an item in either the same document or a different document, for
example, "See Table 6 on page 22." If the item in the cross-reference changes,
for example, if Table 6 becomes Table 5, or Table 6 moves to page 23, you can
update the cross-reference field without retyping it.

What You See in the Cross-reference Dialog Box
----------------------------------------------

This section defines the items that you see when you click Cross-reference on the
Insert menu.

Reference Type:

The Reference Type list lets you select the type of item you want to cross-
reference. Word allows you to cross-reference the following items:

  Item                    Description
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Numbered Item           If your document contains numbered paragraphs
                          (numbered headings or list items), as in a
                          legal document that contains outline numbered
                          list items or ListNum fields, you can create
                          a cross-reference to the paragraph number.

  Heading                 Text that is formatted with one of the nine
                          heading styles that come with Word.

  Bookmark                Text that is marked by using the Bookmark
                          command on the Edit menu.

  Footnote                Footnote reference marks inserted in a document
                          by using the Footnote command on the Insert
                          menu.

  Endnote                 Endnote reference marks inserted in a document
                          by using the Footnote command on the Insert
                          menu.

  Figure/Table/Equation   A caption inserted with one of the preceding
                          labels by using the Caption command on the
                          Insert menu.

Insert Reference To:

The Insert Reference To list lets you identify the information you want to appear
in the cross-reference. These choices depend on your selection in the Reference
Type list. All of the possible choices are listed below.

  Item                    Description
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Heading Text            Inserts the text of the heading.

  Heading Number          Inserts the number of the heading.

  Page Number             Inserts the number of the page containing the
                          item.
                          NOTE: For footnotes and endnotes, the page
                          number that appears in the cross-reference is
                          the location of the footnote or endnote text,
                          not the location of the note reference mark.

  Paragraph Number        Inserts the paragraph number of a bookmark.
                          See the "More About Paragraph Number" section
                          later in this Article for more details.

  Bookmark Text           Inserts text marked with a bookmark.

  Footnote Number         Inserts a footnote reference mark.

  Footnote Number         Inserts a formatted footnote reference mark.
  (formatted)

  Endnote Number          Inserts an endnote reference mark.

  Endnote number          Inserts a formatted endnote reference mark.
  (formatted)

  Entire Caption          Inserts the label, number, and any additional
                          text of a caption, for example, Table 1:
                          International Air Distances. Applies only to
                          Equations, Figures, and Tables.

  Only Label And Number   Inserts only the label and number of a caption,
                          for example, Table 1. Applies only to Equations,
                          Figures, and Tables.

  Only Caption Text       Inserts only the additional text you have added
                          to a caption, for example, International Air
                          Distances. Applies only to Equations, Figures,
                          and Tables.

  Above/Below             Inserts the words Above or Below as appropriate,
                          for example, See Table: Above.

Insert As Hyperlink:

If you select this check box, Word creates a cross-reference that is a hyperlink.
That is, if you click the cross-reference, Word scrolls to the referenced item
in the document. You can also use the navigation buttons on the Web toolbar to
move between related paragraphs.

For Which &lt;Reference Type&gt;:

This area lets you select the specific item you want to refer to. For example, if
you select Footnote in the Reference Type box, this area is called "For which
footnote," and displays all of the footnotes in the document.

Insert:

Inserts the cross-reference at the insertion point in the document. The
cross-reference dialog box remains open so that you can insert additional
cross-references.

Close:

Closes the cross-reference dialog box.

More About Paragraph Number
---------------------------

This section describes the three different types of paragraph number references
you can insert from the Insert Reference To list.

Paragraph Number:

Displays the paragraph number and its relative position in an outline numbered
list.

Example 1:

A cross-reference in 1.(a)(i) to paragraph 1.(a)(ii) appears as "(ii)" because
both paragraphs are under 1.(a)

Numbered List 1
     (a) Second Level under Numbered List 1
            (i)  SEE REFERENCE:  (ii)
            (ii) Second Item in Third Level of Numbered List 1

Example 2:

A cross-reference 2.(a)(i) to 1.(a)(i) appears as "1.(a)(i)," because no context
is shared between the paragraphs; that is, they are in completely different
sections.

Numbered List 1
    (a) Second Level under Numbered List 1
           (i) Third Level, under Numbered List 1
Numbered List 2
    (a) Second Level under Numbered List 2
           (i) SEE REFERENCE:  1.(a)(i)

Paragraph Number (No Context):

Displays the paragraph number without its relative position in the outline
numbered list.

For example, a cross-reference in Paragraph 2.(a)(i) to paragraph 1.(a)(ii)
appears as "(ii)", regardless of the context of the reference.

Numbered List 1
     (a) Second Level under Numbered List 1
            (i)  Third Level, under Numbered List 1
            (ii) Third Level, under Numbered List 1
Numbered List 2
     (a) Second Level under Numbered List 2
            (i) SEE REFERENCE:  (ii)

Paragraph Number (Full Context):

Displays the complete paragraph number from anywhere in the document.

For example, a cross-reference from anywhere in a document to paragraph 1.(a)(ii)
appears as "1.(a)(ii)" in the cross-reference.

Numbered List 1
     (a) Second Level under Numbered List 1
            (i)  SEE REFERENCE:  1.(a)(ii)
            (ii) Second Item in Third Level of Numbered List 1

NOTE: This is similar to what WordPerfect versions 6.1 and earlier use.

How to Create a Cross-reference in the Same Document
----------------------------------------------------

If the item you want to refer to is located in the current document, follow these
steps.

NOTE: For this example, your document must contain at least one of the following:
a table with a caption, a footnote, an endnote, an equation with a caption, a
bookmark, a figure with a caption, or a paragraph formatted with a heading or a
numbering style.

1. In the document, type the introductory text that begins the cross-reference.
  For example, type the following: " For more information, see:" (without the
  quotation marks)

2. On the Insert menu, click Cross-reference.

3. In the Reference type list, click the type of item you want to refer to, for
  example, a Heading or Table.

4. In the Insert reference to list, click the information you want to insert
  into the document, for example, Heading Text.

5. In the For Which &lt;Reference Type&gt; list, click the specific item you
  want to refer to. For example, if you click Heading in the Reference type box
  and the document has six headings, click the heading that you want to refer
  to.

6. Click Insert and then click Close.

NOTE: If you see an entry that looks something like {REF _Ref249586 \*
MERGEFORMAT} instead of text, Word is displaying field codes instead of field
results. To see the field results, press ALT+F9.

How to Create a Cross-reference to Another Document
---------------------------------------------------

If the item you want to refer to is located in another document, follow these
steps.

NOTE: Both documents must be subdocuments in the same master document.

1. Open the master document that contains both subdocuments.

2. Click the Expand Subdocuments button on the Master Document toolbar.

3. On the View menu, click Normal.

4. Follow the steps outlined in "How to Create a Cross-reference in the Same
  Document" section earlier in this article.

How to Edit What a Cross-reference Refers To
--------------------------------------------

1. Select the cross-reference in the document, for example, "Figure 1."

  NOTE: Do not select the introductory text; for example, do not select "For
  more information, see." To modify the introductory text in a Cross-
  reference, edit the text in the document.

2. On the Insert menu, click Cross-reference.

3. Make sure the Reference Type list contains the type of cross-reference you
  are editing, and make sure the For Which &lt;Reference Type&gt; list contains
  the correct item.

4. Under Insert Reference To, click the new item you want to refer to.

5. Click Insert and then click Close.

How to Update a Cross-reference
-------------------------------

To update cross-references, use either of the following methods.

Method 1: Update All Cross-references:

To update all cross-references in a document, click Select All on the Edit menu
and then press F9.

Method 2: Update One Cross-reference:

To update a single cross-reference in a document, select the cross- reference and
press F9.
