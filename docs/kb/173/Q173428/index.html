SUMMARY
=======

The comment feature in Microsoft Word 97 replaces the annotation feature in
earlier versions of Microsoft Word. This article explains what the Word 97
comment feature is, as well as how to insert, delete, edit, and print comments
in your document.

MORE INFORMATION
================

What Are Comments?
------------------

A comment is a note or an annotation that an author or reviewer adds to a
document.

The comment feature inserts a comment marker in hidden text format at the
insertion point and displays a comments pane in which to enter comments. The
comment marker contains your initials and a number, for example [INT1].

You can also have Word highlight the comment markers in yellow, and have a
ScreenTip appear containing the text and creator of the comment, when you rest
the mouse pointer over the comment marker.

Word 97 also includes a Reviewing toolbar that contains all the tools for working
with comments. To display this toolbar, point to Toolbars on the View menu, and
then click to select Reviewing.
