SYMPTOMS
========

When you customize an Outline Numbered format in your Word document, an unwanted
tab stop may appear as in the following cases.

Case 1
------

After you customize an outline numbered scheme, promoting or demoting a numbered
paragraph may insert an unwanted tab stop between the number and the beginning
of the paragraph text. Attempting to use default tab stop settings (on the
Format menu, click Tabs) by clearing all custom tab stops results in the custom
tab stops being cleared only temporarily.

NOTE: To promote or demote a numbered paragraph, use the Increase Indent or
Decrease Indent buttons.

When you do this, the tab space between the number and the beginning of the
paragraph text will be different from the way they were formatted in the
customized Outline Numbered scheme.


Case 2
------

If you create a new style with a customized Outline Numbered format (on the
Format menu, click "Bullets and Numbering"), Word may include an extra tab
setting with the style when you add the style to the template.

NOTE: To view the description of your custom style, click Style on the Format
menu, click to select your custom style in the Style dialog box and then view
the Description.

For additional information about a similar problem when you create a custom style
that contains a Bulleted or Numbered format, click the article number below to
view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q206596 WD97: Bulleted/Numbered Style Added to Template Shows Additional Tab
  Stop


CAUSE
=====

This functionality is by design of Microsoft Word. Word may add an additional
0.25" default value to the tab following the number of the outline numbered
style that you customize.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use one of the following methods appropriate for
your situation.

Case 1 Workarounds
------------------

Method 1: Clear All Tabs BEFORE Applying the Numbering:

To do this, follow these steps:

1. On the Format menu, click Tabs.

2. Click Clear All, and then click OK.

3. Apply the numbering.

Method 2: Clear All Tabs AFTER Applying the Numbering:

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Select the Outline Numbered list.

2. On the Format menu, click Tabs.

3. Click Clear All, and then click OK.

NOTE: This is not a permanent resolution. If you make additional changes to
promote or demote paragraphs, Word inserts the unwanted tab stops again.

Method 3: Use a Macro:

article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q173707 OFF97: How to Run Sample Code from Knowledge Base Articles

You can use the following Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications sample code to
demote or promote levels, and to clear the unwanted tab stops.

  Sub ListOutdent()
     Selection.Range.ListFormat.ListOutdent
     Selection.ParagraphFormat.TabStops.ClearAll
     ActiveDocument.DefaultTabStop = InchesToPoints(0.5)
  End Sub

  Sub ListIndent()
     Selection.Range.ListFormat.ListIndent
     Selection.ParagraphFormat.TabStops.ClearAll
     ActiveDocument.DefaultTabStop = InchesToPoints(0.5)
  End Sub

Case 2 Workarounds
------------------

Method 1: Use the Organizer:

Copy the new custom style to your template by using the Organizer. To do this,
follow these steps:

1. On the Format menu, click Style.

2. In the Style dialog box, click Organizer.

3. On one side of the Styles tab, open your document that contains your custom
  style, and on the other side, open the template that you want to copy the
  style to.

4. On the document side, click to select the style that you want to copy and
  click Copy.

  Word copies your new custom style to the template that you specified.

5. Click Close to close the Organizer dialog box.

Method 2: Create the Style in Your Custom Template:

Instead of creating your custom style in a Word document and selecting the "Add
to template" check box, open your template and create the custom style directly
in the template, the same way that you would in a Word document. For more
information about how to create a custom style, please see the "More
Information" section of this article.

Method 3: Set the "Follow number with" Box To Nothing:

To prevent the additional tab from being added to your custom Outline Numbered
style, set the "Follow number with" box to Nothing. To do this, follow these
steps:

1. Open your document containing your custom Outline Numbered style.

2. On the Format menu, click "Bullets and Numbering".

3. In the Style dialog box, click to select your custom style and then click
  Modify.

4. In the Modify Style dialog box, click Format and then click Numbering.

5. On the Outline Numbered tab, your customized outline numbered style should be
  selected. Click Customize.

6. In the Customize Outline Numbered List dialog box, click to select each
  outline level (levels 1 - 9), and click to change the "Follow number with"
  box for each level to Nothing.

7. Repeat step 6 for each level of your customized outline numbered scheme.

8. Click OK to close the Customize Outline Numbered List dialog box.

9. In the Modify Style dialog box, click to select the "Add to template" check
  box.

  NOTE: You do not need to select the "Add to template" check box if you are
  changing your customized outline numbered style directly in your custom
  template.

10. Click OK to close the Modify Style dialog box.

11. Click Close to close the Style dialog box.
