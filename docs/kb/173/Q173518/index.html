-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message as your computer restarts:

  Stop: 0xC000012F STATUS_INVALID_IMAGE_NOT_MZ

  The specified image file did not have the correct format, it did not have an
  initial MZ.

This error may also occur following installation of new drivers to the system,
such as adding a new video driver, or is often seen during either an upgrade or
new installation of Windows NT.

CAUSE
=====

This error is caused by the system being unable to load a needed file because of
the file being corrupted. This usually occurs during the file copy process, and
is often because of a hardware malfunction. It may be a one-time occurrence, but
often is a signal for the user to do a through examination of system hardware to
determine what is causing the corruption.

NOTE: The parameter 0xc000012f may also be seen in conjunction with other Trap
Codes such as 0x0000006b and is usually shown as the first parameter following
the trap:

  STOP 0x0000006b (0xc000012f, 0xxxxxxxxx, 0xxxxxxxxx,0xxxxxxxxx)

WORKAROUND
==========

Because this trap code is caused by a corrupted file required to load Windows
NT, and the trap screen does not always reference which specific file caused the
problem, the best solution is usually basic trouble shooting.

It is recommended to have a good back up of anything on the computer that the
user considers valuable before proceeding with the different procedures.

Windows NT was Already Installed and Running
--------------------------------------------

If the stop error occurred following a change in hardware drivers, press the
space bar to select the Last Known Good option during startup, and then change
the necessary components when the computer comes up.

Try selecting [VGA MODE] option from the boot menu, this will display the Windows
NT system files on the screen as they are loaded and may give you a clue about
which file is corrupt.

Use the Emergency Repair Disk to replace the missing or damaged driver file on
the partition by following the procedure outlined in the following Microsoft
Knowledge Base articles:

ARTICLE-ID: Q103280
TITLE : Using an Emergency Repair Disk Created by Windows NT

ARTICLE-ID: Q164471
TITLE : Replacing System Files Using a Modified Emergency Repair Disk

This will allow you to perform a system repair to replace the corrupted Windows
NT system file.

If Performing an Initial Windows NT Installation or Upgrade
-----------------------------------------------------------

If the computer has MS-DOS or another operating system installed, copy the i386
directory from the Windows NT installation CD to C:\i386, and at a command
prompt carry out the following command:

WINNT /b.

This often allows the installation to proceed, but if Windows NT will not install
in this manner, you may want to consider the following options:

- When installing on a new computer with little or nothing else on it, reformat
  the hard drive and install using the three setup disks, or booting with DOS,
  copying the i386 directory, and carry out a WINNT /b command as above. If you
  are using the three setup disks, consider making a new set using the WINNT
  /ox switch to help eliminate the possibility of a bad floppy disk.

- Disable caching options and BIOS shadowing.

- Removing all possible hardware to take the computer down to a bare box with
  only one hard drive and controller in order to eliminate possible hardware
  conflicts.

- Ask the computers' manufacturer if a newer System BIOS is available, if so,
  flash the BIOS using the manufacturers instructions.

Because this error is usually associated with hardware, it is recommended to
troubleshoot the computer from that stand point, including the motherboard,
controller, memory, hard drive, and CD-ROM drive.
