MORE INFORMATION
================

Page xix: Incorrect Area Code
-----------------------------

Page xix, first paragraph:
Change: (206)-462-9673
To: (425)-462-9673


Pages 61, 63, 74, 129: Miscellaneous Corrections
------------------------------------------------

Page 61:
Delete first step 2 ("Press BACKSPACE to left align the insertion...")
Renumber steps appropriately.

Page 63, step 5:
Change: "In the Tabs Stop Position list, click 3.5"..."
To: "In the Tabs Stop Position List, click 3"..."

Page 74:
Insert steps after step 5:
Step 6: On the Tools menu, click Options.
Step 7: Select the View tab. In the Nonprinting Characters field, choose All and
then click OK.

Renumber step 6 to step 8.

Page 129, first step 4:
Change: "...click the Indent down arrow..."
To: "...click the Indent left down arrow..."


Page 83: 01Review Renamed to P1Review
-------------------------------------

Page 83, Section "Open and Edit an Existing Document," Step 1:
Change: "01Review"
To: "P1Review"


Graphic Should Show All Pages in Portrait Layout
------------------------------------------------

Page 103, Screen Capture:
The screen capture on page 103 should show all 4 pages in Portrait layout.
The second two pages are not changed to Landscape layout until the steps on page
104 are completed.


Page Numbering Steps Incomplete
-------------------------------

The following two clarifications should be made to page 107 and page 108:

After performing the first set of steps on page 108, the page numbers might
appear in the top right corner of each page instead of the bottom left corner of
each page. This will happen if the "View header and footer information" step on
page 107 was done before doing the steps on page 108.

Correction:
Page 107: Change solid triangle to a bold number 1 (below the "View header and
footer information" heading).

Page 107: Add the following step 2 between the Tip and the "Creating Simple
Alternating Footers" section heading:

  Click the Close button on the Header and footer toolbar.

On page 108, the steps to create an alternating footer could be further clarified
to ensure the first page omits the page number. The remaining document should be
formatted with alternating footers.

Correction:
Add the following steps under "Create an alternating footer" after step 3:

1. Make sure that the Different first page check box is checked.

2. Click the Apply To down arrow, and then choose Whole Document from the list.


Not All Page Numbers Are Removed
--------------------------------

The steps on pages 108-109 under the heading "Remove the existing page numbers"
ask you to remove the existing page numbers from your document. However, these
steps do not remove all of the page numbers on the odd- numbered pages.

Earlier on page 108, the text asks you to create an alternating footer. With an
alternating footer in place, the page numbers must be deleted manually from both
odd and even-numbered pages.

Workaround
----------

On pages 108 &amp; 109, perform the steps in the section titled "Remove the
alternating footer option" before performing the steps in the section titled
"Remove the existing page numbers."


Missing Step to Enter Text in Header
------------------------------------

Step 5 at the top of page 109 asks you to close the Header and Footer toolbar.
However, Step 1 under Enter text in the header assumes that the Header and
Footer toolbar is present.

Correction:
Insert the following step before step 1 under Enter text in the header (and
renumber the steps accordingly):

1. On the View menu, click Header and Footer.
