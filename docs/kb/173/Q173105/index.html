SYMPTOMS
========


If you receive a message when connected to a Microsoft Mail postoffice, save it
in a .Pst file, use that .Pst file in a profile that connects to Microsoft
Exchange Server, and attempt to move or copy that message to your Exchange
Server mailbox, you may receive the following error message:

  An item could not be copied. The action could not be completed.

On a computer running Microsoft Outlook97 or Outlook98, the error message is as
follows:

  Some items could not be copied. They were either moved, deleted or access was
  denied.

You will receive this error message any time that you save a Simple Mail Transfer
Protocol (SMTP) message in a .Pst file using the Exchange client with only the
Microsoft Mail services installed and later try to move the message to an
Exchange Server with only the Exchange Server service in your profile.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can avoid this problem by adding the Microsoft Mail service to your current
Exchange profile; therefore, if you are connecting only to an Exchange server in
your current profile, you must add the Microsoft Mail service. After you add the
Microsoft Mail service, you will then be able to move all of your messages from
the .Pst file to the Exchange server-based store.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange versions 4.0,
5.0, and 5.5. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You may see this error if you are using the Microsoft Exchange client with the
Microsoft Mail service to connect to a Microsoft Mail postoffice, and you
receive SMTP messages from your Microsoft Mail postoffice mailbox and store the
messages in your .Pst file. If you receive mail in this manner and you are now
working with the above .Pst file and only have a Microsoft Exchange Server
service included in your profile, you can get the above error when trying to
move or copy an SMTP message from your local .Pst file to the Exchange Server
store.

For more information about creating a profile or adding a service to a profile,
see the Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q162203, OL97: User Profiles and
Information Services.
