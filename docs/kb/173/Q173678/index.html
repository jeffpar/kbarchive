-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you undo the dragging of an AutoShape or Text Box object from one document
to another (shown as Move Object in the list of actions you can undo), you can
receive unexpected results.

Case 1: Dragging an AutoShape
-----------------------------

When you click Undo, the AutoShape reappears in the original document but does
not disappear from the second document.

Case 2: Dragging a Text Box
---------------------------

When you click Undo, the Text Box disappears from the second document but does
not reappear in the original document.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, click Undo in both documents. To do this, follow
these steps.

1. Immediately after dragging the object, click the Undo button on the Standard
  toolbar.

2. Click the mouse pointer in the other document to make that document active.

3. Click the Undo button on the Standard toolbar.

The object reappears in the original document and disappears from the second
document.

RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent this problem from occurring, drag the paragraph that the object is
anchored to instead of just dragging the object. To do this, follow these
steps.

NOTE: If you need to show both documents, click Arrange All on the Window menu.

1. Select the text (including the paragraph mark) of the paragraph that contains
  the object's anchor.

  NOTE: Make sure there are at least two paragraphs in the document, and that
  you select the correct paragraph mark. To show paragraph marks, press the
  Show/Hide button on the Standard toolbar.

2. Drag the text to the second document. Both the text and AutoShape object are
  moved.

The Undo button now makes the object reappear in the original document and
disappear from the second document.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Word 97 for Windows.
