-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 4.0, 4.1 
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 4.2

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to start an application that contains a modal dialog function, such
as CDialog::DoModal, AfxMessageBox, or MessageBox, that is called from the
CWinApp derived class' InitInstance function by double-clicking on the
application from the Windows 95 Explorer, selecting the saved document from the
Start Menu or double-clicking on it from File Manager, one of the following may
happen:

- It may work fine if built with Visual C 2.x running under Windows NT 3.5x and
  later.

-or-

- The dialog or message box may come up, but the application's main window may
  not come up, and the process is now hung, and can only be terminated by
  PVIEW.

-or-

- The following error message box may be displayed:

  Cannot find the file &lt;path\filename&gt; (or one of its components). Make
  sure the path and filename are correct and that all required libraries are
  available.

  And, symptom number 2 may also occur.

CAUSE
=====

When you launch an application in File Manager or Windows Explorer, a
WM_DDE_INITIATE is supposed to be handled by the CWinApp and CFrameWnd
OnDDEIntitiate handlers. A call to CDialog::DoModal, AfxMessageBox, or
MessageBox interferes with the ability for the MFC framework to handle these
messages correctly.

RESOLUTION
==========

It has been determined that this behavior is by design and that it is not
recommended to place any of these calls within the CWinApp::InitInstance. Any
password dialogs or dialog based components which need to be displayed in the
InitInstance should be of the modeless type. This does not apply to a dialog
based application or an SDI application.

STATUS
======

This problem was corrected in Visual C++ version 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create an AppWizard Multiple Document Application, specifying a file
  extension to associate with the application.

2. Call a modal dialog function such as CDialog::DoModal, AfxMessageBox, or
  MessageBox from the CWinApp derived class' InitInstance function.

3. Run the application, dismiss the dialog or message box, and save the
  document.

4. Start the application by:

  1. Double-clicking the application from the Windows 95 Explorer.

  -or-

  2. Selecting the saved document from the Start Menu

  -or-

  3. Double-clicking the application from File Manager.
