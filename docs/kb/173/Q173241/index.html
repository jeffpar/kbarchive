Product(s): Windows for Workgroups and Windows NT Networking Issues
Version(s): 3.11b
Operating System(s):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft TCP/IP-32 for Windows for Workgroups, version 3.11b 
- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 users with Microsoft TCP/IP installed and
running may be susceptible to very specific "out-of-band" data packets that are
deliberately sent to the server during a TCP/IP session. When they are received,
these packets may cause the Windows for Workgroups 3.11-based computer to stop
responding (hang).

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if certain very specific "out-of-band" data packets are
deliberately sent to the server during a TCP/IP session.


RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows for Workgroups
3.11 running Microsoft TCP/IP 32b.

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
