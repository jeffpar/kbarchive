The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5

SUMMARY
=======

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry. Before
you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if a problem
occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring the Registry"
Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key" Help topic in
Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

After you remove the Log on Locally right for a user on a computer running
Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS), the user may still be able to log
on to his or her Microsoft Exchange Server mailbox via Microsoft Outlook Web
Access. This behavior is temporary and depends on the length of time that user
tokens are cached on the server.

CAUSE
=====

For performance reasons, user tokens are cached by IIS and updated at 15- minute
intervals. The first time a user logs on via a Web browser, the user's user
token is created. If the Log on Locally right is subsequently revoked, the user
can still access the mailbox for approximately 15 minutes.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

- Restart all the IIS services (Gopher, FTP, and WWW). This will refresh the
  token cache on the IIS computer. For performance reasons, this is the
  preferred method if updates are infrequent.

-or-

- Change the default interval for the token cache by editing the Microsoft
  Windows NT registry.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:

     SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\InetInfo\Parameters

3. Select Edit.

4. Click Add Value, and add the following:

  " Value Name: UserTokenTTL
  Data Type: REG_DWORD
  Data: (Number of seconds for token to be cached - 30 second min) " (without
  the quotation marks)

5. Stop and restart all three IIS services (WWW, FTP, and Gopher).

For information about changing the UserTokenTTL value, refer to the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152526 Changing the Default Interval for User Tokens in IIS
