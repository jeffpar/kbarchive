-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

After establishing a remote control session with a Windows 95 client using NetBT
(NetBIOS encapsulated in TCP/IP), the remote control session may terminate
unexpectedly when an application is opened or closed.

After the remote control session terminates, the Windows 95 client may lock up
and receive a general protection (GP) fault. If the client stops responding
(locks up), it may be necessary to turn off the system to restore
functionality.

Applications known to cause this problem:

- Microsoft Exchange Client version 4.0

- Microsoft ActiveMovie 3.0 (add-on for Microsoft Internet Explorer)

- Other custom applications that display embedded AVI animation as a normal
  part of the application's execution

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by an abnormal reset of the NetBIOS session by the
NetBIOS interface on the Windows 95 client.


WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid the problem, you can perform remote control over IP sockets instead of
NetBT. This will allow the remote control session to function normally.

To test IP sockets with a single Windows 95 client, do the following:

1. Ensure that the Remote Control Agent is not running.

2. Open the Sms.ini file located in the root of drive C.

3. Change the Default Protocol statement located in the [Sight] section from
  "NetBIOS" to "IP".

4. Save the Sms.ini file and start the Remote Control Agent.

A remote control session with this client will now occur over IP sockets.

NOTE: If the client in the preceding section runs the Systems Management Server
logon script (Smsls.bat) or the Runsms.bat file, the setting in the Sms.ini file
will revert to NetBIOS.

To make all clients in this domain use IP sockets (except for Windows NT, they do
this by default), you must make a registry change at the site server.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To make the registry change, use the following steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Go to the following key in the registry:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Sites\&lt;Sitecode&gt;
\Domains\&lt;Domain&gt;

3. Set the "Default RC Protocol" (REG_SZ) value to "IP".

This forces all Windows 3.1, Windows for Workgroups, and Windows 95 clients that
appear in this domain, to use IP sockets as the default remote control protocol.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
