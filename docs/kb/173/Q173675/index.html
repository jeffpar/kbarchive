-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows, used with:
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Word may appear to stop responding when you open either the File Print
dialog box or the File Page Setup dialog box.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur when all of the following conditions are true:

- You are running Word 97 on a computer running Windows NT Workstation.

  -and-

- The default printer is using a printer driver on a print server computer
  running Windows NT Server.

  -and-

- The network connection to the print server is lost.

Word 97 is trying to access the printer driver on the print server. Windows NT is
continuously trying to access the server and takes a long time to send an error
message back to Word.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you wait long enough, Word receives the error message from Windows NT, and
then Word continues to run properly (with the exception of printing).

To prevent this problem from occurring, select another printer that does not use
the lost connection as the default printer, until you reestablish the
connection.

In some cases the printer with the lost connection does not have to be the
default printer to cause a delay when opening the File Print dialog box. In this
case, you need to delete the printer, modify, or reestablish the connection.

To Delete a Printer
-------------------

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Right-click the icon of the printer that you want to delete.

3. Click Delete on the shortcut menu, and click Yes when you are asked whether
  you want to delete the printer.

To Modify a Printer Connection
------------------------------

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Right-click the icon of the printer whose connection you want to modify.

3. Click Properties on the shortcut menu, and then click the Details tab.

4. In the "Print to the following port" list, click to select a valid printer
  path.

5. Click OK.

To Install a New Printer
------------------------

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

2. Double-click the Add Printer icon, and then click Next.

3. Click Local Printer or Network Printer as appropriate, and then click Next.

  NOTE: If you click Network Printer, you are prompted for the network path for
  the printer. If you do not know the correct path, click Browse, or check with
  your network administrator.

4. Click either Yes or No in the "Do you print from MS-DOS-based programs?"
  area, and then click Next.

5. Click the appropriate manufacturer and model for your printer, and then click
  Next.

6. If you choose to install a local printer, click the correct port and then
  click Next.

7. Type a name for the printer (or accept the default name), and then click
  either Yes or No in the "Do you want your Windows-based programs to use this
  printer as the default printer?" area. Click Next.

8. To print a test page, click Yes.

9. Click Finish.
