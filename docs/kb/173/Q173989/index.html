-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Under certain conditions, an access violation (AV) may occur when Program Group
Control (PGC) first runs after you log on to the network. Under Windows 95, this
problem manifests itself as an AV in Kernel32.dll. Windows 16-bit and Windows NT
platforms can also be affected.

CAUSE
=====

As PGC starts, it enumerates the user groups to which the user belongs (global
groups for Windows NT domains, or user groups for NetWare domains), for the
user's current logon domain, and for each server listed in the user's Sms.ini
file.

If the user is a member of a substantial number of user groups and also has two
or more logon server entries listed in the Sms.ini file, this problem may become
evident during every logon attempt.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression- tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
