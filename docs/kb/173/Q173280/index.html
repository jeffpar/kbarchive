SUMMARY
=======

Tracking logs are created when message tracking is enabled on a Microsoft
Exchange component. These logs can be read and edited by any text editor. The
logs are tab delimited and can be loaded into spreadsheet programs, such as
Microsoft Excel. You can also write an application to interpret message-tracking
logs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Tracking logs are located in \Exchsrvr\Tracking.log. Each daily log is named by
the date it was created (yyyymmdd.log format). The filename date, like all times
in the tracking log, is in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). The following table
defines the fields in the tracking logs:

Field #           Field Name                  Description
=======           ==========                  ===========

                                         message by Microsoft Exchange
                                         Server. It stays with the message
                                         from its origination to delivery
                                         or transfer from the network.

                                         include a message transfer
                                         system-ID (MTS-ID) that
                                         uniquely identifies the

                                         for each recipient.
