-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The insert object function of a container application may fail if the server
application takes a long time to load. For example, if the autosave feature of
Microsoft Excel is turned on and you attempt to insert an Excel Spreadsheet into
a PowerPoint document, any of the following errors may occur:

  Sorry, the source application is busy and cannot respond immediately. You can
  switch to the other application and try to resolve the problem.

  -or-

  The Server application, source file, or item cannot be found. You should
  reinstall the server application.

  -or-

  The Server Application, source file, or item cannot be found. Make sure the
  Application is properly installed and that it has not been deleted, moved, or
  renamed.

CAUSE
=====

Excel takes more time to load when the Autosave ADDIN is enabled. The load delay
in Excel results in RPC_E_SERVERCALL_RETRYLATER being returned. Windows NT is
not properly handling the retry mechanism for OLE and therefore
RPC_E_CALL_REJECTED is returned. This causes the operation to not succeed.
