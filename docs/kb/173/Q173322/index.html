IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Windows NT-based computer is shut down improperly (for example, by a
power failure), Autochk scans the hard disk the next time you start Windows NT.

This operation may take a long time on large hard disks, which may not be
appropriate in some production environments.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


A hotfix is available to modify Autochk so that you have 30 seconds at startup to
choose not to run Autochk during the present startup. If you cancel Autochk, it
is automatically rescheduled to run the next time you start Windows NT.

WARNING: Autochk runs because it has detected that the computer was not shut down
properly or because it has detected problems with the file system. Preventing
Autochk from running may cause additional file system problems to occur that can
lead to data loss. Microsoft does not recommend disabling Autochk from running
unless you have a full backup of the volume.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To disable the 30 second countdown after installing the hotfix add the following
registry entry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CCS\Control\Session Manager\AutoChkTimeOut

  REG_DWORD: 1

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.
