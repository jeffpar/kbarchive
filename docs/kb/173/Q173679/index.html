SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to connect to MSN, The Microsoft Network, or start Microsoft
Internet Explorer, the MSN Sign In screen may not appear. Your computer attempts
to connect to the Web site and you may receive an error message similar to the
following:

  Internet Explorer cannot open the Internet site http://onstage.msn.com

CAUSE
=====

MSN and Internet Explorer may no longer be associated with Dial-Up Networking.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, re-create the association between MSN and Dial-Up
Networking. To do so, use one of the following methods:

Method 1
--------

1. Double-click My Computer.

2. Double-click Dial-Up Networking.

3. Double-click the The Microsoft Network connection.

4. Type your MSN Member ID in the User Name box. You must include "MSN/" before
  your Member ID when you connect to MSN using Dial-Up Networking. For example,
  type:

  "MSN/&lt;MSN MemberID&gt;" (without the quotation marks)

5. Type your MSN password in the Password box. You must type all letters in the
  password lowercase letters.

6. Click Connect.

7. After you are connected to MSN, double-click the MSN icon on the desktop to
  start Program Viewer. Log off the MSN connection (be sure to click Disconnect
  in the Connected To The Microsoft Network dialog box), and then attempt to
  connect to MSN again using your normal sign in procedure.

If the MSN Sign In screen still does not appear, use the following steps:

1. Right-click the The Internet icon on the desktop, and then click Properties.

2. On the Connection tab, under Dialing, click the "Connect to the Internet as
  needed" check box to select it.

3. In the "Use the following Dial-Up Networking connection" box, click The
  Microsoft Network.

4. Click OK.

5. Attempt to connect to MSN using your normal sign in procedure.

Method 2
--------

1. Double-click the Inbox icon on the desktop.

2. On the Tools menu, point to Deliver Now Using, and then click The Microsoft
  Network.

3. Click Connect.

4. After checking for new messages, Microsoft Exchange closes and then
  disconnects from MSN.

5. Attempt to connect to MSN using your normal sign in procedure.

Method 3
--------

1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

2. In the Named box, type "onlstmt.exe" (without the quotation marks).

3. Click Find Now.

4. Double-click the Onlstmt.exe file in the list of found files.

5. Click Connect.

6. When the Online Statement window opens, click Close.

7. When you are prompted to disconnect from MSN, click No.

8. Double-click the MSN icon on the desktop to start Program Viewer. Log off the
  MSN connection and then attempt to connect to MSN again using your normal
  sign in procedure.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If none of the above methods resolves the issue, Program Viewer or its controls
may be damaged and must be replaced. To do so, use the following steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

3. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click MSN Program Viewer Controls, and then
  click Add/Remove.

4. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click MSN Program Viewer, and then click
  Add/Remove.

5. Restart the computer.

  window appears, close it.

7. Double-click My Computer.

8. Right-click the CD-ROM drive, and then click Explore.
