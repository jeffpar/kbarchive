The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11

SUMMARY
=======

When a Setup error message contains an error code, it also includes some text
indicating what Setup was trying to do, for example, copying a file. The text of
the error message indicates whether the error is fatal or not. In some nonfatal
cases, Setup may be performing an operation (such as copying a file) that is
needed to run Microsoft Windows. Other times the error may prevent some specific
feature of Windows from operating properly.

In many cases, the error code is an MS-DOS extended error code. These error codes
are between 0 and 100. Setup-specific error codes have two different formats,
depending on whether the error occurs during the character (MS- DOS) mode or the
Windows graphical user interface (GUI) mode portion of Setup. The character mode
Setup-specific error numbers are in the format "Snnn", where "nnn" is any
three-digit number. The GUI mode error numbers are codes greater than 200.

MORE INFORMATION
================

GUI Mode Setup Error Codes
--------------------------

208

  Out of disk space during file copy in VerInstallFile. Because of the disk
  space checks that Setup does, this problem should occur only if you have
  upgraded over an invalid Windows installation (that is, files have been
  deleted manually). Make sure there is enough disk space and then run Setup
  again. Also make sure that VER.DLL does not exist in the WINDOWS directory.
  It should only be in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.

209

  File in use. This error occurs if some file that needs to be replaced by
  Setup is in use or opened by another some other software. Make sure Setup is
  the only application running or exit Windows and run Setup from the MS-DOS
  prompt.

210

  Destination file is write-protected. Type

  ATTRIB -r &lt;filename&gt;

  at the MS-DOS prompt, where &lt;filename&gt; is the indicated file and run
  Setup again. This problem may also be caused by virus- protection software,
  in which case, this software should be disabled while running Setup.

211

  Buffers allocated for file expansion operations are too small. This error
  should never occur. If it does, free up some memory and run Setup again.

212

  Unknown version mismatch happened during attempt to install file. This
  problem can be caused by the incorrect version of VER.DLL running or by
  corrupt files. Make sure you do not have VER.DLL in your WINDOWS directory.
  It should only be in the WINDOWS\SYSTEM directory.

213

  File expansion initialization failed. This problem is probably due to
  insufficient memory.

214

  Source file is unreadable. This problem is probably due to drive hardware
  problems, corrupt files or disks, or, if you are setting up from a network,
  network problems. Setup error 214 can also be caused by incorrect CMOS
  settings for floppy drives or third party extended memory managers.
