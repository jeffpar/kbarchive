-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To obtain the enhanced functionality of the dual network support of LAN Manager
2.1 (dual support for LAN Manager 2.1 and NetWare) under Microsoft Windows
operating system version 3.1, you must make some modifications to your Windows
installation.

The following details the settings that must appear in the SYSTEM.INI file, and
the specifics on the proper method to install dual network support with Windows
3.1.

Windows 3.1 does not officially support any dual network driver.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A proper installation of the dual network driver will make the following entries
in your SYSTEM.INI:

     [boot]
     network.drv=dualnet.drv

     [boot description]
     network.drv=LAN Manager/Netware Dual Network

     [386Enh]
     network=*vnetbios,vdualnet.386,vipx.386,vnetware.386,vlanman.386

     [Netware]
     RestoreDrives=False
     NWShareHandles=True

Upgrading to 3.1 with Dual Network Support
------------------------------------------

If LAN Manager 2.1 has previously been installed for NetWare connectivity with
Windows 3.0, and the system is being upgraded to Windows 3.1, the Setup program
will not make any changes to the network drivers. You will need to manually
upgrade your NetWare Windows components. These components are:

  NETWARE.DRV
  VNETWARE.386
  VIPX.386
  NETWARE.HLP
  NWPOPUP.EXE (optional)
  NWPOPUP.HLP (optional)

Additionally, you will need to upgrade your MS-DOS NetWare components. These
components are:

  NETX.COM
  IPX.COM.

You will need to use the Novell WSGEN or SHGEN programs to create an IPX.COM from
the IPX.OBJ supplied with Windows 3.1.

Installing Dual Network Support with 3.1
----------------------------------------

If you already have Windows 3.1 installed and want to install LAN Manager 2.1
with NetWare connectivity (or add the NetWare connectivity to your existing LAN
Manager installation), use the LAN Manager Setup program. This will copy the
proper files and make the correct entries in your SYSTEM.INI file. Make sure
that the WSGEN or SHGEN disk you use to generate a new IPX.COM and copy NETX.COM
contains the updated files (IPX.OBJ and NETX.COM) supplied with Windows 3.1.

Installing 3.1 on a Dual Network System
---------------------------------------

If you already are running LAN Manager 2.1 with NetWare connectivity and want to
install Windows 3.1, Windows will detect that you are running LAN Manager 2.1
and install for that network only. After you have completed installing Windows
with support for LAN Manager 2.1, you will need to run the NetWare connectivity
Setup again from your LAN Manager installation to upgrade your NetWare
components and make the necessary modifications to your SYSTEM.INI file (see
section above for more information).
