-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Under Microsoft Windows, increasing free disk space provides additional storage
space for files and additional capacity for running applications.

The following files can be deleted to free disk space:

- Delete any ~xxxxxxx.TMP files that remain in the \TEMP directory when Windows
  is not running.

- Delete any files that start with the characters ~WOA.

- Delete the file WIN386.SWP from the \WINDOWS directory if it remains when
  Windows is not running.

- Delete the permanent swap file.

- Delete optional files from the Windows directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following text provides more detailed information.

- When Windows is not running, delete any ~xxxxxxx.TMP files that remain in the
  \TEMP directory.

  This directory is defined as an environment variable in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
  file. To identify the \TEMP directory location, type "SET" (without quotation
  marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt. Windows and applications for Windows use
  the \TEMP directory to save temporary work files to the disk. Untracked files
  hurt the performance of some applications for Windows, particularly when they
  are attempting to print.

- Delete any files that start with the characters ~WOA.

  These files are Windows application swap files. Windows deletes application
  swap files when you exit the associated application. However, these files may
  remain on your hard disk if Windows terminates unexpectedly. You can safely
  delete application swap files if Windows is not currently running.

- Delete the file WIN386.SWP from the Windows directory if it remains when
  Windows is not running.

  WIN386.SWP is the temporary swap file used by Windows in 386 enhanced mode
  when a permanent swap file does not exist. Windows creates WIN386.SWP when
  started and then deletes it upon exiting. If Windows terminates unexpectedly,
  it is possible that Windows will never have the opportunity to delete
  WIN386.SWP. You can recover room on your hard disk by manually removing this
  file from your Windows directory. CAUTION: The WIN386.SWP file should ONLY be
  removed if it exists on your disk when you are NOT running Windows. If you
  delete WIN386.SWP in the middle of a Windows session and Windows is
  attempting to use a temporary swap file, its removal causes your machine to
  hang.

  NOTE: Do NOT delete files named 386SPART.PAR or SPART.PAR. Together these two
  files constitute a permanent swap file, and they should not be manually
  removed.

- Delete the permanent swap file. Do not manually delete this file. Instead,
  follow the appropriate procedure listed below.

  Windows 3.0 and 3.0a

  a. Start Windows in real mode (type "win /r" without quotation marks at the
     MS-DOS command prompt).

  b. In Program Manager, choose Run from the File menu.

  c. In the Command Line box, type "swapfile" (without quotation marks).

  Windows 3.1 and 3.11

  a. Start Control Panel.

  b. Choose the 386 Enhanced icon.

  c. Choose the Virtual Memory button.

  d. Choose the Change button.

  e. From the Type list, select None.

- Delete optional files from the Windows directory.

  If your system is short on disk space, you may consider deleting some optional
  Windows files to conserve disk space. The following list provides more
  information on files that Windows loads but are not essential to its
  operation:
