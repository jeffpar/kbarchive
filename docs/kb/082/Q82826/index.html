- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11

SUMMARY
=======

When using Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 with OLE version 1.0,
it is possible to share an object (create a link to a piece of data) that is
located on a network file server. To do this, both the client application and
the server application must be installed on the same local machine.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To establish an OLE communication, both the server and the client application
must be installed on the same machine. The interprocess communication that OLE
uses (dynamic data exchange -- DDE) is not supported across the network, only
locally. The information, either the container document or the source of the
linked object, can be on the network server.

In the case of a linked object, the network address for the file that contains
the object is stored with the object. When the object is activated, OLE tries to
bind to the object. If the network file server is not connected, OLE will
attempt to make the connection. If the file server has a password, then OLE will
ask for the password. If the connection cannot be established, or if the file is
not found, an error message is displayed:

  Linked document is unavailable.

There is no known limit to the number of connections or links to a network file
server, except available drive letters.
