The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If a second instance of Microsoft Windows 3.0 is started from another
application (including an MS-DOS virtual session, the MS-DOS Shell, or certain
Windows applications), one of the following error messages may be displayed:

  Cannot run second instance of Windows, exit this instance of Windows and run
  from the original version of Windows.

  -or-

  Cannot run a non-Windows application from the second instance of Windows;
  exit this instance of Windows and run your application from the original
  instance.

  -or-

  Insufficient memory to run application; close one or more applications to
  increase available memory and try again.

Microsoft recommends that you do not start Windows from within a shell utility or
from menu program.

NOTE: The information in this article applies to Windows 3.0 and 3.0a; it does
not apply to later versions of Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Second Instance of Windows Started from MS-DOS Prompt
-----------------------------------------------------

A second (or additional) instance of Windows is created if you issue the WIN
command from an application running within Windows, including the MS-DOS prompt
and MS-DOS batch files. If this happens, the following error may be displayed:

  Cannot run second instance of Windows, exit this instance of Windows and run
  from the original version of Windows.

For example, if you start an MS-DOS session from the MS-DOS Prompt within
Windows,you have access to all MS-DOS commands and statements. If you then type
"WIN" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER, a second instance of
Windows is started and the error message is displayed.

To end your MS-DOS session and return to Windows, type "EXIT" (without quotation
marks) and then press ENTER. To return to Windows without ending your MS-DOS
session, press ALT+TAB.

Second Instance of Windows Started from MS-DOS Shell
----------------------------------------------------

Although it is not recommended, you can run Windows from the MS-DOS Shell.
However, if you attempt to execute an MS-DOS application within Windows and you
have the MS-DOS Task Swapper option enabled, the following error message may be
displayed:

  Cannot run a non-Windows application from the second instance of Windows;
  exit this instance of Windows and run your application from the original.

In the MS-DOS Shell, the Enable Task Swapper option should be displayed (that is,
it should not have a check mark beside Enable Task Swapper on the Option menu).
This option is a toggled selection: choosing Enable Task Swapper the first time
enables it; choosing it again disables it.

The following error may be displayed if you try to run Windows in 386 enhanced
mode from within the MS-DOS Shell (regardless of the Enable Task Swapper option
status):

  Insufficient memory to run application; close one or more applications to
  increase available memory and try again.

At this point, exit Windows, exit MS-DOS Shell, and start Windows from the MS-DOS
command prompt.

Second Instance of Windows Started from an Application
------------------------------------------------------

Starting a Windows application such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Project, or
Microsoft PowerPoint from an MS-DOS batch file inside Windows starts another
instance of Windows.

Large Windows applications such as these start an instance of Windows when the
application's executable filename is invoked. Smaller Windows applications, such
as Notepad, do not start another instance of Windows.

For example, if you type "EXCEL" (without the quotation marks) at an MS-DOS
command prompt, Microsoft Excel starts as does a new instance of Windows. If you
type "NOTEPAD" (without the quotation marks) at an MS-DOS command prompt,
Notepad does not start unless you type WIN before the command (that is, WIN
NOTEPAD ).
