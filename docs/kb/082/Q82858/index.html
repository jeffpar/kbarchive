SUMMARY
=======

Norton Desktop for Windows (NDW) versions 1.x and 2.0 create two sets of backup
files to store the configuration of both the MS-DOS environment and the
Microsoft Windows environment.

The first set of files have the .ND0 file extension. These files are the original
configuration files that were used by both MS-DOS and Windows prior to the
original installation of Norton Desktop for Windows.

For Norton Desktop for Windows 1.0, you have the following files:

  AUTOEXEC.ND0
  CONFIG.ND0
  WIN.ND0
  SYSTEM.ND0

For Norton Desktop for Windows 2.0, you have the following files:

  CONFIG.NDW
  AUTOEXEC.NDW
  WIN.NDW
  SYSTEM.NDW

The second set of files have the .NDW file extension. The .NDW files are the
configuration files prior to the most recent installation of Norton Desktop for
Windows. These files are replaced with subsequent installation of Norton Desktop
for Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To return Windows and MS-DOS to the state they were in before Norton Desktop for
Windows was installed, copy the *.ND0 files to the original system files with
the appropriate extension. For example, to restore the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, type
the following at the MS-DOS command prompt:

  copy autoexec.nd0 autoexec.bat

You will be left with a number of extraneous files in the various directories;
however, Windows will run as it originally did.

For more information of removing all Norton Desktop for Windows files, query on
the following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
