SUMMARY
=======

After starting the Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1 on a machine
with less than 4 megabytes (MB) of available RAM or loading several Windows
applications in the Startup group, Windows accesses the hard drive for a few
seconds.

Windows is doing two things to make your applications run faster:

- All segments from the boot-time modules (Kernel, User, GDI, the display
  driver, and so on) are loaded into memory if there is enough free physical
  memory to hold the segments. This speeds up the loading of applications that
  require these segments.

- All unlocked virtual memory is written to the paging swap file. This allows
  Windows to quickly discard memory because the contents have already been
  written to the paging swap file.

Note: This disk activity does not prevent you from doing other tasks. All of
these operations are done during "idle" system time. Applications respond
normally while this disk activity is in progress.

This behavior does not change if you enable or disable 32-bit disk access.
