the icon twice before you can begin the task.

If you have difficulty getting Desktop to run, you might need to make the
following changes to the [386Enh] section of your SYSTEM.INI file: Add the line
device=*vdmad and remove the line:

       device=vdmadx.386.

States, contact your local software vendor.

WordPerfect for Windows
-----------------------

If you have been running WordPerfect version 5.1 with Windows version 3.0 and you
find that it runs differently with Windows version 3.1, you need to obtain an
updated version of Wordperfect.

WordStar for Windows
--------------------

If you have been running WordStar for Windows with Windows version 3.0, you might
see some differences when you run this application with Windows version 3.1. For
example, some elements of the WordStar screen might not be displayed the same as
they were in Windows version 3.0.

Windows version 3.1 uses descriptive printer-model names for printer drivers.
Because WordStar does not recognize the new names, you need to update your
WordStar templates. Do this by opening a template, selecting the printer you are
using, and then saving the new information in the template.

To obtain an updated version of WordStar for Windows, contact your software
vendor or call Wordstar International, Incorporated, at 1-800-227-5609. Outside
the United States, contact your local software vendor or WordStar subsidiary.

we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
