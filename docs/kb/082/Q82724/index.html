- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11

SUMMARY
=======

With Microsoft Windows operating system version 3.1, the Setup program can be
used to change the configuration of the network after Windows has been
installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are several limitations in the Windows version of maintenance mode Setup.
In general, Setup should be run from the command prompt outside of Windows when
modifying the network configuration.

Although Setup can add entries to the LOAD= line in the WIN.INI file, it cannot
remove them. Therefore, when changing from a network that puts a utility on the
LOAD= line in the WIN.INI file to a network that provides different network
utilities, the first utility installed will continue loading, probably causing
an error message. An example is NWPOPUP.EXE in Novell NetWare.

When changing networks, you should remove network utilities from the LOAD= line
in the WIN.INI file.

Some networks have Windows components that do not ship with Windows. If these
components are found in the network directory during Setup, Setup will configure
Windows to use them; otherwise, Setup will use a default installation and notify
you of the missing software.

Because the descriptions for these network versions are the same, Setup will not
automatically reconfigure Windows to use the components if they are later copied
to the machine. To correctly reconfigure Windows to use the added network
components, you must run maintenance mode Setup twice; once to set the network
to "No Network Installed," and once to set it back to the original network
version. Note that maintenance mode Setup does not perform detection. You must
know which network entry to select.
