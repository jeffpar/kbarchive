SUMMARY
=======

Under Microsoft Windows, there may be a long pause while bringing up the dialog
box or double-clicking the drive icon of CD-ROM drives, due to the way the
common dialogs (for example, OpenFile, SaveFile) test for drive types.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Depending on the CD-ROM driver, there may be a long pause when the dialog box
first appears. This is due to the driver reading the disk for drive type
information (which it shouldn't need to do, but some do). If you experience
this, another driver that works with your CD drive may correct the problem.

If the drive is audio only (no data) and you select it in the Drives list box,
there will be a long pause as the driver looks through the entire CD for data
information.

Note that these problems seem to only happen when you have an audio-only disk in
the drive. If there is a data disk (or one that has both data and audio), these
problems should not occur.
