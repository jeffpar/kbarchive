-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Recipient addresses on messages sent through an EDK (Exchange Development Kit)
gateway are corrupted. As a result, the message cannot be delivered to the
recipient. This occurs if the address is in the form:

  FAX:username@(xxx)xxxxxxx

where (xxx)xxxxxxx is a phone number with an area code in parentheses that starts
with a 0, 1, or 2. Also, where FAX is the address type defined by the EDK
gateway. The recipient name is corrupted to:

  FAX:username@E9368080

The corruption, in this case the letter E, is different depending on the areacode
provided.

CAUSE
=====

The use of parentheses in the address triggers the corruption. Parentheses are
used in an X.400 address to portray characters such as the at sign (@), the
exclamation mark (!), or the percent sign (%) in an address. The area code of
this fax address is incorrectly interpreted as a non-printable string of
characters. This occurs for any three digits enclosed in parentheses, where the
first digit is a 0, 1, or 2.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Exchange Server version 5.5.
This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Exchange Server uses RFC 987 to interpret parentheses in an address. RFC 987
provides a method of mapping non-printable characters to printable ones for a
legal X.400 address. Most X.400 address attributes have to be printable
characters as defined in Table 4 of Recommendation X.409. For example, RFC 987
specifies the following:

  Non-Printable Characters      X.400 Printable Characters
  @                            (a)
  %                            (p)
  !                            (b)
  "                            (q)
  _                            (u)
  3digits                       3digits

Exchange Server implements RFC 987 in Escprint.dll. The fixed files for this
issue add implementation for a more recent RFC that obsoletes RFC. The current
RFC is RFC 2156.
