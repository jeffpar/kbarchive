SYMPTOMS
========

If you have multiple hardware profiles configured, an option labeled "None of
the Above" is included in the list of hardware profiles when you start your
computer. If you select "None of the Above," Plug and Play enumeration occurs,
and some devices may be reset to configurations that the drivers configured in
the hardware profiles cannot support. When this occurs, you may have to manually
reload the original device drivers.

RESOLUTION
==========

This issue is resolved by the following updated file:

Windows 95 version 4.00.950 (retail release) and 4.00.950 A (Service Pack 1):

  Io.sys dated 12/22/97 5:53pm   223,230 bytes

Windows 95 version 4.00.950 B (OEM Service Release 2 and 2.1) and 4.00.950 C (OEM
Service Release 2.5):

  Io.sys dated 12/22/97 6:10pm   214,918 bytes

  Io.sys dated 05/21/99  05:13p    222,456 bytes

Edition that fixes the problem described in this article:

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

This update replaces the hidden system file named Io.sys in the root folder of
the boot drive and allows you to remove the "None of the Above" option from the
list of hardware profiles presented when you start your computer. The update
adds the following registry key:

Key:        HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\control\IDConfigDB
Value:      HideNoneOfAbove
Type:       Binary
Data Value: 01 00 00 00

To hide the "None of the Above" option, set the value as shown above. To display
the "None of the Above" option, remove the value or set it to "00 00 00 00."

The update described in this article is available for Windows 98 and Windows 98
Second Edition, as described in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:
