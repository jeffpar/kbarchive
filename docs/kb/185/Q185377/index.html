-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Users cannot open an FTP or Web site.

NOTE: A sampling of specific error messages you may receive is listed in the
"MORE INFORMATION" section of this article.

CAUSE
=====

User rights in the Windows NT User Manager or the Internet Service Manager (ISM)
are not set up properly.

WORKAROUND
==========

The information in this "Workaround" section about troubleshooting User Rights,
Anonymous Authentication, and Basic Authentication was taken from the Windows NT
Option Pack online Product Documentation.

NOTE: To view this entire topic, open the following in the product
documentation's table of contents:

- Microsoft Internet Information Server

- IIS Installation

- Troubleshooting

User Rights
-----------

If a user is having trouble viewing your published files (that is, he or she is
receiving HTTP "403; Forbidden" or similar HTTP errors when attempting to
request a Web page), then there is most likely a problem related to the user
rights that are configured on your Web site. In order to give users access to
your published files, check the following items.

1. Find the specific file, directory, or virtual directory which the user cannot
  access in Internet Service Manager.

2. View the properties for that file, directory, or virtual directory.

3. Select the File property sheet (if viewing properties of a file) or Directory
  property sheet (if viewing the properties of a directory or virtual
  directory). Ensure that the directory or file has Read access permissions
  (the Read check box should be selected).

4. Select the File Security or Directory Security property sheet.

5. Ensure that the user has either anonymous access, basic authentication
  permissions, or Windows NT Challenge/Response permissions that will allow him
  or her to view the content by clicking the Edit button in the Anonymous
  Access and Authentication Control field.

6. Click the Edit button in the TCP/IP and Domain Name Restrictions field to
  ensure that the client's computer, group of computers, or domain name has not
  been restricted from accessing your resource.

Anonymous Authentication
------------------------

If an anonymous user cannot access your site, check the following.

Ensure that the anonymous user's password is the same in both Internet Service
Manager and User Manager:

1. In ISM, select the Web site, virtual directory, directory, or file on which
  you need to check anonymous access and view its properties.

2. Select the File Security property sheet (if viewing properties of a file) or
  Directory Security property sheet (if viewing properties of a Web site,
  virtual directory, or directory) and click the Edit button in the Anonymous
  Access and Authentication Control field.

3. In the Authentication Methods dialog box, make sure that the Allow Anonymous
  Access check box is selected.

4. Click the Edit button to view the user name and password that are used when
  an anonymous user connects to your site. In order to enable your Web site to
  automatically synchronize your anonymous password settings with those set in
  Windows NT, select the Enable Automatic Password Sychronization check box (it
  is selected by default for all resources that allow anonymous access).

Ensure that the anonymous user has Log on locally rights in Windows NT User
Manager for Domains:

1. Launch User Manager from the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) toolbar.

2. In User Manager, select User Rights in the Policies menu.

3. Choose the right Log On Locally and make sure IUSR_ (or your anonymous
  account) shows up in the list.

If you are having trouble PREVENTING an anonymous user from accessing your site,
please check the following:

1. Select the File Security property sheet (if viewing properties of a file) or
  Directory Security property sheet (if viewing properties of a Web site,
  virtual directory, or directory) and click the Edit button in the Anonymous
  Access and Authentication Control field.

2. In the Authentication Methods dialog box, make sure that the Allow Anonymous
  Access check box is not selected.

Basic Authentication
--------------------

If users with Basic Authentication rights are having trouble accessing your site,
please check the following.

Ensure that the login user has Log on locally rights in Windows NT User Manager
for Domains:

1. Launch User Manager from the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) toolbar.

2. In User Manager, select User Rights in the Policies menu.

3. Choose the right Log On Locally and make sure IUSR_ (or your anonymous
  account) shows up in the list.

Make sure that you specify a Default Logon Domain for the user: in the
Authentication Methods dialog box, click Edit in the Basic Authentication field
and enter the Domain Name.

If you are concerned about the safety of transmitting passwords in clear text (an
industry standard that applies to Basic Authentication), use Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL) to secure clear text passwords. You can configure SSL Client
authentication by launching the Secure Communications dialog box from the
Directory Security (or File Security) property sheet. Use Key Manager to create
Key requests and the Secure Communications dialog box to enable an SSL
Authentication scheme.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Default Anonymous User Account
------------------------------

During installation of IIS, the anonymous user account is set to
IUSR_&lt;computername&gt; by default.

Sampling of Specific Error Messages
-----------------------------------

Netscape Navigator, or the Windows NT FTP utility when a site cannot be opened:

  HTTP "403; Forbidden

  HTTP Error 401
  401.1 Unauthorized: Logon Failed

  This error indicates that the credentials passed to the server do not match
  the credentials required to log on to the server.

  Please contact the Web server's administrator to verify that you have
  permission to access the requested resource.

  Internet Explorer cannot open the Internet site
  ftp://&lt;domain_name&gt;.
