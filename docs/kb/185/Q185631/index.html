-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a computer running Windows NT temporarily looses its physical connectivity
(disconnection and reconnection of cable) to an ATM network, clients cannot
re-establish a NetBIOS session without the server being restarted.

RESOLUTION
==========

There is a new Olicom OC-615x driver, version 3.55 that resolves this problem.
You can verify that the new version of the driver is loaded by running Olicom
Adapter Information for Windows (AIW - this will be renamed to LanScout in the
future) which came with the ATM adapter. Pressing F3 to generate a report.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The problem has been experienced with a computer running Windows NT 4.0
connected to an ATM network using an Olicom OC-615x (OC-6151 &amp; OC-6152) with
driver version 3.54. Olicom has confirmed that this is because of the way the
driver reports the functional address to the NetBIOS stack when re- establishing
the connection. Lower parts of the stack are unaffected, as the server still has
TCP/IP connectivity.

This problem is also experienced in earlier versions of the driver.

of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
