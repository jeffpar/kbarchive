-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
- Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to view the Volume Control tool, some of the devices located on the
right side of Volume Control may be cut off or missing.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the width of Volume Control exceeds the width of the
Windows desktop. This can occur if Volume Control is configured to display more
devices than can fit on the visible portion of the desktop. Note that this
problem is more likely to occur at screen resolutions of 800 by 600 pixels or
less.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use one or more of the following methods:

Method 1
--------

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to Multimedia,
  and then click Volume Control. If Volume Control is not listed, click Start,
  click Run, type "Sndvol32.exe" (without quotation marks) in the Open box, and
  then click OK.

  In Windows 98, click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to
  Entertainment, and then click Volume Control.

2. Press CTRL+S to view Volume Control in a smaller window. If you want to view
  Volume Control in its original window size, press CTRL+S again. Note that
  when you view Volume Control in a smaller window, you may notice the
  following differences:

   - The Status bar is not displayed.

   - The speaker icons are not displayed.

   - The sliders are missing the words Balance and Volume.

   - The Advanced button is not displayed.

   - The light-emitting diode (LED) displays are not displayed.

Method 2
--------

Increase your screen resolution. To do so, use the following steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
  Display.

2. Click the Settings tab, and then move the slider under Screen Area to a
  higher screen resolution.

3. Click OK, and if you are prompted to restart your computer, do so.

Method 3
--------

Configure your computer to use small screen fonts. Using large fonts may reduce
the number of volume controls that can fit on the screen.

To do so, use the following steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then double-click
  Display.

2. Click the Settings tab, click Small Fonts in the Font Size box, and then
  click OK.

  In Windows 98, click the Advanced button on the Settings tab to access the
  Font Size box.

3. When you are prompted to restart your computer, do so.

Method 4
--------

Configure the Volume Control to display fewer mixer listings. To do so, use the
following steps:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to Multimedia,
  and then click Volume Control. If Volume Control is not listed, click Start,
  click Run, type "Sndvol32.exe" (without quotation marks) in the Open box, and
  then click OK.

  In Windows 98, click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to
  Entertainment, and then click Volume Control.

2. On the Options menu, click Properties.

3. In the Show The Following Volume Controls box, click one of the listed volume
  control check boxes to clear it, and then click OK. If the Volume Control is
  not totally visible, repeat steps 2-3 until you can view all of the Volume
  Control. You may want to leave the most commonly used controls such as Volume
  Control(or Speaker), Wave, MIDI, and CD Player enabled for easy access.

4. Close Volume Control.

Method 5
--------

If you are using Windows 98, you may want to enable support for multiple
monitors. With this feature, Volume Control can extend past the edge of the
primary monitor screen without being cut off. For information about how to
enable support for multiple monitors, see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q179602 How to Enable Multiple Display Support Using Windows 98

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Volume Control.
