SUMMARY
=======

This article describes what GroupWise(R) is and how Microsoft Word 97 for
Windows integrates with GroupWise.

MORE INFORMATION
================

GroupWise 5.2 is a cross-platform messaging and groupware product that enables
you to expand beyond normal e-mail capabilities to access and manage calendar,
scheduling, tasks, voice mail, faxes, and other message types from within a
Universal Mailbox.

GroupWise is also a document management system that enables you to control,
organize, access, and share information. Word processing documents,
spreadsheets, presentations, forms, images, e-mail messages, or any type of file
you want to save can be managed through GroupWise.

How GroupWise Document Management Works
---------------------------------------

Contained in GroupWise 5.2 is the document management system (DMS), which is
extended to include all types of information including e-mail, voice mail,
faxes, images, appointments, tasks, and workflows. Document libraries, hosted on
a GroupWise Post Office, contains document properties while the actual documents
are stored in a binary object store in a compressed and encrypted format. The
GroupWise Post Office Agent is responsible for the maintenance of the document
library and binary object store. Check-in, check-out, version control, security,
and so forth, are built into the document library and the Post Office Agent. Any
ODMA- compliant application can use the document management services of
GroupWise 5.2.

How Word 97 Integrates With GroupWise
-------------------------------------

As an Open Document Management (ODMA) compliant application, Word 97 searches in
the Windows Registry during start-up for the following subkey to determine if a
document management system (DMS) is installed.

  \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes\ODMA32

If GroupWise is found as installed in this registry subkey, Word 97 initiates
calls (hooks) into GroupWise using ODMA integration. As a result of this
integration, several default Word functions are either replaced or supplemented
with the GroupWise interface. These functions include the functions that are
triggered by the following commands on the File menu:

- Open

- Close

- Save

- Save As

- Save as HTML

- Versions

During the installation and integration of GroupWise, the following subkey is
written to the Windows registry:

  \HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes\ODMA32\GRPWISE

NOTE: This is the registry subkey that informs ODMA-compliant applications that
GroupWise is installed on the computer. If the subkey is removed from the
Windows Registry, GroupWise ODMA integration with Word 97 will be disabled.
