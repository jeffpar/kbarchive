SYMPTOMS
========

When a REPORT FORM &lt;report name&gt; TO PRINTER command is issued and a grid
object has focus, incorrect data may be printed in the detail band of the
report.

CAUSE
=====

When the REPORT FORM command is issued from either a toolbar or a menu, while a
grid object has focus, the grid regains focus before the print job is completed.
When the grid regains focus, the currently selected workspace is set to the
record source associated with the grid.

RESOLUTION
==========

Here are three workarounds:

- Add a command button with print functions to the form containing the grid.

  -or-

- Create another form to accept the focus before printing. Here is a code
  example:

        oxprint=CREATEOBJECT(prtform)
        oxprint.SHOW

        DEFINE CLASS prtform AS FORM
           TOP = 50
           LEFT = 50
           HEIGHT = 2
           WIDTH = 2
           DOCREATE = .T.
           CAPTION = ""
           NAME = "Form2"

           PROCEDURE ACTIVATE
              * Insert REPORT FORM and any associated commands here.
              RELEASE THISFORM
           ENDPROC

        ENDDEFINE

  -or-

- Create a user-defined function (UDF) that sets the workarea and reference the
  UDF in the report. A code example is shown below:

        PROCEDURE SETWORKAREA
        IF USED('mytable')
           SELECT mytable
        ENDIF
        retval=ALIAS()
        RETURN retval

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because the current workspace is effectively being reset to the grid's record
source, the report is run using the record source associated with the grid. This
behavior occurs even if the desired table or cursor is specified in the report's
DataEnvironment.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

WARNING: Running the following code may result in the printing of large reports
spanning several pages.

1. Create a report, named Testgrid.frx, which contains the following fields:

        billings.line_no
        billings.unit_price
        billings.quantity

2. Save a copy of Testgrid.frx as Testwork.frx and add a field with the
  following expression:

        SETWORKAREA()

3. Create a program file named PRNDEMO, using the following code:

        CLOSE ALL
        OPEN DATABASE home()+"samples\data\testdata"
        USE orders IN 0
        ocusttool=CREATEOBJECT('toolbars')
        ocusttool.SHOW
        ocustomer=CREATEOBJECT('customer')
        ocustomer.SHOW
        READ EVENTS

        PROCEDURE sqlqry
        cporder=orders.order_id
        SELECT orditems.line_no, orditems.unit_price, ;
           orditems.quantity ;
           FROM orditems ;
           WHERE orditems.order_id=cporder ;
           ORDER BY orditems.line_no ;
           INTO CURSOR billings

        PROCEDURE prnform
        PARAMETER prnout
           DO sqlqry IN PRNDEMO
        DO CASE
           CASE prnout="PREVIEW"
              REPORT FORM testgrid PREVIEW
           CASE prnout="WORKAROUND1" ;
                 OR prnout="WORKAROUND2"
              REPORT FORM testgrid NOCONSOLE TO PRINT
           CASE prnout="WORKAROUND3"
              REPORT FORM testwork NOCONSOLE TO PRINT
           OTHERWISE
              REPORT FORM testgrid NOCONSOLE TO PRINT

4. Create a program file named SETWORKAREA, using the following code:

        IF USED('billing')
           SELECT billing
        ENDIF
        retval=ALIAS()
        RETURN retval

5. In the Command window type:

        DO PRNDEMO

6. Clicking either the form or the "Failing Print" captioned toolbar button
  prints a report with incorrect data in the detail band. The number of records
  printed will be equal to the number of records contained in the orders table.

7. Clicking the command buttons captioned "Preview", "Work Around 1", "Work
  Around 2", or "Work Around 3" prints a report containing the correct data.
