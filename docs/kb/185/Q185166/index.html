SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Visual Basic for Applications EnableCancelKey Property with the
wdCancelDisabled constant to prevent CTRL+BREAK from interrupting a macro,
CTRL+BREAK continues to be disabled after the macro has finished executing. This
behavior is different from the behavior described in the EnableCancelKey
Property Help topic, which states the following:

  The EnableCancelKey property is reset to wdCancelInterrupt when your code
  stops running.

  NOTE: The wdCancelInterrupt constant resets the EnableCancelKey Property to
  allow a macro to be interrupted by CTRL+BREAK.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, make sure the EnableCancelKey Property is reset to
wdCancelInterrupt at any point before macro termination occurs.

The following example Visual Basic for Applications macro sets an error trap to
trap an error that may occur. Note that the EnableCancelKey Property is reset to
wdCancelInterrupt at the point where the macro is terminated.

       Sub IsLastTableRow()

        ' Disable CTRL+BREAK.
        Application.EnableCancelKey = wdCancelDisabled

        ' Set error trap.
        On Error GoTo ErrorHandler

        ' Check if insertion point is in last row of a table.
        ' If the insertion point is within a vertically merged
        ' cell, an error will occur.
        MsgBox Selection.Rows(1).IsLast

     ErrorHandler:
       
        If Err.Number &lt;&gt; 0 Then
           MsgBox Err.Description
        End If
        
        ' Re-enable CTRL+BREAK.
        Application.EnableCancelKey = wdCancelInterrupt
        
     End Sub

For more information about the EnableCancelKey property, in the Visual Basic
Editor, click the Office Assistant, type "EnableCancelKey" (without the
quotation marks), click Search, and then click to view "EnableCancelKey
Property."
