The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Word Conversion Wizard to convert files, you have the
option to "always perform batch conversions." If you select this option, the
next time you run the wizard, you cannot choose "Edit converter or filter
options."

RESOLUTION
==========

To reset "Always perform batch conversions" such that the initial dialog box is
displayed when you run the Conversion Wizard, the Windows 95 registry Conversion
Wizard entry for the Wizard option of AlwaysBatch must be set equal to No
instead of Yes.

To reset this value, you can use one of the following methods:

Method 1: Use a Macro to Reset the Value
----------------------------------------

You can use the following example Visual Basic for Applications macro to reset
the registry value.

     Sub ResetAlwaysBatch()
        Dim strKey As String
        strKey = "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office"
        strKey = strKey &amp; "\8.0\Word\Wizards\Conversion Wizard"
        System.PrivateProfileString("", strKey, "AlwaysBatch") = "No"
     End Sub

Method 2: Edit the Registry Manually to Reset the Value
-------------------------------------------------------

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it. If
you are running Windows NT, you should also update your Emergency Repair Disk
(ERD).

To modify this setting, follow these steps to make changes in the registry
itself:

1. On the Windows 95 Start menu, click Run.

2. In the Open text box, type "Regedit" (without the quotation marks) and click
  OK.

3. Navigate to the following key:

     HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word\Wizards
        \Conversion Wizard

4. On the right side of the Registry Editor dialog box, right-click AlwaysBatch
  and select Modify.

5. In the Value Data box, type "No" (without the quotation marks).

6. Click OK.

7. Exit Registry Editor.
