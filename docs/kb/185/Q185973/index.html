-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Systems Management Server Inventory Agent for Windows NT Server (Invwin32),
runs as a service. The service was written to activate every 24 hours to take
the client's inventory. In some cases, Invwin32.exe (running as service) will
run an inventory continuously, and consume between 80 and 100 percent of a
computer's CPU time.

The following entries are recorded in the Invagent.log file:

     Invwin32.exe running as service.
     Attempting to locate/identify Apple zone.
     Locating/reading SMS.INI.
     Creating output file.
     Locating client MIF directories.

After the last line, the Systems Management Server Inventory service appears to
stop responding and consumes 80 to 100 percent of the processor time until you
stop the Inventory Agent service.

If you run Invwin32 as an executable file (using the /E /V /F switches) the
problem will not occur, and the inventory is performed correctly.

CAUSE
=====

The problem is caused by a corrupted Cmndhis.nt file.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do any of the following:

- Remove the Cmndhis.nt file from the Ms\Sms\Data directory of the affected
  clients.

  -or-

- Wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack.

  -or-

- Contact Microsoft Technical Support to obtain the fix discussed below.
