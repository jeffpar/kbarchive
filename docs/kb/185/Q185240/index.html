SUMMARY
=======

An Excel sheet that is embedded in the General field of a FoxPro table, which is
linked to another Excel sheet, is not automatically updated when the linked
sheet is modified.

To update the embedded sheet, it has to be displayed and edited using Excel by
double clicking the sheet. This article shows a way of doing this
programmatically.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Following are steps to update an embedded Excel sheet programmatically:

1. Create an Excel workbook. On the first sheet, enter text or numbers in some
  of the cells, and save the file as XSheet1.xls. Do not close this sheet.

2. Create another Excel workBook, enter text or numbers in some of the cells,
  and save it as XSheet2.xls.

3. Create a Link from XSheet1 so that some of its cells are linked to cells in
  XSheet2. One way to do this would be to copy using CTRL+C, one of the cells
  in XSheet2 to the clipboard. Then, from the Edit menu, select Paste Special
  and then select Paste Link to copy the cell into XSheet1.

4. Save both Excel files and close the first workbook (XSheet1.xls). Leave the
  second workbook (XSheet2.xls) open.

5. Run Visual FoxPro and create a table with a General field.

6. Add a new record to the table and then embed the first workbook (XSheet1.xls)
  into the General field.

7. Create a form and add the table created in step 6, to the Data Environment of
  the form.

8. Add an OLE Bound Control to the form. Set the ControlSource property of the
  control to the General field, of the table in the form's data environment,
  that contains the embedded Excel sheet. Set the name of the control to
  OLEBoundControl1.

9. Run the form, to display the embedded sheet (XSheet1.xls).

10. Go to the linked sheet, XSheet2.xls in Excel, and change the value of the
  linked cell. Press ENTER or move to another cell to submit the change.

11. Switch to FoxPro and look at the embedded sheet, XSheet1.xls, as displayed
  by the form.

  NOTE: The changes to the linked workbook (XSheet2.XLS) are not reflected on
  the embedded workbook (XSheet1.XLS) as displayed by Visual FoxPro.

12. Close the FoxPro form and then edit the form using the Form Designer.

13. Add the following code to the INIT event and the Refresh of the OLE
  Control:

        This.DoVerb(-3)

14. Repeat steps 9, 10, and 11.

NOTE: The changes to the linked workbook (XSheet2.XLS) are reflected on the
embedded workbook (XSheet1.XLS) as displayed by Visual FoxPro.
