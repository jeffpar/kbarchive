-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
- Microsoft Cluster Server 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After creating more than 900 total resources on Microsoft Cluster Server on
Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition, version 4.0 with Service Pack 3, you may
receive various RPC errors and observe the following events in the System event
log:

  1016 (source CLUSSVC)
  1065 (source CLUCSSVC)
  1000 (source CLUSSVC)
  1069 (source CLUSSVC)

CAUSE
=====

The original release of Cluster Server with Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 does
not support more than 900 resources. These may be any combination of total
resources.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0 and
Microsoft Cluster Server. This problem was first corrected in Windows NT 4.0
Service Pack 4.


MORE INFORMATION
================

In Service Pack 4 and later, the limit is 1,600 resources. To simplify
administration and reduce overhead, use the "share subdirectories" option
provided with the file share resource included in Service Pack 4 and later
service packs. This option allows you to create a single file share resource for
an unlimited number of shares. Set permissions accordingly at the file system
level to protect access to the data to be shared.

The "share subdirectories" option for the file share resource was originally
provided in Service Pack 4 but did not dynamically discover new subdirectories
added while online. Service Pack 5 contains an update to this feature, allowing
new subdirectories to be shared automatically. For additional information, see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q194831 SP4 Cluster Shares Must Be Reset to Recognize Added Subdirectories

The Cluster Service under Windows 2000 Advanced Server and Datacenter Server
contains the same dynamic support for file shares through the "share
subdirectories" option.
