SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using WordMail and you try to automate Word from another program,
you may encounter problems processing some Word commands. For example, you may
receive Automation errors such as "This method or property is not available" or
other errors.

This article describes how to check whether WordMail is running when you are
using Automation to automate Word from another program.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when all of the following conditions are true:

- You use the GetObject function to automate Word from another program.

  -and-

- You are running WordMail as your e-mail editor.

  -and-

- There is a current e-mail message open for editing.

The GetObject function allows you to retrieve the current or running instance of
Word. However, because WordMail uses a hidden or non-visible instance of Word,
GetObject may return the WordMail instance. There is no way to control which
instance of Word is returned.

For example, the following Visual Basic for Applications code sample may cause
the error

  Run-time error '4605': "The Open method or property is not available"

if the current selection is within a WordMail message instead of the Word main
document window:

     Dim wdObj As Word.Application
     Set wdObj = GetObject(, "word.application")
     wdObj.Documents.Open "c:\my documents\doc1.doc"

To determine if the focus is in a WordMail message, use the Selection.Information
property together with the FocusInMailHeader property to determine whether a
WordMail instance or a Word instance has the focus.

FocusInMailHeader Property
--------------------------

The FocusInMailHeader property returns True if the insertion point is in a
WordMail header field (the To field, for example).

Selection.Information Property
------------------------------

Use the Selection.Information property to return information about the specified
or current selection.

The syntax of the Selection.Information property is

     Selection.Information(Type)

where Type is a constant specifying the information to return.

Use wdInWordMail as the Type constant to return a value that indicates the
WordMail location of the selection, as shown in the following table:

  Value       WordMail Location
  -----------------------------
  0(zero)     The selection or range is not in a WordMail message.

  1           The selection or range is in a WordMail send note.

  2           The selection or range is in a WordMail read note.

Example
-------

The following sample code demonstrates how to use these properties to determine
whether WordMail or Word has the current focus:

  Sub CheckForWordMail()
     Dim wdObj As Word.Application
     Dim boolWordMail As Boolean
     ' Initialize values.
     boolWordMail = False
     ' If Word is running or a WordMail e-mail
     ' message is open, use GetObject. If Word
     ' or WordMail is not running, an error will occur.
     On Error Resume Next
     Set wdObj = GetObject(, "word.application")
     If Err.Number = 0 Then
        ' If no error has occurred, call isWordMail Function
        ' to see if Word instance is Word or WordMail.
        boolWordMail = isWordMail(wdObj)
     Else
        ' If an error has occurred, create
        ' new instance of Word.
        Set wdObj = CreateObject("word.application")
        wdObj.Documents.Add
     End If
     If boolWordMail Then
        ' &lt;Code to use for WordMail Instance&gt;,
        ' for example:
        MsgBox "Focus in WordMail."
     Else
        ' &lt;Code to use for Word Instance&gt;,
        ' for example:
        MsgBox "Focus in Word."
     End If
     ' Free the object variable in memory.
     Set wdObj = Nothing
  End Sub

  Function isWordMail(oWord As Word.Application) As Boolean
     ' Is focus in a WordMail Header (To, CC or Subject line)?
     If oWord.Application.FocusInMailHeader Then
        isWordMail = True
        Exit Function
     End If
     ' If not in WordMail Header, is focus in
     ' the body of a WordMail message?
     If oWord.Selection.Information(wdInWordMail) Then
         isWordMail = True
     End If
  End Function
