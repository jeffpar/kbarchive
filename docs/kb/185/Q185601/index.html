SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article demonstrates how to use the FileSystemObject class to
recursively search directories and to find specific files.

Information About the FileSystemObject Class
--------------------------------------------

The FileSystemObject class is located in the Microsoft Scripting Runtime
(Scrrun.dll). To obtain the Scrrun.dll file, install any of the following
packages:

- Microsoft Windows Script Host
- Microsoft Windows NT Option Pack
- Microsoft Internet Information Server 3.0
- Scripting 3.1 upgrade
- Microsoft Visual Studio 98
- Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0

The FileSystemObject class provides better performance than if you use Visual
Basic intrinsic functions such as Dir and GetAttr. Additionally,
FileSystemObject is much simpler to implement that the Visual Basic intrinsic
functions.

Build the Sample
----------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. By default, Form1 is
  created.

2. On the Project menu, click References, and then add a reference to the
  Microsoft Scripting Runtime. If this option is not listed, locate the
  Scrrun.dll file on your system. If you have to, install one of the tools that
  is listed in the Information About the FileSystemObject Class section.

3. Add a CommandButton, a Label, and a ListBox control to Form1. Adjust the
  width of the Label control so that it is the same as the width of the form.

4. Add the following code in the General Declarations section of Form1:

  Option Explicit

  Dim fso As New FileSystemObject
  Dim fld As Folder

  Private Sub Command1_Click()
     Dim nDirs As Long, nFiles As Long, lSize As Currency
     Dim sDir As String, sSrchString As String
     sDir = InputBox("Type the directory that you want to search for", _
                     "FileSystemObjects example", "C:\")
     sSrchString = InputBox("Type the file name that you want to search for", _
                     "FileSystemObjects example", "vb.ini")
     MousePointer = vbHourglass
     Label1.Caption = "Searching " &amp; vbCrLf &amp; UCase(sDir) &amp; "..."
     lSize = FindFile(sDir, sSrchString, nDirs, nFiles)
     MousePointer = vbDefault
     MsgBox Str(nFiles) &amp; " files found in" &amp; Str(nDirs) &amp; _
            " directories", vbInformation
     MsgBox "Total Size = " &amp; lSize &amp; " bytes"
  End Sub

  Private Function FindFile(ByVal sFol As String, sFile As String, _
     nDirs As Long, nFiles As Long) As Currency
     Dim tFld As Folder, tFil As File, FileName As String
     
     On Error GoTo Catch
     Set fld = fso.GetFolder(sFol)
     FileName = Dir(fso.BuildPath(fld.Path, sFile), vbNormal Or _
                    vbHidden Or vbSystem Or vbReadOnly)
     While Len(FileName) &lt;&gt; 0
        FindFile = FindFile + FileLen(fso.BuildPath(fld.Path, _
        FileName))
        nFiles = nFiles + 1
        List1.AddItem fso.BuildPath(fld.Path, FileName)  ' Load ListBox
        FileName = Dir()  ' Get next file
        DoEvents
     Wend
     Label1 = "Searching " &amp; vbCrLf &amp; fld.Path &amp; "..."
     nDirs = nDirs + 1
     If fld.SubFolders.Count &gt; 0 Then
        For Each tFld In fld.SubFolders
           DoEvents
           FindFile = FindFile + FindFile(tFld.Path, sFile, nDirs, nFiles)
        Next
     End If
     Exit Function
  Catch:  FileName = ""
         Resume Next
  End Function

5. Run the project, and then click Command1.

6. Type the directory and the file name to search for. Notice that when each
  file is found, the file name is added to the list box. When the process is
  complete, the number of files that are found is displayed in a message box.
  The total size of the files is also displayed.

Troubleshooting
---------------

- Some files and directories, such as System Volume Information on Microsoft
  Windows XP, cause an access violation if an application tries to access them.
  The error handling code stops looking in a directory when a problem occurs.
  You must use a different approach if you must have a more robust workaround.

- If you use a file filter (such as *.*), a large number of files may be
  returned. The ListBox control can only contain a limited number of
  characters. When that limit is reached, no more entries are added to the list
  box.

- This code sample was tested by using version 5.6.0.6626 of the Microsoft
  Scripting Runtime (Scrrun.dll). If problems occur, you may have to download a
  newer version of this file.
