SYMPTOMS
========

When a form field calculation involves another calculated form field, the
results may be incorrect.

The two scenarios below illustrate this symptom.

Scenario 1: No Formatting in the Number Format of a Form Field
--------------------------------------------------------------

  TYPE OF
  TEXTFORM                                     ACTUAL  EXPECTED
  FIELD          EXPRESSION       BOOKMARK     RESULT   RESULT
  -------------------------------------------------------------
  NUMBER         NONE             Text1         100       100
  CALCULATION    =Text1           Text2         100       100
  CALCULATION    =Text1 + Text2   Text3         100200    200

This results in doubling the value of form field 2 (Text2).

Scenario 2: Dollar Sign on Either or Both Form Fields
-----------------------------------------------------

  TYPE OF
  TEXTFORM                                              ACTUAL  EXPECTED
  FIELD          EXPRESSION     FORMATTING      BKMRK   RESULT   RESULT
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  NUMBER       NONE            Dollar Sign     Text1     100       100
  CALCULATION  =Text1          Dollar Sign     Text2    $100      $100
  CALCULATION  =Text1 + Text2  Doesn't Matter  Text3    $300       200

This results in doubling the value of form field 2 (Text2).

CAUSE
=====

Word defines the bookmarks assigned to the calculation form fields incorrectly.
As a result, Word does not correctly parse these form fields; it concatenates
them instead.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around these problems, use the method appropriate for your situation.

Method 1: Avoid Referring to Any Other Calculation Fields
---------------------------------------------------------

Change the final calculation to avoid referring to any other calculation fields.
Include all math formulas in one calculation field. This method is only
appropriate for simple calculations.

In the earlier example, because the third form field includes a formula from the
second form field, the entry in the third form field expression would need to be
changed to: Text1 (Bookmark from the first form field) + Text1 (Expression from
the second form field).

Method 2: Redefine the Bookmarks So Word Calculates the Formula Correctly
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: You must repeat this procedure each time you change a particular form field
in the Text Form Field Options dialog box.

To redefine the bookmarks so Word calculates the formula correctly, use these
steps with each incorrect Calculation form field:

1. Turn on field code view by pressing ALT+F9.

2. Select the Calculation form field that produces the incorrect results.

  NOTE: Be sure to include the field brackets ({}) in the selection.

3. On the Insert menu, click Bookmark.

  NOTE: The bookmark for the selected form field should be selected.

4. Click Add.

  NOTE: This redefines the bookmark to include the field brackets.

5. Press F9 to update the field, and then press ALT+F9 to switch back to field
  code results view.

The result should now be correct.

Method 3: Define a New Bookmark That Includes the First Calculation Field
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: You do not need to repeat this procedure if you change the form field in
the Text Form Field Options dialog box.

To define a new bookmark that includes the first Calculation field in your
formula plus one space following it, follow these steps:

1. Turn on field code view by pressing ALT+F9.

2. Select the first Calculation form field that is referenced in your FORMULA
  (=) field. Include the space that follows this field in your selection. The
  selection should resemble the following example:

        { FORMTEXT {=Text1}}
        ^                   ^
        |                   |
        Start of            End of
        selection           selection

3. On the Insert menu, click Bookmark.

4. Type a new name in the Bookmark Name box and then click Add.

5. Turn off field code view by pressing ALT+F9.

6. In your second calculation field, use the bookmark you defined in step 4
  above instead of the bookmark that Word set for the first Calculation form
  field.

Method 4: In a Table, Use Table Cell References Rather Than Bookmark Names
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use table cell references rather than bookmark names in the Calculation form
field.

NOTE: This method works only if there are no other Number form fields in any
table cell you reference in your Calculation form field.

For example, change this calculation

  {FORMTEXT {=Text1 + Text2}}

to the following

  {FORMTEXT {=A1 + A2}}

where the Text1 bookmark is in table cell A1 and the Text2 bookmark is in table
cell A2.
