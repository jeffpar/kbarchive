The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running a backup using the Windows NT Backup program against a
Microsoft Exchange Server computer, if the backup is stopped before the backup
completes, Windows NT Backup stops responding (hangs).

CAUSE
=====

When a backup is stopped, the closing procedure blocks infinitely, waiting on a
thread's handle to close. The thread handle is never closed, so Windows NT
Backup stops responding.

RESOLUTION
==========

-------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Microsoft Exchange
Server version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article
