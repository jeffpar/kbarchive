-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Art Gallery for Windows, version 1.0 
- Microsoft Wine Guide for Windows, version 1.0 
- the operating system: Microsoft Windows 95 
- the operating system: Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

NOTE: These problems, with the exception of the Diamond Stealth driver problems,
are corrected in Wine Guide version 1.0a.

Some images in the programs listed at the top of this article may be distorted if
you use:

- Alliance Promotion Windows 95 version 4.0 display driver

- Dell S3 video cards using driver versions 1.34 or earlier, and versions 1.71,
  2.11, 2.21, and 2.22

- Diamond Stealth 64 display drivers version 1.22 or earlier

- Diamond Stealth Pro using version 2.01

- Trident TGUI 9420 DGi

- Trident CXI Linear Addressing

- Video Logic 928 Movie driver 1.01

NOTE: This problem may also occur if you use other video cards based on an S3
chipset.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, contact the manufacturer of the video card for an
updated driver or configuration information, or see the workarounds in the More
Information section below.

If you are using a Trident video card, try using the Windows Super VGA driver.
This driver is included with newer packages of Windows, and is also on the Wine
Guide CD.

If you are using a video card with the S3 801/805 chip set, you can try
installing the S3 drivers that have been included on the Microsoft Wine Guide
CD.


NOTE: These generic S3 801/805 drivers (versions 1.32 or 2.41) are not necesarily
the latest version, and may not be fully compatible with other applications or
your PC configuration. S3 drivers are not supported by Microsoft or by S3, Inc.,
but are provided for your convenience only. For full support of video driver
issues, please contact your hardware vendor. For further instructions on the
installation of these drivers, please refer to the Readme.txt file located on
the Microsoft Wine Guide CD-ROM.

MORE INFORMATION
================

IMPORTANT: Before changing your video driver or modifying the System.ini file,
make a backup copy of your System.ini file in case your new video driver
configuration does not work correctly. For more information about how to perform
this task in Windows, see your Windows printed documentation or online Help.

Video Logic 928 Movie Driver 1.01 Resolution
--------------------------------------------

If the screen is distorted and you have no animations, obtain 928 Movie driver
version 1.1.1 from Video Logic.

Diamond Stealth 64 Display Driver Workarounds
---------------------------------------------

To correct this problem, do the following:

1. Diamond recommends adding the following line to the [STLTH64.DRV] section of
  the System.ini file to correct display and animation problems:

  "DEVICEBITMAPS=1" (without the quotation marks)

  This is set to 0 by default.

  NOTE: If you have installed the Diamond Stealth 64 Vram card, the
  DEVICEBITMAPS= line is located in the [diamond] section of the System.ini
  file (not the [STLTH64.DRV] section). If the DEVICEBITMAPS=1 line does not
  exist, it needs to be added.

  CAUTION: This is not a permanent solution. Adding this line may cause
  unpredictable side effects in other applications. It has been reported that
  the DEVICEBITMAPS=1 setting may correct images only and not animations.

2. Use at least 64K colors.

3. If you are using the Diamond Stealth 64 Dram card, obtain a driver newer than
  version 1.22. This step applies to Dram card users only. It does not apply to
  Vram card users. Images will still be distorted at a 256- color depth.
  However, higher color depths, such as 64,000, look fine. Animations will not
  run at greater than 256 colors.

To obtain the Diamond Stealth 64 display drivers, contact:

- Technical support: (408) 325-7100

- BBS support 2400 - 14400: (408) 325-7080

- BBS support 9600 - 28800: (408) 325-7175

- www.diamondmm.com

- ftp.diamondmm.com

Diamond Stealth Pro:

Diamond recommends adding the following line to the [STEALTH.DRV] section of the
System.ini file to correct display and animation problems:

  "DEVICEBITMAPS=1" (without the quotation marks)

This is set to 0 by default.
