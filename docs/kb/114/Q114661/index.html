MORE INFORMATION
================

This update contains Splus.dll, a replacement for the Splus.dll file that is
included with version 1.0 of Microsoft Schedule+ Libraries. This replacement
file corrects the following problems:

- If you have seven or more projects defined in Schedule+ and you use the
  Schedule+ API to add a task to a project, a general- protection (GP) fault
  occurs in Demilayr.dll.

- Under certain conditions, if you try to add a task or appointment to another
  user's .cal file without Create privileges, an application error or general
  protection fault may occur. This problem has been fixed in Splus.dll version
  1.00.4002.

This update also contains information on the Schedule+ Access Libraries (SAL).
The SAL allow users to develop applications that manipulate Schedule+
appointments and tasks and exchange meeting messages among Schedule+ users.
Portions of the libraries require Simple Messaging Applications Programming
Interface (MAPI).


To Update your Splus.dll File
-----------------------------

1. After you download Splus.exe to a new folder, type "splus" (without the
  quotation marks) at the MS-DOS prompt to extract the contents of the file.

2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

  copy &lt;path&gt;:\splus.dll &lt;destination&gt;

where &lt;path&gt; is the drive and folder where you ran the self-extracting
Splus.exe file, and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and folder where your
Splus.dll file currently resides.

For example, if you ran the self-extracting file from the Test folder on drive D,
and your Splus.dll file is located in the System folder on drive C, type the
following command:

  copy d:\test\splus.dll c:\windows\system
