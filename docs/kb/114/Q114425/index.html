The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This article discusses using Microsoft Windows for Workgroups with a floppy
disk configuration. Although the information outlined in this article does
allow Windows for Workgroups to access the network from a floppy disk,
Microsoft does not support this procedure. If the steps or procedures
described in this article do not function properly, a standard Windows for
Workgroups configuration should be used to access the network.

SUMMARY
=======

The steps below describe how to create a bootable floppy disk that loads the
real-mode network, which allows you to connect to a Windows for Workgroups 3.11
server. Once connected to the server, a full or a network setup (SETUP /N) can
be run to a local hard disk drive or to a directory on a server machine. This
setup disk is ideal for running a large number of installations to local hard
disk drives without needing the Windows for Workgroups 3.11 disks for each
installation.

This article assumes the following things:

- The network hardware is already installed.

- All machines are using the same network adapter card with the same hardware
  settings. (If different network cards are being used, follow the instructions
  in the note in step 3.)

- The workstation has at least 4 megabytes (MB) of RAM if run from a diskless
  workstation or 3 MB of RAM if run from a machine with a hard disk drive.

- SETUP /A will be installed to a C:\WINSHARE directory.

- SETUP /N will be installed to a C:\directory.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Create a bootable floppy disk.

  NOTE: If you are using MS-DOS 6.x and you are not using DoubleSpace, you can
  delete the DBLSPACE.BIN file from the floppy disk to create more disk space.

2. Run an administrative installation (SETUP /A) of Windows for Workgroups 3.11
  to a C:\WINSHARE directory. This machine will be referred to as the server
  machine.

3. From the C:\WINSHARE directory, run a shared network installation (SETUP /N)
  to the server's hard disk drive (for example C:\KBNETWORK). Use the Custom
  Setup option to perform the following steps:

  a. Clear the Set Up Printers and "Set Up Applications Already on Hard
     Disk(s)" check boxes.

  b. Select None for the Swapfile setting.

  NOTE: To create a second floppy disk for a different type of network adapter
  card, simply repeat step 3 but choose a different directory name when you run
  SETUP /N. Ensure that the appropriate network adapter card and its settings
  are detected during Setup.

4. Delete the following files from the C:\directory to free additional disk
  space for the floppy disk:

  *.CLN
  *.WIN
  BOOTLOG.TXT
  EMM386.EXE
  MOUSE.INI
  MSCDEX.EXE
  NCDINFO.INI
  SPART.PAR

5. Copy the contents of the C:\directory to the root of the floppy disk you
  formatted in step 1.

6. Create an AUTOEXEC.BAT file and a CONFIG.SYS file on the floppy disk with at
  least the following entries:

         CONFIG.SYS
         ==========

         Files=30
         Buffers=20
         Lastdrive=z
         Device=A:\HIMEM.SYS
         Device=A:\IFSHLP.SYS
         Device=A:\RAMDRIVE.SYS 1024 512 512 /E
         &lt;Third-party disk partitioner&gt;
         &lt;Third-party disk-compression driver&gt;
         &lt;Other necessary third-party driver&gt;

  NOTE: If the workstation has a hard disk drive, the Device=A:\RAMDRIVE.SYS is
  not necessary and can be removed from the CONFIG.SYS file.

         AUTOEXEC.BAT
         ============

         A:\SMARTDRV A+
         Path=a:\;w:
         A:\NET LOGON UserName Password
         A:\NET USE W: &lt;\\SERVER&gt;\&lt;ShareName&gt; /p:No
         Set Temp=C:\ 

  NOTE: &lt;\\SERVER&gt; is the name of the machine that contains the Setup /A
  (C:\WINSHARE) copy of Windows for Workgroups. &lt;\\ShareName&gt; is the name
  given to the C:\WINSHARE directory when it is shared. (See step 9 for more
  information.)

7. Edit the SYSTEM.INI file on the floppy disk and set the DEVDIR entry in the
  [Network Drivers] section to equal A:\.

8. Edit the SYSTEM.INI file in the C:\directory and delete the AutoStart=FULL
  line from the [Network] section.

9. Reboot the server machine and run Windows from the hard disk drive. Share the
  C:\WINSHARE directory from File Manager.

10. Boot a workstation with the floppy disk you created.

  NOTE: The first time you use this floppy disk, you must reenter the password
  you entered in the logon line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

11. At the A:\ prompt, change to the W: drive and install Windows for Workgroups
  to this workstation's hard disk drive, or just run Windows from the floppy
  disk by typing "win" (without the quotation marks).

NOTE: If you need help using the network commands at the MS-DOS command prompt,
you type "net /?" (without the quotation marks) or "net use /?" (without the
quotation marks) to access online help and syntax for most network commands.
