SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Windows NT Workstation and Windows NT Server version 3.5 contain code
that Adaptec AHA154x SCSI controllers use to detect BIOS conflicts with other
network or video adapters.

MORE INFORMATION
================

BIOS conflicts are sometimes interpreted as driver problems. The driver uses the
Adaptec code to report to the system where its BIOS appears in memory, and the
system uses this information to detect conflicts with other cards.

When a conflict is detected, it may appear as though the driver caused the
conflict because your computer performed normally before the conflict was
detected or still does in MS-DOS. This is deceiving because many problems caused
by BIOS conflicts are subtle and not noticed for months of operation. Following
are some of the more noticeable symptoms:

- A warm reboot causes the AHA154x to "go away."

- The floppy drive doesn't work reliably, even on systems that use an internal
  non-Adaptec floppy controller.

- The video driver's colors are incorrect.

- Network transfer causes data corruption.

Detected BIOS conflicts are described in the event log, and conflicting cards are
identified. Use the vendor's manual to adjust BIOS locations and eliminate
conflicts.


The AHA154x line of SCSI controllers manufactured by Adaptec, a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
this product's performance or reliability.
