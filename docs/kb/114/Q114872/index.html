-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
- Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Typically, only the Windows NT installation that created a volume set, stripe
set without parity, mirror set or stripe set with parity recognizes and is able
to use that set. However, another installation of Windows NT or Windows NT
Advanced Server can be enabled to recognize and use the set by using Disk
Administrator to save the disk configuration information in the Windows NT
installation that created the volume and then restoring the information under
the other Windows NT installation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

See pages 528 and 529 of the Windows NT Advanced Server "System Guide" for the
specific steps to saving and restoring disk configuration information.

Once the disk configuration information from another installation of Windows NT
is restored, the current installation will recognize and be able to use the
volume sets, stripe sets with and without parity, and mirror sets created by
another installation of Windows NT. After disk configuration information is
restored:

- Installations of Windows NT Advanced Server can perform any function on a
  volume created by another installation of Windows NT that they could perform
  on volumes they created. This includes breaking mirrors and regenerating
  stripe sets with parity.

  -AND-

- Installations of Windows NT can perform any function on a volume set or
  stripe without parity created by another installation of Windows NT that they
  could perform on volumes sets or stripes without parity that they created.
  They can also recognize, read from and write to mirror sets and stripe sets
  with parity created by Windows NT Advanced Server. However, Windows NT cannot
  break a mirror set or regenerate a stripe set with parity. In the event a
  partition is lost in a mirror set or stripe set with parity, recovery of the
  lost partition must be performed by Windows NT Advanced Server.
