-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, versions 2.0, 7.0 
- Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Calendar control included with Microsoft Access 97, Microsoft Access for
Windows 95 version 7.0, and the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit (ADT)
versions 2.0 and 7.0, you can change the formatting of all the text, but you
cannot change the formatting of individual dates.

CAUSE
=====

This is a design limitation of the Calendar control.

RESOLUTION
==========

This article assumes that you are familiar with Visual Basic for Applications
and with creating Microsoft Access applications using the programming tools
provided with Microsoft Access. For more information about Visual Basic for
Applications, please refer to your version of the "Building Applications with
Microsoft Access" manual.

NOTE: Visual Basic for Applications is called Access Basic in Microsoft Access
version 2.0. For more information about Access Basic, please refer to the
"Building Applications" manual.

A workaround for this behavior is to use a text box on your form that reflects
the date selected in the Calendar control. The following example demonstrates
how to create such a text box:

1. From the Database window, do one of the following.

   - In Microsoft Access 97:

     In Design view, open the form to which you want to add the text box. On the
     Insert menu, click ActiveX Control, and then select Calendar Control 8.0.
     After you have selected the Calendar control, click OK.

   - In Microsoft Access 7.0:

     In Design view, open the form to which you want to add the text box. On the
     Insert menu, click Custom Control, and then select the Calendar control.
     After you have selected the Calendar control, click OK.

   - In Microsoft Access 2.0:

     In Design view, open the form to which you want to add the text box. On the
     Edit menu, click Insert Object and then select the Insert Control option
     button. In the Control Type box, select Calendar Control. If the Calendar
     control does not appear in the box, click the Add Control button and
     select the MSASB20.OCX file from your ADT directory. After you have
     selected the Calendar control, click OK.

2. Change the Calendar control's Name property to Calendar1.

3. Add a new text box to the form. Change the text box's Name property to
  CalendarDate.

4. To display the form's module, select the Calendar control, click the
  control's OnClick property field, click the Build button to the right of the
  field, select Code Builder, and then click OK.

5. Enter the appropriate code so that the procedure looks as follows.

  NOTE: In the following sample code, an underscore (_) at the end of a line is
  used as a line-continuation character. Remove the underscore from the end of
  the line when re-creating this code in Access Basic.

        Sub calendar1_Click ()
           Me!calendardate.value = Format(Me!calendar1.object.value, _
                "dddddd")
        End Sub

  This procedure sets the value of the CalendarDate text box to the value of the
  date selected in the Calendar control, with a Long Date format. Note that you
  can use the format of your choice--you do not have to use the Long Date
  format.

6. Close the module.

7. View the form in Form view, and select different dates.

STATUS
======

Changes to the Calendar control are being reviewed and will be considered for
possible inclusion in a future release of the Microsoft Office Developer Edition
Tools.
