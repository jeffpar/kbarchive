The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Rdisk tool to update the repair information on a computer that
is running Windows NT 4.0, a temporary file is created that enumerates all of
the registry hives and their current settings. The permissions on this file do
not prevent anyone from reading or changing the temporary file's contents while
Rdisk is running.

When the Rdisk tool completes the update procedure, the temporary file is
deleted. However, if the Rdisk tool is interrupted or ends abnormally (requiring
a restart), the file may still be accessed after the computer is rebooted. The
file can also be read while the Rdisk tool is running.
