  before any directory functions can occur.

- BindResponse

  This response either allows or denies the bind request.

- UnbindRequest

  This request terminates a session with the server. No response is required.

- SearchRequest

  This request initiates a search for a specific entry in the directory.

- SearchResponse

  This response sends the search result to the client.

- ModifyRequest

  This is a request to modify a directory entry.

- ModifyResponse

  This response sends the result of a requested modification.

- AddRequest

  This is a request to add a directory entry.

- AddResponse

  This response sends the result of a request to add a directory entry.

- DelRequest

  This is a request made by the client to delete a directory entry.

- DelResponse

  This response sends the result of a delete request.

- ModifyRDNRequest

  This is a request made by the client to modify the Relative Distinguished
  Name (RDN) of a directory object.

- ModifyRDNResponse

  This is a response sent by the server to the client with the result of a
  requested RDN modification.

- CompareDNRequest

  This is a request made by the client to compare a string with the
  Distinguished Name (DN) of a directory object.

- CompareDNResponse

  This is a response sent by the server to the client with the result of a DN
  comparison.
