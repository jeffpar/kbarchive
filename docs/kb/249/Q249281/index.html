-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
- Microsoft COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS, versions 1.0, 1.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a COM Transaction Integrator for CICS and IMS (COMTI) method contains an
input parameter that is defined as a float or double Automation data type and is
assigned the maximum possible numeric value for the data type, COMTI may
generate a 1507 exception error if the Error Handling option is set to Rounded
in Component Builder (CB) for the data type. Additionally, if the parameter is
returned from the host, COMTI may generate a 1564 exception error when it
attempts to process or convert the arriving data. For example, a COBOL data type
of PIC 9(3)V9(8) with an Automation input mapping of double causes the following
Windows NT event to occur if a value of 999.999999999 is assigned to the
variable and the 'Rounded' option is set in CB:

  (1507) The magnitude of the sending field exceeds the output field for
  parameter Parameter1 in method Method1.

The size of the number in the parameter is too large to be placed into the
resulting data type. Check for a client application error and correct. If the
client application is correct consider modifying the data conversion mapping so
that the parameter is converted to a data type capable of accepting the numeric
value.

If the PIC 9(3)V9(8) field is returned from the host program with a value of
999.99999999, then the following error message is posted:

  (1564) An error occurred when attempting to acquire the allow variable length
  property for parameter Parameter1 in method Method1.

The COM Transaction Integrator runtime is unable to correctly read the COM
Transaction Integrator-created component library. Try to open the component
library with the COM Transaction Integrator Component Builder on the runtime
computer. If you cannot open the component library, rebuild it, or attempt to
acquire a new copy from the original source and re-deploy it. If you can open
the component library with the COM Transaction Integrator, try shutting down MTS
Server processes, and then remove the component library from the MTS package and
re-deploy it.

CAUSE
=====

COMTI does not handle the conversion of float or double data types when the
maximum numeric value is used.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Product Name service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

+------------------------------------+
| File name       | Date     | Time  | 
+------------------------------------+
| Convertprim.dll | xx/xx/xx | xx:xx | 
+------------------------------------+

NOTE: Date and time information will be provided as soon as it becomes
available.


NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft SNA Server version
4.0, 4.0SP1, 4.0SP2, and 4.0SP3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

One of the primary features of COMTI is the ability to convert and format a
method's parameters from the representation understandable by the Windows NT
platform into the representation understandable by a mainframe transaction
program (TP). The conversion is defined at design time and implemented at run
time. At design time, the developer uses CB to associate or map an Automation
data type with a COBOL data type. COMTI provides default mappings between
standard Automation data types and COBOL data types, and the developer can
either accept the default mappings or override the default with other mappings
supported by COMTI. The mappings are recorded by CB in the COMTI component
library (typelib). When a developer uses the Floating Point Binary data type,
the likelihood of a data conversion precision problem increases if fractions are
involved. COMTI's CB offers the following three options to handle data precision
errors:

   - Round (default)

- Truncate

- Error

When you define a COBOL data type of PIC 9(N)v9(N)COMP-3 (or DISPLAY), the
default value presented in CB is of type Double and the precision error handler
is set to Round. Under these circumstances, if the maximum value for the
parameter is used, whether you are sending or receiving data, COMTI generates an
error.
