-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
- Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you use Outlook Web Access (OWA) to create appointments that fall in the
seven days before the last Sunday in October of any given year, the start and
end times may appear to be shifted one hour ahead if you view them by using
Microsoft Outlook. For some time zones this may also happen for dates in the
seven days before the last Sunday in September. In some cases the appointments
are also displayed incorrectly in OWA even though they were created there.

CAUSE
=====

In 1996, the European Union (EU) standardized a EU-wide daylight saving period
that starts on the last Sunday in March and ends on the last Sunday in October.
Before the standardization, some EU countries implemented a daylight saving time
that ended on the last Sunday in September. The Collaboration Data Objects (CDO)
libraries didn't implement this change properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To manually install this hotfix you need the Microsoft Register Server program,
Regsvr32.exe. The Regsvr32.exe file is usually installed in your
Windows\System32 folder. If you cannot locate the Regsvr32.exe file on your
computer, you can obtain it from the Microsoft Download Center. For additional
information about where to obtain the Regsvr32.exe file, click the article

After you obtain the Regsvr32.exe file, you must perform the following steps to
install this hotfix:

NOTE: The paths used in the steps, such as C:\Winnt\System32 or C:\Exchsrvr\Bin,
may be different on your system, depending on your installation of Microsoft
Windows NT Server or Microsoft Exchange Server.

1. Copy the Regsvr32.exe file to your Windows\System32 folder.

2. Stop all of the services that are related to Internet Information Server
  (IIS).

3. Stop all of the Exchange Server services.

4. Unregister the current Cdo.dll file; at a command prompt, type "regsvr32 /u
  c:\winnt\system32\cdo.dll" (without the quotation marks). A dialog box is
  displayed that indicates the success of this operation.

5. Unregister the current Cdohtml.dll file; at a command prompt, type "regsvr32
  /u c:\exchsrvr\bin\cdohtml.dll" (without the quotation marks). A dialog box
  is displayed that indicates the success of this operation.

6. Copy build 2651.70 of the Cdo.dll file to the C:\Winnt\System32 folder.

7. Copy build 2651.70 of the Cdohtml.dll file to the C:\Exchsrvr\Bin folder.

8. Register the new Cdo.dll file; at a command prompt, type "regsvr32
  c:\winnt\system32\cdo.dll" (without the quotation marks).

9. Register the new Cdohtml.dll file; at a command prompt, type "regsvr32
  c:\exchsrvr\bin\cdohtml.dll" (without the quotation marks).

10. Restart all of the IIS-related services.

11. Restart all of the Exchange Server services.

12. For each client that requires OWA to the mailbox calendar, connect to the
  client mailbox by using OWA, and in the left pane, click Calendar, and then
  click Options to ensure that the appropriate time zone is configured. Click
  OK to save configuration changes.
