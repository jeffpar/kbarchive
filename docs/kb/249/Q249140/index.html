The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5, 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
- Microsoft Windows 2000 Advanced Server

- Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You can use Server Manager (Srvmgr.exe) to synchronize the user account database
of a Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000 domain. If you use the Windows NT 4.0
version of Server Manager to trigger synchronization in a domain with a Windows
2000 primary domain controller (PDC), Active Directory replication may not
work.

You can use Replmon.exe to search for all domain controllers with unsuccessful
replication. An example output follows:

  Active Directory Replication Domain Controller Replication Failure
  Output Printed at 12/3/1999 6:03:41 AM

  Below are the replication failures detected on Domain Controllers
  for this domain:

  Domain Controller Name: DCNAME00
  Directory Partition:    DC=domain,DC=corp
  Replication Partner:    Domain\DCNAME01
  Failure Code:           5
  Failure Reason:         Access is denied.

Additionally, the Internet Service Manager (ISM) service on the server may not
start and may display an SEC_E_LOGON_DENIED error code.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the synchronization request generated by the
Windows NT 4.0 version of Server Manager triggers a computer account password
reset operation. After the password is changed, the PDC cannot establish a
secure replication channel between itself and its partner domain controllers.

RESOLUTION
==========

A new version of Srvmgr.exe is available for use in mixed-mode domains, with
Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 domain controllers. This version of Srvmgr.exe
checks to see if the PDC is a Windows 2000 domain controller. If it is a Windows
2000 domain controller, the password reset operation is not triggered.
