- Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a virtual directory on an Internet Information Server (IIS) computer is
mapped to a Universal Naming Convention (UNC) share, and a request for a file in
the directory contains one of several particular characters at the end of the
request, the expected Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI)
extension processing may not occur. This can result in the source code of the
file being sent to the browser.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can be caused by the use of a varying combination of special
characters at the end of the clients request.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows 2000
------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows 2000. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

STATUS
======

Windows 2000
------------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Services
5.0. This problem was first corrected in Windows 2000 Service Pack 1.

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Server 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There are significant restrictions that increase the difficulty of exploiting
this vulnerability:

- By design, virtual directories hide the actual location of files. Under most
  circumstances, there is no way for an attacker to determine which files on a
  server actually reside on a UNC share.

- Many browsers "correct" requests that contain the trailing characters at
  issue here by either removing the characters or changing them.

- If recommended security practices are followed, ASP and other files that
  require server-side processing will not contain any sensitive information to
  compromise.

This fix eliminates the vulnerability by removing the trailing special characters
if they are included in the request. This causes the appropriate scripting
engine to process the file when the request is returned to the browser. If the
request is improperly formatted, the request is denied, and then returned to the
client as an invalid request.
