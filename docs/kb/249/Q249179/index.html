- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you right-click Distribution Points and then click New Distribution Point,
it can take a long time to display the list of existing distribution points.
This occurs only in large site hierarchies. The larger the site hierarchy is,
the longer the delay. With 200 sites, the delay can be approximately 3 minutes.
With 10,000 sites, they delay can be significantly longer.

CAUSE
=====

The query that is performed during this operation gathers some information that
is not actually necessary for the operation.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q288239 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in

MORE INFORMATION

Console. Note that installations of the SMS Administrative Microsoft Management
Console Snap-In on remote machines is affected by this issue as well, so this
