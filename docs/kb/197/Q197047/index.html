SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Cluster Server (MSCS) has the ability to define a specific node in the
cluster as the preferred node that is to own a particular group. If for any
reason this node fails or goes offline, you can set the Cluster service to
automatically move these groups back to the node that you want to. This is
useful in statically load-balancing the nodes in your cluster. This is referred
to as Failover and Failback policies.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Setting Failover Policy
-----------------------

To set the Failover policy for a group, use the Failover tab for the group. You
can set the failover threshold and the failover period. The failover threshold
is the number of times the group can fail over within the number of hours
specified by the failover period. For example, if a group failover threshold is
set to 5, and its failover period set to 3, Cluster Server will failover the
group at most five times within a three hour period. The next time a resource in
the group exceeds its failure threshold count, Cluster Server will leave the
resource in the offline state instead of failing over the group.

NOTE: A group itself does not fail. Only when the following conditions are met
for a resource within the group, will the group attempt a failover thus
incrementing the Group's failover count.

- The number of failures for a specific resource has exceeded its threshold
  count within the defined period.
- The resource is defined to "Affect the group".

This failover will increment the count for the Group failover threshold by one.

Setting Failback Policy
-----------------------

By default, groups are set not to failback. Unless you manually configure your
group to failback after failover, it continues to run on the alternate node
after the failed node comes back online.

When you configure a group to automatically failback to the preferred node, you
specify whether you want the group to failback as soon as the preferred node is
available or to failback only during specific hours that you define. This option
is useful if you want the failback to occur after peak business hours, or if you
want to make sure the preferred node is able to support the group when it does
come back online.

The group must be configured to have a preferred owner to failback. You can
specify a preferred owner on the General tab of the group Properties dialog
box.

NOTE: The "Preferred Owner" of a group must be specified for failback to occur.
The preferred owner is the node that one configures to (under normal operating
circumstances) to host the group. Furthermore, on a resource level, the resource
must be configured to have both nodes as "Possible Owners" for the resource to
failover.

Testing Failover Polices
------------------------

You can test the failover policies you establish for a single group and its
resources by manually failing over those elements.

To test the failover policy for a group, type 0 (zero) for the Threshold in the
Properties dialog box for a specific resource. Then, right-click on that
resource and click Initiate Failure. Cluster Server immediately fails over the
group to the alternate node.

In a test environment, you can fail over all groups from one node to another by
using Cluster Administrator to stop the Cluster Server, pressing the reset
button on the computer, or turning off the power to one of the nodes.

NOTE: Removing the shared SCSI/Fibre cable between either node and the shared
disk array is not a valid failover test. The cluster service must have access to
the shared array at all times for failover to succeed.
