The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a message to one or more recipients, and then a rule causes the
message to be forwarded to another recipient, the forwarded message may not
appear correctly when the recipient opens it in an e-mail client. Specifically,
the recipient may experience either of the following symptoms:

- If the original message contains a picture at the very beginning of the
  message, the "Auto forwarded by a Rule" text may appear after the picture
  instead of at the beginning of the forwarded message.

- If the original message contains a Rich Text Format (RTF) object or field at
  the very beginning of the message, the "Auto forwarded by a Rule" text may
  appear in the wrong RTF section in the forwarded message or may not appear at
  all.

CAUSE
=====

The information store normally attempts to locate the beginning of the RTF body
by locating the first printable character. However, if the message contains a
picture or another RTF object at the very beginning of the message, then the RTF
body starts with that object instead of a printable character. Similarly, if the
message contains an RTF field at the very beginning of the message, then the RTF
field must be processed before the first printable character can be located.
Under these conditions, the information store may be unable to locate the
beginning of the RTF body.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:
