SUMMARY
=======

The Windows taskbar has an AutoHide property that allows it to hide at the very
edge of the screen, taking up very little space, until the mouse is positioned
directly over it, which causes it reappear at it's normal size. When you set the
AutoHide property, a maximized window covers the entire screen. If you do not
set the AutoHide property, a maximized window covers the entire screen except
for the area occupied by the taskbar.

MORE INFORMATION
================

There is no programmatic way to change the AutoHide property in Microsoft
Windows. To size a Visual Basic form so that it fills the entire screen,
including covering the taskbar if it is showing, you must explicitly set the
height and width of the window.

In the following sample code, the SetWindowPos API enables the specified window
to cover the entire screen, including covering all taskbars. This or any similar
approach only works if the window is not already maximized. If the window is
currently maximized, you must first set the window to a restored/normal state
prior to using the SetWindowPos API.

Step-by-Step Procedures
-----------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a CommandButton to Form1.

3. Paste the following code into Form1's code window:

        Private Sub Command1_Click()
           Dim cx As Long
           Dim cy As Long
           Dim RetVal As Long

           ' Determine if screen is already maximized.
           If Me.WindowState = vbMaximized Then
              ' Set window to normal size
              Me.WindowState = vbNormal
           End If

           ' Get full screen width.
           cx = GetSystemMetrics(SM_CXSCREEN)

           ' Get full screen height.
           cy = GetSystemMetrics(SM_CYSCREEN)

           ' Call API to set new size of window.
           RetVal = SetWindowPos(Me.hwnd, HWND_TOP, 0, 0, cx, cy, _
              SWP_SHOWWINDOW)
        End Sub

4. Add a standard module to the Project menu.

5. Paste the following code into the module:

        Declare Function SetWindowPos Lib "user32" (ByVal hwnd As Long, _
           ByVal hWndInsertAfter As Long, ByVal x As Long, ByVal y As Long, _
           ByVal cx As Long, ByVal cy As Long, ByVal wFlags As Long) As Long

        Declare Function GetSystemMetrics Lib "user32" _
           (ByVal nIndex As Long) As Long

        Public Const SM_CXSCREEN = 0
        Public Const SM_CYSCREEN = 1
        Public Const HWND_TOP = 0
        Public Const SWP_SHOWWINDOW = &amp;H40

6. Run the project.

7. Click the CommandButton.

RESULT: The form will cover the entire screen, including any taskbars.

This works for all taskbars on the primary monitor, including the shell's taskbar
and any other taskbars (such as the Microsoft Office taskbar) that are written
to use the standard Desktop Application Toolbar interface.
