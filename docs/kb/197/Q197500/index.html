-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A backup program stops responding (hangs) while you are attempting to back up an
Exchange Server database.

CAUSE
=====

Backup programs that attempt to use large buffers to read data from an Exchange
Server computer are susceptible to this problem. When an attempt is made to back
up a server using a large buffer, the backup program initiates the read attempt
and waits for data to be read into the buffer. Because the buffer is large, a
problem allocating memory for this buffer may result on the server, causing the
read on the server to fail. Because no data will be returned to the backup
program, the backup program will wait indefinitely.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack
