The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator: WWII Europe Series, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to import Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 scenery to
use in Combat Flight Simulator.

NOTE: The procedure you use to import scenery in Combat Flight Simulator is
different than the procedure you use to import scenery in Flight Simulator 98.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You cannot damage or blow up scenery and buildings imported from Flight
Simulator 98. Buildings you import from Flight Simulator 98 may also look
different in Combat Flight Simulator.

Importing Flight Simulator 98 Scenery
-------------------------------------

To use Flight Simulator 98 scenery files in Combat Flight Simulator, follow these
steps:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type the following line, and then click OK

  &lt;drive&gt;:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator\Scenery

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter of the hard disk on which Flight
  Simulator is installed.

3. Right-click the World.vis file, and then click Copy.

4. On the Edit menu, click Paste.

5. Right-click the "Copy of World.vis" file, and then click Rename.

6. Type "World1.vis" (without the quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

7. Right-click the World1.vis file, and then click Copy.

8. Click Start, and then click Run.

9. In the Open box, type the following line, and then click OK

  &lt;drive&gt;:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Combat Flight Simulator\Scenery

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter of the hard disk on which Combat
  Flight Simulator is installed.

10. On the Edit menu, click Paste.

11. Close all open windows.

12. Start Combat Flight Simulator.

13. On the startup screen, click Free Flight, and then click Fly Now.

14. On the World menu, click Scenery Library. When you receive the warning
  message, click OK.

15. In the Scenery Worlds box, click FS98 World, and then click OK.

16. Quit and then restart Combat Flight Simulator.

Combat Flight Simulator may take a few moments to load the Flight Simulator 98
scenery files.

To switch back to Combat Flight Simulator scenery, repeat steps 12-16, selecting
Combat Flight Simulator in the Scenery Worlds box.

NOTE: If you used the Complete option to install Flight Simulator 98, or if you
did not install Flight Simulator 98 in the default folder, you must edit the
paths for the scenery files after you complete these steps. To do this, proceed
to the "Manually Editing the Path to Scenery Files" section.

Using Flight Simulator 98 Scenery Textures
------------------------------------------

To see textures for imported Flight Simulator 98 scenery in Combat Flight
Simulator, copy the texture files from the Flight Simulator 98 texture folder to
the Combat Flight Simulator texture folder. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type the following line, and then click OK

  &lt;drive&gt;:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator\Texture

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter of the hard disk on which Flight
  Simulator is installed.

3. On the Edit menu, click Select All.

4. On the Edit menu, click Copy.

5. Click Start, and then click Run.

6. In the Open box, type the following line, and then click OK

  &lt;drive&gt;:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Combat Flight Simulator\Texture

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter of the hard disk on which Combat
  Flight Simulator is installed.

7. On the Edit menu, click Paste.

8. When you are prompted to replace duplicate files, click Yes To All.

9. Close all open windows.

Using Theater Scenery with Flight Simulator 98 Scenery
------------------------------------------------------

When you use the World1.vis file from Flight Simulator 98, the Theater scenery
from Combat Flight Simulator is not available. If you want to use both the
Theater scenery and the Flight Simulator 98 scenery at the same time, add the
Combat Flight Simulator scenery as a scenery area. To do this, follow these
steps:

1. Start Combat Flight Simulator.

2. On the startup screen, click Free Flight, and then click Fly Now.

3. On the World menu, click Scenery Library. When you receive the warning
  message, click OK.

4. In the Scenery Worlds box, click Add.

5. In the Scenery Area Path box, type the following line, and then click OK

  &lt;drive&gt;:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Combat Flight
  Simulator\Scenery\All

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter of the hard disk on which Combat
  Flight Simulator is installed.

Manually Editing the Path to Scenery Files
------------------------------------------

By default, Flight Simulator 98 is installed to the following folder:

  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator

If you installed Flight Simulator 98 to a different folder than the default
folder, or if you selected the Complete installation option, you must manually
edit the path to each scenery file you want to use in Combat Flight Simulator.
To do this, follow these steps:

1. Start Combat Flight Simulator.

2. On the startup screen, click Free Flight, and then click Fly Now.

3. On the World menu, click Scenery Library. When you receive the warning
  message, click OK.

4. Click Files.

5. In the Scenery Areas box, click a scenery area you want to use in Combat
  Flight Simulator, and then click Edit.

6. In the Scenery Area Path box, type the path to the folder that contains the
  Flight Simulator 98 scenery (.bgl) files, and then click OK.

7. Repeat steps 4-6 for each Flight Simulator 98 scenery area you want to use in
  Combat Flight Simulator.

8. When you finish adding scenery areas to Combat Flight Simulator, click OK,
  and then click OK again.

If you installed Flight Simulator 98 using the Complete installation option, you
must also use these steps to change the path for the US Great Lakes scenery
area, located by default in the following folder:

  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator\Scenery\Usgl

To use the Flight Simulator 98 Chicago scenery in Combat Flight Simulator, copy
the Chicago folder from the Flight Simulator 98 Scenery folder to the Combat
Flight Simulator Scenery folder.
