The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

This article describes which font is displayed in Microsoft Word when you open a
document from a nontextual foreign file format. Special exceptions to the
general functionality are noted in the "More Information" section later in this
article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

How Fonts Are Mapped During Initial Import
------------------------------------------

1. If Word uses an external converter dynamic-link library (DLL) to interpret a
  foreign document and that converter supports font mapping, the converter
  first analyzes font metrics and determines whether any of the fonts in the
  foreign file match the list of fonts in its font- mapping (substitution)
  table.

   - If a source font from the document matches an entry in the table, the
     converter supplies the coinciding target Windows font from the table to
     Word.

   - If there is no match for the font, the converter supplies Word with the
     nearest equivalent font family and font name, based on its analysis of the
     font's metrics.

     NOTE: Prior to supplying a font name to Word, the WordPerfect 5.x converter
     also queries the system to identify the current printer driver and
     availability of target printer font possibilities. This doesn't
     necessarily occur when you open documents from other foreign formats.

2. Word's internal Rich Text Format (RTF) reader then interprets the RTF code
  provided by the converter. While interpreting the RTF, Word's internal RTF
  reader may remap the font again if the font information supplied by the
  converter does not match those fonts actually available under Windows.

  Once you open a document in Word, in most cases, the font name from the
  original application is displayed on the formatting toolbar, and the
  substituted Windows font is applied for actual display and printing.

  The original font is retained and displayed on the formatting toolbar to
  enable round-trip conversion back to the original format.

Selecting to Modify Substitutions Following Conversion
------------------------------------------------------

If a foreign document contains one or more fonts that do not exist under Windows,
you can view the current substitutions for these fonts by selecting the Font
Substitution button on the Compatibility tab (on the Tools menu, click
Options).

If all fonts used in the foreign document are available under Windows, you cannot
open the Font Substitution dialog box, and you will receive the following
message if you click Font Substitution:

  No font substitution is necessary. All fonts used in this document are
  available.

If you are not allowed to open the font substitution dialog box, you can still
substitute fonts by using Word's Replace command to replace the font name that
appears on the formatting ruler with an available font of your choice.

Modifying Substitutions in the Font Substitution Dialog Box
-----------------------------------------------------------

A font from a foreign document that is not available under is displayed as a
"Missing Document Font." The "Substituted Font" is the font the converter and
Word have chosen to replace the "missing" font for actual display and printing.

If the substituted default is displayed as "Default," look at the bottom of the
dialog box for a description of the actual Windows font to which "Default"
refers.

You can change the current font substitution if that font doesn't meet your
needs. If you click OK, your change is reflected in the current document. If you
select the Convert Permanently option, your change is written to the
Msfntmap.ini file in your Windows folder, and the change remains in affect
during all future document conversions.

NOTE: If you don't want Word to display (on the formatting toolbar and in the
Format Character dialog box) the original font name from the source program
under which a document was created, use the Convert Permanently option to
permanently change the source font name to the substituted name on the
formatting toolbar.

Additional Information
----------------------

- Not all import converters available for use with Word support font
  conversion. Those that do support font-mapping include the WordPerfect, Word
  for MS-DOS, Windows Write, and RFT-DCA converters.

  Other import converters, such as the WordStar, MultiMate, Microsoft Excel, and
  Lotus 1-2-3 converters map all fonts to Courier or Courier New.

- If a PostScript printer driver is active, the WordPerfect 5.x converter
  always maps a fixed-width font (such as Courier 10 cpi or Letter Gothic) to
  the Courier printer font because this font is scaleable on a PostScript
  printer. If a non-PostScript printer is active, the converter instead maps
  fixed-width fonts to Courier New. You cannot access the font substitution
  Word makes in either case.

- When a converter passes RTF to Word, the original source font name is defined
  in the RTF font table following the \fN control word (where N is the RTF font
  number). The font that the converter believes should be substituted for the
  original font for display and printing is defined following the \falt
  (alternative font name) control. The \fN and \falt control and coinciding
  font names appear contiguously in RTF.

- Due to the large and ever-increasing number of fonts available for use with
  Word and other applications, there is no way that a converter can anticipate
  and know how to map all fonts. Word's converters that do support font-mapping
  strive to intelligently map the most common PCL and PostScript fonts.

- Some WordPerfect font names may also include font sizes. To retain overall
  document layout, the WordPerfect converter may in some instances slightly
  change the font size during conversion. Therefore, because Word displays the
  font name from WordPerfect on the formatting toolbar, you may experience a
  situation where the font size in the font name doesn't match the actual font
  size applied in Word. For example, "Fontname 12cpi" may appear in the Font
  box, whereas 9.5 might appear in the size box.
