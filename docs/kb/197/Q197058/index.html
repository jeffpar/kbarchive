The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0 will, in certain circumstances, fail to return a
non-delivery report (NDR) if a message encounters a message size limit on the
remote server's message transfer agent (MTA). The end result is that the user
will be unaware that their message has failed to be delivered.

The following events will be seen in the Windows NT Application Event log and
Exchange Server EV0.log:

  Event ID: 141
  Source: MSExchangeMTA
  Type: Warning
  Category: X.400 Service
  Description: The MTA is unable to route a report for message MTA object
  at fault: 0600004F. Check the routing table for a possible incorrect
  routing configuration. [MTA DISP:RESULT 22 136] (12)

  Event ID: 62
  Source: MSExchangeMTA
  Type: Warning
  Category: X.400 Service
  Description: A delivery failure occurred for the message with message
  transfer service identifier C=;A=;P=;L=. X.400 reason code
  unable-to-transfer. Diagnostic content-too-long. Contact Microsoft
  Product Support Services. [0 MTA DISP:RESULT 22 136] (12)

  Event ID: 290
  Source: MSExchangeMTA
  Type: Warning
  Category: X.400 Service
  Description: A non-delivery report (reason code unable-to-transfer and
  diagnostic code content-too-long) is being generated for message
  C=;A=;P=;L=. It was originally destined for DN:/o=/ou=/cn=/cn=
  recipient number 1), and was to be redirected to . [MTA DISP:RESULT 22
  136] (12)

CAUSE
=====

If an administrator places differing size restrictions on Exchange Server MTAs,
then messages with a size between the limits will be lost when sent to the more
restrictive server. The messages do not get delivered and although an NDR is
generated it also does not get delivered.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. If you are not severely affected by this
specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.0 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information on support costs, please go to the following
