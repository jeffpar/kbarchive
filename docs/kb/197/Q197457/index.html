SUMMARY
=======

ATSWeb, the web-centric Anomaly Tracking System version 2.0, is a database
application designed to track issues during team development of software. ATSWeb
allows developers, designers, and testers to view active issues, review the
history of an issue, and record the resolution of issues while developing
applications. Issues can be bugs in the code, inconsistencies between the
product and the specification, or future wish-list features.

WARNING: ANY USE BY YOU OF ATSWEB IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. Microsoft provides the
utility "as is" without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied,
including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or
fitness for a particular purpose. Use by you of the utility is not supported by
Microsoft Product Support Services (or Microsoft Product Support Services
Support Professionals).

NOTE: This tool is for tracking development issues related to your application.
This tool is not for reporting issues to Microsoft Corporation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can do the following with ATSWeb:

- Collect, organize, sort, and view reported issues.

- Easily add new issues, find a specific issue, and print issues.

- Filter the database to view only those issues that contain characteristics
  you specify, such as a specific version, priority, or platform.

- Store future feature requests for a product.

- Easily provide or extract information you need about a project, whether you
  are a developer, manager, tester, or other team member.

- Store the complete history of each issue, including the issue's status and
  all actions taken on the issue.

- Enable offline review and editing of issues and later synchronization with
  the server.

The ATSWeb application consists of two components: the server side components and
the client side components. You can find out more information about ATSWeb in
the ATSWeb Readme.txt file.

The source code for the Visual FoxPro COM component portions of ATSWeb is
released with the ATSWeb application. You can download both the application and
source code from the following Web site:
