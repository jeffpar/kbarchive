SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use aircraft from Flight Shop and Microsoft Flight
Simulator in Combat Flight Simulator.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Imported Flight Simulator 98 aircraft and converted Flight Shop or Flight
Simulator 5.1 or 6.0 aircraft use a default damage profile file (Default.dp)
that provides generic weapons placement.

Microsoft does not support making changes to the Default.dp file.

NOTE: Microsoft does not support the Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator Converter
(Cfsconv.exe) included with Combat Flight Simulator, aircraft converted using
the Combat Flight Simulator Converter, or the use of third-party aircraft in
Combat Flight Simulator.

If a converted third-party aircraft does not work in Combat Flight Simulator,
please contact the software manufacturer of the aircraft for support.

To use aircraft from Flight Shop, Flight Simulator 5.1, or Flight Simulator 6.0
for Windows 95 in Combat Flight Simulator, you must use the Microsoft Flight
Simulator Converter tool (Cfsconv.exe) to convert the aircraft to a format that
is compatible with Combat Flight Simulator.

To use aircraft from Flight Simulator 98 in Combat Flight Simulator, copy the
folder and files for the aircraft into the Combat Flight Simulator\Aircraft
folder.

To convert or import aircraft from Flight Shop or Flight Simulator, use the
appropriate method for the version of the aircraft that you want to use.

Flight Shop and Flight Simulator 5.1/6.0 Aircraft
-------------------------------------------------

To convert aircraft from Flight Shop, Flight Simulator 5.1, or Flight Simulator
6.0 (95) for use in Combat Flight Simulator:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type the following line, and then click OK

  &lt;drive&gt;:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Combat Flight Simulator\Aircraft

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter of the hard disk on which Combat
  Flight Simulator is installed.

3. On the File menu, point to New, and then click Folder.

4. Type "Convert" (without the quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

5. Copy the Flight Shop or Flight Simulator aircraft files that you want to use
  into the Convert folder.

6. Click Start, and then click Run.

7. In the Open box, type the following line, and then click OK

  &lt;drive&gt;:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Combat Flight
  Simulator\Cfsconv.exe

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter of the hard disk on which Combat
  Flight Simulator is installed.

8. Click Options.

9. In the Default Aircraft Input Directory box, type the path to the folder that
  contains the copies of the aircraft files that you want to convert, and then
  click OK.

10. Click Convert Aircraft Files.

11. Click to select the aircraft that you want to convert. To select multiple
  aircraft, press and hold down the CTRL key as you click to select each
  additional aircraft.

12. Click Open.

13. Click Close, and then click Exit to quit Microsoft Flight Simulator
  Converter.

To fly your converted Flight Shop, Flight Simulator 5.1, or Flight Simulator 6.0
aircraft in Combat Flight Simulator, click the aircraft that you want to fly in
the Aircraft box on the Free Flight or Mission Briefing screen.

NOTE: Combat Flight Simulator supports multi-engine instrument panels in
converted multi-engine aircraft so you can see the instrumentation for all
engines in the aircraft at once.

To view a multi-engine instrument panel for a converted aircraft, point to
Instrument Panel on the Views menu, and then click the panel that you want to
see, or press SHIFT+&lt;number&gt;, where &lt;number&gt; is the number
associated with that instrument panel. To view the multi-engine instrument panel
of a converted aircraft based on the Cessna or Lear template, press SHIFT+5. To
view the multi-engine instrument panel for a converted aircraft based on the 737
template, press SHIFT+6.
