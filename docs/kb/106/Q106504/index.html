-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, on platform(s):
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

Previously, when you used the SNA Server Windows 3.x client to communicate to
the server over TCP/IP sockets, Netware IPX/SPX, or Banyan IP, you were not able
to change your Windows NT password if the password had expired on the Windows NT
Server.

Support for SNA Server Windows 3.x clients to change their expired Windows NT
password has been added in SNA Server 2.11 Service Pack 1. For this to work,
apply the Service Pack to the SNA Server 2.11 server and to the Windows 3.x
client. Also apply Service Pack 2 (or higher) to Windows NT 3.51 on the Primary
Domain Controller (PDC).

MORE INFORMATION
================

This enhancement to the SNA Server Win3x client now allows clients running
non-named pipes interface along with the SNA Server Win3x 2.11 client to have
the ability to change their expired password in the Windows NT Server domain.
This enhancement works across all protocol stacks that are able to use the SNA
Server Win3x client software to access the SNA Server.

This enhancement to the SNA Server Client is possible due to enhancements made in
NT 3.51 Service Pack 2. To make use of this feature, the Primary Domain
Controller (PDC) must be running Windows NT 3.51 with Service Pack 2 or later.
The SNA Server(s) do not necessarily need to be running at this level but it is
recommended.


STATUS
======

This feature is included in the latest U.S. Service Pack for SNA Server for
Windows NT, version 2.11. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query
on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the spaces):
