SUMMARY
=======

These are the answers to 20 of the most commonly asked questions about Microsoft
FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Q. When I attempt to build a project using the PowerStation Visual Workbench,
  I get an error dialog box that says:

  Internal error. Timed out waiting for "C:\F32\BIN\WINTEE.EXE" to start.
  Please contact Microsoft Product Support Services

  What can I do to correct this problem?

  A. The problem is probably caused by a Windows configuration setting that
  causes Windows-based applications to get 100 percent of the computer's
  processing time whenever a Windows-based application is active. This causes
  MS-DOS-based applications to fail to run whenever a Windows-based application
  is running. To correct the problem, from the Main program group, start the
  Control Panel application. Choose the "386 Enhanced" icon. Be sure that the
  Exclusive In Foreground check box is not checked. Choose OK to return from
  the dialog box, and close the Control Panel application. The problem should
  now be corrected.

2. Q. My PowerStation application writes data to a binary file. Why is the
  amount of data in the file less that what I expect?

  A. There is a problem with output to binary or unformatted files with FORTRAN
  PowerStation. If your code writes arrays larger than 64K in size to a binary
  or unformatted file and the array is specified in the output statement
  without using an implied DO-loop (or only a simple, single-dimension, implied
  DO-loop), then the amount of data that will be output to the file is the size
  of the array modulus 64K.

  To correct this problem, use an explicit implied DO-loop for the array in the
  input or output statement. The array index expression in the implied DO-loop
  must be more than a simple variable. For example, change "array sub i" to
  "array sub i plus zero." The functionality is the same but the more
  complicated expression causes the compiler to generate the correct code.

3. Q. When I use the PowerStation's Visual Workbench to compile and build
  programs, it takes a very long time to compile and link. What can I do to
  improve this process?

  A. The system requirements state that you must be running MS-DOS and need 4
  megabytes (MB) of available memory with 6 MB or more preferred. If you have
  only 4 MB of physical memory, then under Windows you probably have less than
  4 MB of physical memory available and are intensively using your Windows swap
  file. Make sure that your swap file is as large as it can be and that you are
  using a permanent swap file. You can also decrease the amount of memory that
  SMARTDRV or any other disc caching utility is consuming. The most effective
  solution is to add more physical memory to your machine.

4. Q. I used to do mixed-language programming with high-level languages (such as
  C) and FORTRAN. Can I do this with FORTRAN PowerStation?

  A. Yes. Object modules compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 32-bit edition, can
  be linked with FORTRAN PowerStation. For more details, please see the
  information in the F32\SAMPLES\MIXED_C directory. 16- bit C/C++ object
  modules (created by earlier versions of Microsoft C or Visual C++ 16-bit
  edition) can not be linked with 32-bit FORTRAN; these must be recompiled with
  a 32-bit compiler.

  For complete support of mixed 32-bit C and FORTRAN programming, Microsoft
  offers development tools for Windows NT: Visual C++ 32-bit edition and
  FORTRAN PowerStation 32 for Windows NT. Microsoft Windows NT is a true 32-bit
  operating system (in contrast to a 32-bit DOS extender on top of 16-bit
  MS-DOS) allowing full integration between the two languages. Mixing of C and
  FORTRAN is also possible in a pure 16-bit world, such as MS-DOS or Windows,
  with Microsoft FORTRAN 5.1 and Microsoft Visual C++ 16-bit edition.

5. Q. Can I do Windows executable or Windows dynamic-link library (DLL)
  programming using FORTRAN PowerStation?

  A. FORTRAN PowerStation for Windows creates only 32-bit MS-DOS- extended
  MS-DOS applications. FORTRAN PowerStation32 for Windows NT will create Win32
  executables and DLLs.

6. Q. I have some FORTRAN code that reads a file that used to work with
  Microsoft FORTRAN version 5.1. The code now gets an error when it is almost
  finished reading the file. What is the problem?

  A. Earlier versions of Microsoft FORTRAN had some limited support for
  end-of-file handling using the "CTRL+Z" character. This character, which is
  number 26 in the ASCII table, is placed in files by some editors and some
  other file creation utilities. FORTRAN PowerStation no longer treats this
  character as a special character and gives an error message when attempting
  to read it into a variable. Make sure that files being read by FORTRAN
  PowerStation programs do not contain this character, which resembles a small
  right-pointing arrow when displayed by editors capable of displaying all
  characters in a file. This was an unintended loss of functionality with the
  product and is under investigation.

7. Q. When I run my program on a machine with lots of memory I get no error. But
  when I run it on a machine with less memory I get the run-time error:

  DOSXMSF : fatal error DX1020: unhandled exception: Page fault

  A. This is an MS-DOS-extender error that indicates that the program attempted
  to access memory that was not owned or allocated by the program. A common
  cause of this error is an array subscript going out of the array's declared
  range. An attempt to access an array beyond the range of the array does not
  cause the DX1020 error to occur immediately. On machines with less physical
  memory (RAM), this error occurs more often because any attempt to access
  virtual memory on the disk will cause an initial nonexception page fault;
  however, if the request for memory is invalid, the DX1020 error will occur.
  Check the code carefully to be sure that all array access uses an array index
  within the proper range. Also, use the /4Yb compiler option to install some
  additional debug error checking. This can be set in the Visual Workbench by
  choosing Project from the Options menu and then choosing the Compiler button.
  Select the category Language Extensions and the option Extended Error
  Handling.

8. Q. When I use the PowerStation debugger under the Visual Workbench, it
  sometimes proceeds very slowly and occasionally acts erratically. What can I
  do to improve this situation?

  A. The system requirements for FORTRAN PowerStation states that the product
  requires 4 MB of available memory. This is an absolutely minimum requirement.
  Under Windows, the PowerStation tools may not perform optimally without an
  adequate amount of Windows swap file. Make sure that you have the largest
  Windows swap file that it is possible to have. The most effective way to
  improve performance of the PowerStation tools is to add physical memory (RAM)
  to your machine. For optimal performance while debugging make sure that you
  are not running any other applications. In particular, make sure that you are
  not running any other MS-DOS applications or MS-DOS prompts.

9. Q. My program runs for some time and then I see intensive disk access. It
  takes a long time to terminate or I see the error, "F6700 Heap Space Limit
  Exceeded."

  A. There is a known memory leak with the PowerStation product, which is caused
  by having a string concatenation inside of an IF statement. Assign the string
  concatenation to a intermediate variable and use that variable in the IF
  statement instead of the concatenation itself.

10. Q. I have some code that uses COMPLEX variables. Why aren't I getting the
  results I expect or why don't I get the results that I got under FORTRAN
  version 5.1?

  A. There are two known problems with COMPLEX variables that could result in
  incorrect results. The first problem is that logical expressions that
  compare COMPLEX variables for inequality can fail under some circumstances.
  These are expressions such as IF (Q.NE.Z) where both Q and Z are COMPLEX
  variables. If either the real or the imaginary elements are the same in both
  variables then the .NE. will fail to detect that the other elements are
  different and will return .FALSE. To avoid this problem, use the logical
  equivalent to .NE. of .NOT.(Q.EQ.Z).

  The second problem occurs if a REAL function, including the FORTRAN intrinsic
  functions, is assigned to a COMPLEX variable. To resolve this problem,
  assign the REAL function to a REAL intermediate variable and then assign
  that variable to the COMPLEX variable.

11. Q. I get linker errors that start with LNK. Where can I find more
  information about these errors?

  A. The LINK32 errors are available in the ERRORS.HLP Windows Help file and in
  the ERRORS.TXT ASCII text file. Access to ERRORS.HLP is available only from
  Windows. You can bring up this file from the Visual Workbench by selecting
  the Help menu and choosing Search For Help On. Type in "errors" in the Help
  Keyword text field and then choose OK. You can also access the file by
  opening the File Manager and double-clicking the ERRORS.HLP file in the
  \F32\HELP directory.

  The ERRORS.TXT file is in the F32\README directory. It can be read or printed
  from MS-DOS or Windows like any other text file.

12. Q. I am getting some errors that begin with DX. Where can I get more
  information on these errors?

  A. The DX errors are Phar Lap DOS-extender errors and are available in the
  ERRORS.HLP Windows Help file and in the ERRORS.TXT ASCII text file. Access
  to ERRORS.HLP is available only from Windows. You can bring up this file
  from the Visual Workbench by selecting the Help menu and choosing Search For
  Help On. Type in "errors" in the Help Keyword text field and then choose OK.
  You can also access the file by opening the File Manager and double-clicking
  the ERRORS.HLP file in the \F32\HELP directory.

  The ERRORS.TXT file is in the F32\README directory. It can be read or printed
  from MS-DOS or Windows like any other text file.

13. Q. In FORTRAN version 5.1 there is an option, /Fs, to create a source
  listing file. Can I do this with PowerStation?

  A. No, the PowerStation product does not support the source listing option.
  Most of the functionality of source listings is available though different
  options in the Visual Workbench. Source browser information, for example,
  provides a visual means of locating variable definitions and references.

14. Q. I created a project with the PowerStation Visual Workbench and several of
  my source files have include statements. When I modify one of these include
  files and then build the project, the source file does not recompile. Why
  isn't there a build dependency for the include files?

  A. You are probably using the $INCLUDE metacommand and not the INCLUDE
  statement in your source files. The Visual Workbench build engine does not
  create dependencies for files on $INCLUDE metacommands. Change all the
  metacommands to FORTRAN statements and then force the project to rescan
  dependencies by selecting Project and then choosing Scan All Dependencies.

15. Q. I am getting the following error:

  LINK32 : error LNK2133: Size mismatch for symbol and the symbol listed in the
  error is the name of one of my COMMON blocks.

  What is causing this error?

  A. You probably have a COMMON block declared with arrays of different sizes
  in different source files. In one source file you are initializing the
  COMMON block with a DATA statement. You must have the object file from the
  source file that initializes the data in the COMMON block in the link
  command before any other object file from a source file that references the
  COMMON block. Moving the object files in the link order will prevent the
  error from occurring. If you are using a Visual Workbench project, change
  the filename of the source file that initializes the COMMON block to a name
  that is alphabetically prior to all other source filenames. This will force
  the build to include the object file first on the link command line.

16. Q. Sometimes when I start up the PowerStation Visual Workbench I can't see
  some of the windows I had set up when I closed it; they are listed in the
  Windows menu, but I can't see or access them. What happened and how can I
  see my windows again?

  A. You probably had the inaccessible child windows minimized within the
  Visual Workbench frame and then closed the Visual Workbench while it was
  itself minimized. This can easily happen if you exit Windows when the Visual
  Workbench is still active and minimized. To avoid this problem, never exit
  the Visual Workbench application when it is in a minimized state when the
  Visual Workbench still active. You can make any inaccessible child windows
  visible by selecting the Window menu and choosing Cascade.

17. Q. When I try to use the PowerStation Visual Workbench browser I get the
  error:

  Cannot open the browser database file. Share is not installed or is not
  active for this drive.

  How can I avoid this error?

  A. The Visual Workbench browse utility requires that SHARE.EXE, an MS-DOS
  file access arbitration utility, is installed prior to starting Windows. The
  easiest way to do this is put the statement "C:\DOS\SHARE" in your
  AUTOEXEC.BAT file. Make sure that you put the SHARE command before any line
  in the AUTOEXEC.BAT that says "win" or "dosshell."

18. Q. How does virtual memory work under the PowerStation product? Is there any
  way I can change this functionality?

  A. PowerStation virtual memory management is considerably different depending
  on whether you are running your application under MS-DOS or under MS-DOS
  under Windows.

  If you run your PowerStation application under MS-DOS, virtual memory is
  managed by the Phar Lap DOS-extender. When your application loads into
  memory, all declared data must load into memory. If you don't have
  sufficient available extended memory, the DOS-extender will use virtual
  memory on the disk where DOSXMSF.EXE is located. This process is automatic
  and requires no interaction on the part of the program. If you want to
  relocate the location used for virtual memory, you can set the DOSX
  environment variable with the command:

  SET DOSX=-SWAPDIR X:\MYSWAP

  Note that X: is the drive/partition you want to use and MYSWAP is the
  directory you want to place the virtual memory file in. If you want to turn
  off use of virtual memory, you can set the DOSX environment variable as
  follows:

  SET DOSX=-NOVM

  If you are running your program under an MS-DOS session under Windows, then
  virtual memory is managed by Windows. You can control the size and type of
  your Windows swap file by starting the Control Panel application and
  selecting the 386 Enhanced icon. Please consult your Windows documentation
  for further details.

19. Q. I am compiling and linking in two separate steps from the command-line.
  When I go to run the executable file I get the error:

  This program cannot be run in DOS mode.

  What did I do wrong?

  A. PowerStation applications use an MS-DOS-extender so there is an additional
  step required to allow the executable to run under MS-DOS. You need to run
  the BINDMSF.EXE utility on your executable to install a small piece of code
  called a "stub-loader." For example, if you had an executable file called
  MYEXE.EXE, you would use the command line:

  BINDMSF MYEXE.EXE

20. Q. Can I run the PowerStation product under OS/2?

  A. No, FORTRAN PowerStation does not run under or target OS/2 or the
  MS-DOS-compatibility session under OS/2. Under the MS-DOS- compatibility
  session, the MS-DOS-extender has a problem that prevents it from working
  correctly.
