FONT ASSISTANT
--------------

A. Limitations on groups and group names
----------------------------------------

  Font Assistant will allow you to create up to 63 groups. Group names must not
  exceed 32 characters or contain a double-quote character ("). If you use the
  FAST.BIN file shipped with Word Assistant, the permanent groups count as part
  of the 63 groups. You can delete some or all of the permanent groups to allow
  for the creation of the 63 groups.

B. Font Assistant and the Control Panel
---------------------------------------

  While the Fonts dialog box from the Control Panel is open, do not activate or
  deactivate font groups in Font Assistant. Close the Fonts dialog box from
  Control Panel before changing the active font groups on your system in Font
  Assistant. Failing to follow this advice can cause the two applications to
  get differing views of the active fonts on your system.

C. Predefined font groups in Font Assistant

-------------------------------------------

  Font Assistant includes predefined font groups that include all the font
  products previously released by Microsoft. Grouping fonts reflects personal
  choices, so consider the predefined groups as suggestions only. You can
  always add or delete fonts from any predefined group except the &lt;all
  fonts&gt; group.

  To review the fonts in any group, highlight the group in the Fonts Group(s)
  list. The Samples area to the right of the list will display a one-line
  sample of each font in the highlighted group.

D. Restoring predefined groups
------------------------------

  If you modify the predefined groups, you can always restore the original
  groups.

  To restore the predefined font groups, choose Restore Default Group from the
  file menu.

  Be aware that restoring the defaults will erase any font groups you created.
  If you want any of those groups, you'll have to recreate them.

E. Rebuilding the FAST.INI file

-------------------------------

  The FAST.INI file is Font Assistant's database of information about the fonts
  installed on your system. This database can become inconsistent with the
  installed fonts, especially if you use the Control Panel to add, delete, or
  otherwise change the fonts on your system while Font Assistant is running.
  For example, installed fonts may fail to appear in the &lt;all fonts&gt;
  group, and deleted fonts may still appear in font groups.

  In the unlikely event that this happens, delete your FAST.BIN file from the
  Windows directory. Choose to install Font Assistant from Word Assistant
  setup. You will have to recreate any font groups you created from scratch.

F. Display and Printing of Fonts

--------------------------------

  If you use many fonts on your system, Windows might run out of system
  resources required to display those characters. When this occurs, you might
  see a rectangular box or blank in place of the character.

  To correct this problem, close some of your open applications to free
  resources for Windows. If this doesn't work, you may have to restart Windows.
