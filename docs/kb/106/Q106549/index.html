SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to play a compressed sound clip on a computer using a Creative
Labs Sound Blaster 16 or Sound Blaster 16 ASP, or a Media Vision or Jazz sound
card in Sound Blaster emulation mode, you may experience one or more of the
following symptoms:

- The sound clip stutters during playback.
- You hear loud static instead of the sound clip.
- You do not hear any sound.
- The sound clip playback is twice as fast as normal.
- The computer stops responding (hangs).
- Microsoft Windows abruptly quits to the MS-DOS prompt.
- You receive an error message similar to one of the following error messages:

  General Protection Fault
  No ROM Basic
  Memory Parity Error
  Segment Load Failure


In addition, you may not be able to play a sound clip in Dinosaurs, but you are
able to play video clips, you may not be able to play pronunciations in
Bookshelf and Encarta, and you may not be able to play sound clips in Musical
Instruments.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if your computer cannot properly use the 16-bit Direct
Memory Access (DMA) channel on the Sound Blaster 16 or Sound Blaster 16 ASP
sound card.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, change the sound card settings to use single-mode DMA. To
do so, use the appropriate method for your version of Microsoft Windows and your
version of the Sound Blaster drivers.

NOTE: When you disable 16-bit DMA, you do not reduce the quality of sound
playback or disable playback of 16-bit sound clips


Windows 95/98 Drivers
---------------------

For information about how to change Sound Blaster 16 DMA settings on a Microsoft
Windows 95/98-based computer running Windows 95/98 sound drivers, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q136675 Changing SoundBlaster 16 HDMA Setting in Windows 95

Windows 3.1x Drivers
--------------------

For information about how to change Sound Blaster 16 DMA settings on a Microsoft
Windows 3.1x-based computer running the Sound Blaster version 3.02 or later
sound driver, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q124869 Software Reconfiguration of SoundBlaster 16 Hardware Settings

If the version of the Sound Blaster driver on your computer is less than 3.02,
contact Creative Labs to obtain the latest version of the Sound Blaster 16 sound
driver for Windows 3.1x.

Older Windows 3.x Drivers
-------------------------

To change Sound Blaster 16 DMA settings on a Windows 3.1x-based computer running
an older version of the Sound Blaster sound driver, follow these steps:

Change the DMA settings in each of the following locations:

- The Drivers dialog box in the Windows Control Panel
- The Sbconfig.exe configuration program included with the Sound Blaster cards

To change the settings, do the following:

1. In the Main Group in Program Manager, double-click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Drivers.

3. Double-click the Sound Blaster 16 Wave/Midi driver.

4. Under the HDMA option, click Use DMA.

5. Click OK, and then click Do Not Restart Windows Now.

6. Close Control Panel.

7. On the File menu in Program Manager, click Exit Windows.

8. At the MS-DOS prompt, type "cd\sb16" (without the quotation marks), and then
  press ENTER.

9. At the MS-DOS prompt, type "sbconfig.exe" (without the quotation marks), and
  then press ENTER.

10. Follow the instructions on the screen to configure and test the following
  settings:

  +----------------------------------+
  | Setting          | Value         | 
  +----------------------------------+
  | Base I/O port    | Autoscan      | 
  +----------------------------------+
  | MidiPort address | Autoscan      | 
  +----------------------------------+
  | DMA interrupt    | Current       | 
  +----------------------------------+
  | 8-bit DMA        | Current       | 
  +----------------------------------+
  | 16-bit DMA       | Use 8-bit DMA | 
  +----------------------------------+

  When you finish making these changes, the Sbconfig program restarts your
  computer.

  NOTE: For more information about how to use the Sbconfg.exe program, please
  see your Sound Blaster 16 user's manual.

Manually Changing Sound Blaster DMA Settings
--------------------------------------------

To manually change the Sound Blaster DMA settings on a Windows 3.1x-based
computer, follow these steps:

1. On the File menu in Program Manager, click Run.

2. In the Command Line box, type "sysedit" (without the quotation marks), and
  then click OK.

3. In the Autoexec.bat window, change the value of the H parameter on the Set
  Blaster line to match the value of the D parameter.

4. If you use a Sound Blaster 16 or Sound Blaster 16 ASP card, follow these
  steps:

  a. In the Config.sys window, change the value of the H parameter on the
     Device=C:\Sb16\Ctsb16.sys line to match the value of the D parameter.

  b. In the System.ini window, change the value of the HDMAChannel= line in the
     [Sndblst.drv] section to match the value of the DMAChannel= line.

5. If you use a Media Vision sound card configured to emulate a Sound Blaster 16
  sound card, follow these steps:

  a. In the Config.sys window, change the value of the H parameter on the
     Device=C:\&lt;folder&gt;\Mvsound.sys line to match the value of the D
     parameter, where &lt;folder&gt; is the folder in which the Mvsound.sys
     file is located. Typically, this is the Proaudio, Mvision, Prostudio, or
     Proas folder.

  b. In the System.ini window, change the value of the HDMAChannel= line in the
     [MVPROAUD.DRV] to match the value of the DMAChannel= line.

6. If you use a Jazz sound card configured to emulated a Sound Blaster 16 sound
  card, follow these steps:

  a. In the System.ini window, modify the value of the DMAChannel2= line in the
     [Jazz.drv] section to match the value of the DMAChannel1= line.

  b. In the Config.sys window, change the value of the E parameter on the
     Device=C:\&lt;folder&gt;\Jazz.sys line to match the value of the D
     parameter, where &lt;folder&gt; is the folder in which the Jazz.sys file
     is located.

7. On the File menu, click Exit.

8. When you are prompted to save changes, click Yes.

9. Restart the computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This issue only occurs when you run a program that uses compressed sound.
Because of the complicated use of memory that occurs when the computer
decompresses a sound clip at the same time that it plays it. Many multimedia
programs attempt to play a compressed audio clip when you start them.

The Sound Blaster 16 or Sound Blaster 16 ASP sound cards use two Direct Memory
Access (DMA) channels: one for 8-bit memory access and one for 16- bit memory
access.

Sound Blaster 16 sound cards can use the following DMA settings:

- 8-bit (DMA): 0, 1, 2, or 3
- 16-bit (HDMA): 5, 6, or 7
