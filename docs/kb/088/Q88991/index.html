SUMMARY
=======

1. Q. I am receiving the error message "subscript out of range." What is causing
  this problem?

  A. In the Microsoft Visual Basic for MS-DOS (VBDOS) environment and in a
  compiled application, a "subscript out of range" error message may occur on a
  dimension (DIM) statement. This error is usually caused by one or both of the
  following conditions:

  a. If you have an array whose total size is greater than 64K, you must use
     the /ah switch. To compile an application, add the /ah switch to your
     command line. To use the /ah switch in the VBDOS environment, add /ah to
     the command line when you invoke VBDOS.EXE.

  b. Also, if you are working with a huge array (that is, over 128K), the
     length of each element of the array must be a power of 2 bytes (2, 4, 8,
     16, 32, 64, and so on). Frequently this is not the case with arrays of
     user-defined types and arrays of fixed-length strings. If an element of a
     huge array is not a power of 2 bytes, the user-defined type or fixed-
     length string must be increased to the nearest power of 2. For example, an
     array of fixed-length strings where each string is 60 bytes long must be
     changed to an array of fixed- length strings where each string is 64 bytes
     long.

2. Q. I am running out of memory in the VBDOS environment. What can I do to help
  alleviate this problem?

  A. When you are running in the VBDOS environment, it is best to have as much
  expanded memory available as possible. VBDOS.EXE stores subprograms and
  functions of less than 16K of code in expanded memory. To make more
  conventional memory available, VBDOS provides an /s switch to reduce the
  amount of conventional memory used by VBDOS.EXE. For example, you can start
  VBDOS.EXE by typing "vbdos /s:340" (without the quotation marks) at the
  command line. We recommend that you start VBDOS.EXE with an /s value between
  320 and 350. This provides a good compromise between available memory and
  speed. The lower the /s value, the slower the environment runs.

  Running out of DGROUP or conventional memory is the most common cause of "out
  of memory" messages in the VBDOS environment. Possible reasons for running
  out of DGROUP include the following:

  a. Too many subroutines or functions: Each SUB or FUNCTION procedure uses 46
     bytes of DGROUP in the environment. Remove all routines that are not being
     called or used.

  b. Static arrays: Static arrays are stored in DGROUP. The only way to have a
     static array in VBDOS.EXE is to have a dimension (DIM) statement for a
     common shared array before the COMMON SHARED statement that contains it.
     By positioning the DIM statement after the COMMON SHARED statement, the
     array becomes dynamic and therefore is not stored in DGROUP.

  c. Variable overhead: There is a 4-byte overhead in DGROUP for each variable.
     This overhead occurs for each module. Therefore, in a multiple-module
     program that has many common shared variables, this overhead is duplicated
     for each module you have. To reduce the overhead, reduce the number of
     variables and modules.

  For more information on memory management, please refer to Appendix B of the
  "Programmer's Guide." Please note that the README.DOC file provided with
  Visual Basic for MS-DOS contains some corrections to this appendix.

  Possible reasons for running out of conventional memory include the
  following:

  a. Not enough expanded memory for all your Basic routines: To work around
     this problem, you must increase the amount of expanded memory available to
     your program.

  b. Subroutine or functions that are over 16K: To work around this problem,
     decrease the size of each SUB or FUNCTION procedure until it is less than
     16K. The size of each routine can be determined by pressing F2 in the
     environment.

  c. Large arrays: To work around this problem, decrease the number of
     dimensions in your arrays. Nonvariable-length- string arrays of less than
     16K can be stored in expanded memory by using the /ea switch when you
     invoke VBDOS.EXE and Quick libraries. Your Quick library should include
     only the routines that you need.

  For more information on memory management, please refer to Appendix B of the
  "Programmer's Guide." Please note that the README.DOC file provided with
  Visual Basic for MS-DOS contains some corrections to this appendix.

3. Q. My program runs in the VBDOS environment; however, when the program is
  compiled, an "out of memory" message is generated. How can I correct this
  problem?

  A. If a program runs successfully in the VBDOS environment but runs out of
  memory at compile time or run time, there may be a problem with arrays. In
  the VBDOS environment, arrays are dynamic by default. This means that the
  arrays are created at run time and are stored in far memory. In a compiled
  application, arrays are static by default. This means the arrays are created
  at compile time and are stored in near memory (DGROUP), of which there is
  only 64K.

  To make all your arrays dynamic in a compiled application, use the metacommand
  REM $DYNAMIC at the beginning of your program before the dimension (DIM)
  statements of your arrays. If you have any arrays that are included in COMMON
  SHARED statements, The DIM statements for these arrays should come after the
  COMMON SHARED statements in which they are included.

  For more information on the $DYNAMIC metacommand, please refer to the "A-Z
  Reference" in the "Reference" manual.

  For more information on memory management, please refer to Appendix B of the
  "Programmer's Guide."

4. Q. When I try to compile my program, I receive a "program memory overflow"
  error message. How can I correct this problem?

  A. If a program runs successfully in the VBDOS environment but generates a
  "program memory overflow" error message at compile time, the program needs to
  be broken down into multiple modules.

  In the VBDOS environment, each subroutine, function, event, or module-level
  code is allocated 64K for code. In a compiled application, the entire file is
  allocated only 64K. This difference allows a much larger code module or form
  run in the environment than can run in a compiled application.

  To make your compiled programs run, you must reduce them in size by moving
  some code to another module. For more information on multiple-module
  programming, please refer to Chapters 6 and 16 of the "Programmer's Guide."
