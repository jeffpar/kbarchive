MORE INFORMATION
================

Sigma Models and Specific Model Issues
--------------------------------------

LaserView Monochrome or LaserView Classic

This monitor supports 1600 x 1200 pixel resolution. The Windows 3.1 drivers for
this card may display the Windows 3.0 logo when Windows is started. If this is a
problem, contact Sigma for updated drivers that correct this problem.

This card uses two upper memory areas (UMA) B000-BFFF and D000-DFFF. The base I/O
address for this card is located at 249 hexadecimal.


PageView and SilverView Monochrome, and VGA Legend

Microsoft has no information about PageView Monochrome and SilverView Monochrome
having any problems with Windows. However, when running Windows 3.1 in enhanced
mode with the VGA Legend, black and white rectangles may appear on the screen.
(Alternative symptoms are brown and tan colored bands obscuring all Windows
features.)

To resolve this problem, insert the following line in the [386enh] section of the
SYSTEM.INI:

  sysvmin2ndbank=false


Sigma/H

This is an earlier Sigma EGA or VGA card, which is not compatible with Windows.
Contact Sigma and have your card upgraded to the Sigma Legend.

NOTE: Many Sigma cards come in both Micro channel (MCA) and ISA bus interfaces.
If you are using the MCA version of the card, make sure you are using the PS/2
drivers, instead of the Windows 3.0 drivers.

Driver Installation
-------------------

1. Exit Windows, and change your directory to C:\WINDOWS.

2. Type "setup" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER.

3. From the hardware options screen, choose Display.

4. Choose Other, and insert the Sigma driver disk.

The Sigma Designs products included here are manufactured by a vendor independent
of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.
