SUMMARY
=======

You can use the following methods to leave the routine specified in an ON ERROR
command:

- Use the RETURN TO MASTER command to return to the highest level program. For
  example, if the Run menu pad is present on the FoxPro system menu bar
  (FOXSTART.APP was executed on startup), the RETURN TO MASTER command returns
  control to FOXSTART.APP.

- Use the RETURN command to return to the program that had the error and
  continue execution on the next line. For example, the RETURN command
  terminates execution of a program or a user-defined function (UDF) and
  returns control to either the calling program, the highest level calling
  program, another program, or the Command window.

  Using a RETURN command at the end of a program or a user-defined function is
  optional because an implicit RETURN command automatically follows the last
  statement in a program file. Private memory variables are released when the
  RETURN command is executed.

- Use the RETRY command to return to the program that had the error and execute
  the line that had the error. For example, the RETRY command returns control
  to the calling program and reexecutes the last line that was executed in that
  program. The RETRY command is similar to the RETURN command except that the
  RETURN command causes the next line in the calling program to be executed
  rather than reexecuting the most recently executed line. RETRY is especially
  useful in error-handling routines or when a set of commands should be
  repeated until a certain condition is true.

  In FoxPro/LAN (the networked version of FoxPro), the RETRY command is
  frequently used to repeat a command until a record or file becomes available
  for use. The SET REPROCESS command can be used to control the number of times
  a command is repeated when it is unable to access a record or a file. In most
  network situations, the SET REPROCESS command is preferred.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The ON ERROR command traps errors that occur during program execution. When an
error occurs, the trap is triggered and the specified command is executed. An ON
ERROR routine may be deactivated by issuing another ON ERROR command that does
not specify a command to run.

If the command specified in the ON ERROR command is DO &lt;program&gt;,
specifying the ERROR(), LINENO(), MESSAGE(), and PROGRAM() functions as
parameters passes the cause of the error, the line number where the error
occurred, the error message, and the name of the program that had the error to
the error handling function. This information can be valuable during the process
of debugging an application.

After the ON ERROR routine completes, program execution resumes on the line
immediately following the line that causes the error. However, if the specified
command is DO &lt;program&gt; and the &lt;program&gt; ends with a RETRY command,
execution resumes on the line on which the error occurred.

In FoxPro/LAN, an ON ERROR routine may be used to trap for errors created when a
command that attempts to lock a record or a file is unsuccessful. If an ON ERROR
routine is not in effect, FoxPro displays an error message that indicates why
the record lock or file lock is unsuccessful (for example, "Record is in use by
another"). If an ON ERROR routine is in effect, FoxPro does not display an error
message and it executes the ON ERROR routine. Note that an unsuccessful lock
attempt by the explicit locking functions [FLOCK(), LOCK(), and RLOCK()] does
not trigger an ON ERROR routine or cause an error message to be displayed.
Instead, these functions return a logical truth value (.F. or .T.) to indicate
the failure or success of the lock attempt.

Sample Code
-----------

     ON ERROR DO errhand WITH ;
        ERROR(), MESSAGE(), MESSAGE(1), PROGRAM(), LINENO()

     *** The next line should cause an error. ***

     USE nodatabase

     PROCEDURE errhand
     PARAMETER merror, mess, mess1, mprog, mlineno
     ? 'Error number: ' + LTRIM(STR(merror))
     ? 'Error message: ' + mess
     ? 'Line of code with error: ' + mess1
     ? 'Line number of error: ' + LTRIM(STR(mlineno))
     ? 'Program with error: ' + mprog
