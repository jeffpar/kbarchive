-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The CalComp Wiz Mouse requires a special driver to work properly with Windows.
If you use the CalComp Wiz Mouse with any of the mouse drivers that ship with
Windows, you may experience slow hard disk access time (for example, 3 to 5
minutes to load Microsoft Excel) or programs may return to an MS-DOS Prompt
unexpectedly.

MORE INFORMATION
================

CalComp technical support has confirmed that the CalComp Wiz Mouse does not work
properly with any mouse drivers supplied with Windows. They have developed and
tested a mouse driver for use with Windows 3.0 and 3.0a. This driver will also
allow you to use the Wiz Mouse with Windows 3.1, but is not 100-percent
compatible. CalComp is currently developing a new driver for use with Windows
3.1.

WORKAROUND
==========

According to CalComp, the following temporary workaround allows the Wiz Mouse to
be used with Windows 3.0 until you can obtain the CalComp driver:

1. From Windows Setup, install the Mouse Systems serial mouse on either your
  COM1 or COM2 driver.

2. Using a text editor, insert the following two lines in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
  file:

        mode comx: 9600,n,8,1

  (where comx = com1, com2, com3..)

        echo 2 m&gt;comx:

  (where comx = com1, com2, com3..)

3. Restart the computer.

Obtaining the CalComp Driver
----------------------------

To obtain the Wiz Mouse driver for Windows 3.0 and 3.0a, call CalComp technical
support or call the CalComp BBS. The driver for Windows is WIZ11D- W.ZIP and the
driver for MS-DOS is WIZ11D-D.ZIP.

Once downloaded, these files must be unzipped and the files WIZ-DRV1.DRV and
WIZ-DRV2.DRV should be copied to the WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory.

To install the Wiz Mouse Windows drivers, use a text editor such as Notepad to
change the following lines in the SYSTEM.INI file:

     [Boot]
     mouse.drv=wiz-drv1.drv

(for mouse on Com1)

  -or-

     mouse.drv=wiz-drv2.drv

(for mouse on Com2)

     [Boot.description]
     mouse.drv=WIZ driver 1.01 for Windows(R) 3.00 Feb. 4. 1991

The CalComp Wiz Mouse is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
