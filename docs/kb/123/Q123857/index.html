SUMMARY
=======

Foreign DirSync requesters (third party gateways participating in DirSync) may
cause SRVMAIN -T (T2) to fail when generating DirSync mail back to the requester
at T2 time. DIRSYNC.LOG will report the following errors:

  Warning[ 9] Out of memory: SRVUPDS
  Fatal [159] Failure to send update mail to requesters

  &lt;address type&gt;:&lt;network&gt;/&lt;po&gt;

The requester fails to receive any address changes from the DirSync server, but
other requesters (Microsoft Mail postoffices) appear unaffected, and receive
address changes.

MORE INFORMATION
================

As documented in the "Directory Synchronization with Foreign Mail Systems"
manual, there are two ways the requester can request addresses from the DirSync
server: Inbody or Inattachment. Inbody means that the address transactions will
be included in the body of the mail message. Inattachment means that address
transactions will be included in a separate file that is an attachment to the
mail message.

The T2 failure and error messages result if the import request message from the
requester specifies "transactions=inbody" instead of
"transactions=inattachment." If Inbody is specified, SRVMAIN -T will create
SRVUPDS.GLB, a temporary file that contains all transactions that need to be
sent out to the various requesters during this cycle, on the disk. Then, in
memory on the computer running DirSync, SRVMAIN creates a mail message, and
tries to read in the entire contents of SRVUPDS as the message body into
available memory. If the list is large enough to exceed the available memory,
SRVMAIN fails to create the mail message and DIRSYNC.LOG reports the errors
listed above. No transactions will be sent back to the requester.

NOTE: This memory limitation shows up first when running SRVMAIN under MS- DOS,
but could occur under OS/2 as well (unlikely in real world circumstances).
SRVMAIN is a bound executable, capable of executing under both MS-DOS and OS/2.
Since OS/2 does not have the conventional memory (640K) limitation that MS-DOS
has, running DirSync under OS/2 will likely succeed under the same circumstances
that would make SRVMAIN fail under MS- DOS.

If "transactions=inattachment" is specified, then SRVMAIN builds a temporary file
on disk (TMPTRANS.GLB) from SRVUPDS that includes all the appropriate
transactions for that requester, and, after completion, attaches this file to
the requester update message, avoiding the memory limitation.
