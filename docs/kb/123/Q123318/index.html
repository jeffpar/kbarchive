-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This article provides a checklist of what must be accomplished before
Systems Management Server will install itself in the logon scripts
for a Microsoft network domain (Windows NT or LAN Manager):

1. Configure and enable the Directory Replicator service for the domain being
  managed by Systems Management Server. Systems Management Server looks for a
  REPL$ share on the domain controller (DC). If it doesn't exist, the Site
  Configuration Manager will not be able to copy the proper Systems Management
  Server logon support files to the Export\Scripts directory.

2. Using Systems Management Server Administrator, configure the Systems
  Management Server Site properties as follows:

  a. In the Clients dialog box, select Automatically Configure Workstation
     Logon Scripts.

  b. In the Domains dialog box, select Use All Detected Servers for each domain
     that you want logon scripts enabled.

  NOTE: At this point, Systems Management Server has been properly configured.
  It will then configure the user logon scripts for each domain to include the
  Smsls.bat entry, and copy the proper Systems Management Server support files
  to the REPL$ share during the next Site Configuration Manager watchdog cycle.
  This occurs by default every 24 hours, but can be forced immediately by using
  one of the two methods listed in step 3 below.

3. To force the watchdog cycle to occur immediately, use one of the following
  methods:

   - Toggle the Systems Management Server site property for logon scripts,
     changing it from its current state to the other state. This will toggle
     the site control file line "PROPERTY &lt;Logon
     Scripts&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;1&gt;" to 1 or 0. Site Configuration
     Manager will read this line and immediately configure the logon scripts
     appropriately. For example, if the Automatically Configure Workstation
     Logon Scripts site property in the Clients dialog box is clear, selecting
     it changes the flag from 0 to 1. This would then force Site Configuration
     Manager to configure logon scripts when it next reads the Sitectrl.ct1
     file.

   - Use the SENDCODE utility. It is located on the Systems Management Server
     CD, in the PSSTOOLS directory. At the Systems Management Server site
     server, go to a command prompt and type the following command:

  sendcode sms_site_config_manager 196

     If the Hierarchy Manager has not yet taken the proposed changes made for
     logon script configuration and passed this information to the Site
     Configuration Manager, the only way to expedite the process is to stop and
     restart the Hierarchy Manager service. If you use SENDCODE to force Site
     Configuration Manager to wake up under the old configuration (because
     Hierarchy Manager has not done its work yet) the configuration does not
     include the recent changes, and is a useless operation.

     This forces Site Configuration Manager to perform its watchdog cycle
     immediately and configure the Systems Management Server logon scripts for
     all users in the domains that were enabled in step 2 above.

NOTE: When you configure logon scripts in a domain that contains more than
one site server, do not use the Detect All Servers option. Be sure to
specify each server that is to be managed in the site properties for the
site that exclusively manages the server; otherwise two sites may compete
for the same server.
