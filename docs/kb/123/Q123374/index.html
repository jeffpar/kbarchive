The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks, versions 3.0, 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Form Designer, included with versions 3.x of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk
Networks, allows administrators to create custom forms to install on their Mail
servers. The Form Designer utilizes HyperCard as its design environment. While
it is possible to add and position specific fields and buttons on a form within
HyperCard, only limited functionality can be added using common HyperTalk
scripting commands.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a form is compiled and installed on the Mail server using the Form Mover
button, all the information appearing on the form is converted to Mail specific
resources and embedded in the Microsoft Mail Server Datafile. Common HyperTalk
scripts added to buttons or fields are ignored when the form is installed.

It is possible to add functionality to a custom form using specific commands in
the forms compile scripts or through a Form Control Procedure.

The compile script is used when the form is compiled and converted to resources
for the Mail Server's Datafile. It is possible to add a limited number of
commands to the compile script to modify the functionality of fields on a form.

For more information on using compile scripts, please see the following articles
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q102423 Mac Forms: Adding Hidden Text Feature to Fields

Information on writing Form Control Procedures (FCPs) is included with the
Microsoft Mail MPW C Software Development Kit (SDK). FCPs are application
specific Form code that is written in C and attached to the Form. Examples of
FCPs include the Sound form, which interfaces with sound driver software, the
Resizable Note, and the 80-column form included with version 3.1d of Mail for
AppleTalk Networks. It is important to note that writing FCPs for Mail for
AppleTalk Networks is intended for advanced developers only.

The Microsoft Mail MPW C SDK currently sells for $445 (US). More information on
the Microsoft Mail MPW C SDK is available by contacting Microsoft Consumer Sales
at (800) 426-9400.
