SUMMARY
=======

No File Format Application Programming Interface (FFAPI) Microsoft gateway
product (MHS, SMTP, X.400, or others) for Microsoft Mail for PC Networks can be
a requester for directory synchronization (Dir-Sync). Therefore, these gateway
addresses are not automatically distributed to downstream postoffices during the
Dir-Sync process. To include gateway addresses in Dir-Sync, the gateway
addresses, in an import-format text file, must be manually inserted into the
Dir-Sync process using the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks IMPORT.EXE utility.

A Mail administrator can get the import-format text file by either extracting the
addresses from an existing Microsoft Mail for PC Networks gateway postoffice
(using IMPORT.EXE), creating it manually, or obtaining it from a gateway host
administrator. Refer to Appendix A of the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks
"Administrator's Guide" for more information about the format of the
import-format text file.

NOTE: If you are including SMTP, X400, or MHS addresses in groups, you should NOT
use Dir-Sync to distribute these addresses.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The REBUILD.EXE utility creates the Global Address List (GAL) on each individual
postoffice from all the separate address lists on that postoffice. Therefore, if
a gateway address list exists at a specific postoffice, these addresses will be
included in the GAL. Most FFAPI-based gateways, the SNADS gateway, and the PROFS
gateway store their address lists in a hexadecimal identifier (hex-id) .XTN file
(&lt;hex-id&gt;.XTN). Other gateways, such as the SMTP, X.400, and MHS gateways,
store their address lists in .NME and .GLB files. For example, the X.400 gateway
uses X400.NME and X400.GLB.

On any postoffice, these gateway address lists will most likely be created by one
of two methods:

1. The administrator will run the IMPORT.EXE utility against an import-format
  text file, thereby populating the .USR or .NME/.GLB files with user address
  information.

2. The administrator can run the Microsoft Mail Administrator program
  (ADMIN.EXE) and manually enter the addresses under the Gateway, List menu
  item.

Either method will create an address list that REBUILD.EXE will incorporate into
the local GAL at that postoffice. Unfortunately, these addresses are not
automatically added into the Dir-Sync process.

To automatically include gateway addresses in Dir-Sync, the administrator must
first have an import-format text file. This file can be generated by one of two
methods:

1. If the gateway addresses already exist on one of the postoffices, the
  administrator can extract these addresses into an import-format text file by
  using the IMPORT.EXE utility with the -X option.

  NOTE: These addresses may have been added by the administrator with the
  ADMIN.EXE program (by selecting Gateway, List).

  The IMPORT.EXE command line for this extraction process is (this command line
  has been wrapped for readability; you should type the entire command on one
  line):

  " import admin -p&lt;password&gt; -x -g&lt;address_type&gt;
  -f&lt;ex_file&gt;.txt -d&lt;drive&gt;" (without the quotation marks)

  where &lt;ex_file&gt;.TXT is the extracted import-format text file (IMPORT.EXE
  will automatically create such a file with the proper format) and
  &lt;address_type&gt; is, for example, SMTP, SNADS, or X400, as outlined in
  Appendix A of the "Administrator's Guide."

2. If the gateway addresses do not already exist on one of the postoffices, use
  a standard text editor to create this import-format text file, as outlined in
  Appendix A of the "Administrator's Guide" under the "IMPORT Utility"
  description.

  After the gateway software (gateway &amp; access component) are installed and
  configured on the gateway postoffice and gateway access components are
  installed on downstream postoffices, create or acquire the import-format text
  file that contains your gateway addresses. (See Appendix A under the
  IMPORT.EXE utility of the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks Administrator's
  Guide for additional information on the format of this import-format text
  file.) Import these addresses for Dir-Sync on any postoffice (usually the
  gateway postoffice) that has the gateway access component installed by
  typing:

  " import admin -p&lt;password&gt; -e -f&lt;ex_file.txt&gt; -d&lt;drive&gt;"
  (without the quotation marks)

  Where EX_FILE.TXT is the import-format text file created either by the
  extraction process listed in Step 1 above or by a text editor.

  The use of the IMPORT.EXE utility with the -E option will populate the
  REQTRANS.GLB on the postoffice with all of the gateway addresses listed in
  the import-format text file. The Dir-Sync server must have the gateway access
  component installed for these addresses to be accepted and propagated.

  NOTE: The administrator must install the gateway access component on each
  postoffice that will receive gateway address updates during Dir-Sync.
