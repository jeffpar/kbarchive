SYMPTOMS
========

In Cinemania, when you are using the Dell S3 version 1.3 or 1.3a video drivers
and you jump from the Find Window, you receive the following error message:

  Cinemania has caused a GPF in S3645K.DRV at 003:0F9A

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install the Dell S3 drivers located on the Cinemania
CD. The S3_V233.EXE file on the Cinemania 95 CD is a self- extracting file. Run
this file at the MS-DOS command prompt to extract the drivers. Do the
following:

1. Copy the S3_V233.EXE file from the \AAMSSTP\DELL directory on the Cinemania
  95 disk to your hard disk. IMPORTANT: Do NOT copy this file to the Windows
  directory.

2. Change to the directory where you copied the S3_V233.EXE file.

3. Type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt:

  "s3_v233.exe" (without the quotation marks)

  This extract the driver files.

4. Restart Windows and then run Windows Setup, which is located in the Main
  group of Program Manager.

5. From the Options menu, choose Change System Settings.

6. From the Display list, select Other Display. (This should be the last option
  in the list.)

7. In the Windows Setup menu, type the path to the Dell S3 drivers. This is the
  directory to which you copied the S3_V233.EXE file.

8. Choose OK. From the list of display drivers, select the driver you want to
  use.

After you restart Windows, the new drivers are installed, and Cinemania 95
functions properly.

NOTE: This problem does not occur in Windows 95 when using the S3 drivers shipped
with Windows 95.
