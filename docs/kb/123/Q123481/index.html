The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1 
- Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
- Microsoft LAN Manager, version 2.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a computer running Windows NT version 3.1 is configured to redirect several
print queues from a LAN Manager for UNIX 2.2 server, the system reports the
following in the event log:

  System Error 1220
  AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO ESTABLISH A SESSION TO A LANMANAGER SESSION BUT THERE
  ARE TOO MANY SESSIONS ALREADY ESTABLISHED.

Print jobs also stack up as they wait their turn to print and the server beeps
continually.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because of a Windows NT redirector limit of two sessions with
an OS/2 server.

Some OS/2 and LAN Manager for UNIX servers can only handle two login sessions
from one client. The Windows NT version 3.1 redirector can't tell whether the
OS/2 server is one that supports only two logons, or if it supports more, so it
tries two (even though Microsoft LAN Manager version 2.2 supports more than
two).

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

To resolve this issue:

1. Upgrade to Windows NT version 3.5.

2. Run Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

3. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

  \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Rdr\Parameters

4. From the Edit menu choose Add Value.

5. Add the following:

     Value Name: Os2SessionLimit
     Data Type:  REG_DWORD
     Data:       100
     Radix:      Hex

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.1. This
problem was corrected in Windows NT 3.5. This problem was corrected in the
latest U.S. Service Pack for Windows NT 3.1. For information on obtaining this
update, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
