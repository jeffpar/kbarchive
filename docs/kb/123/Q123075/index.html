SYMPTOMS
========

If you place a picture with an animated background in your Pigture Show, the
background is not animated during the Pigture Show. Animated stickers, however,
are animated during the Pigture Show.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE PROBLEM
--------------------------

1. Go to the Painting Studio.

2. Click the Paint Bucket tool.

3. Click the Wallpaper roll, and select one of the first 13 backgrounds, which
  are animated.

4. Click Mona Weasel (the Sticker Picker) and select one of the animated
  stickers. The animated stickers are located on the sticker roll with a green
  film style border.

5. Save the file.

6. Exit the Painting Studio.

7. Run the Pigture Show wizard.

8. Place this file in your Pigture Show.

9. Click the Ready button, and then play the Pigture Show. The slide displays
  with the selected background, and the animated sticker moves across the
  slide, but the animated background remains stationary.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is by design. The first 13 backgrounds contain animation, which is a
constant looping pattern. Because of the repeating design, animated backgrounds
are not incorporated into the Pigture Show Play routine. Since the animated
pictures play only once each time they are selected, they can be easily inserted
into the play sequence.
