SUMMARY
=======

When the same source file (or a copy with the same name in a different
directory) is included in both a DLL and its calling application, the debugger
can become confused about which module in memory to set breakpoints in. For
example, a breakpoint set in the source file belonging to the DLL may be hit in
the DLL or in the application's copy of the source file, and the module in which
the breakpoint is hit may change from one debugging session to another.

WORKAROUND
==========

The best solution is to not use source files that have the same name in the DLL
and in its calling application. If you can't avoid it, try using the context
operator to resolve the breakpoint conflict. To do this, specify both the source
file and the EXE or DLL name in the breakpoint location field of the Breakpoints
dialog box using this syntax:

     {,source.cpp,target.exe} .line_number

-or-

     {,source.cpp,target.dll} .line_number

Here line_number is the actual decimal line number in the source code. You may
need to use full path names when specifying the source and the EXE or DLL
names.

NOTE: This workaround may not always be successful. If it doesn't work, you must
either rename one of the source file copies or live with the errant breakpoint
behavior.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For additional information on the purpose and use of the context operator, refer
to the "Using Breakpoints" section in the "Using the Debugger" chapter of the
Visual C++ Books Online "Visual C++ User's Guide." Specifically, in Visual C++
2.0, refer to the "General Syntax for Breakpoint Locations" entry in the "Using
Breakpoints" section; in Visual C++ 4.0, refer to the "Advanced Breakpoint
Syntax" entry of the "Using the Breakpoints Dialog Box" in the "Using
Breakpoints" section.
