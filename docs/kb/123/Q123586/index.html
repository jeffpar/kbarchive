-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moderate: Requires basic macro, coding, and interoperability skills.

SUMMARY
=======

The Setup Wizard included with the Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit (ADT)
version 2.0 does not enable you to create Compact and Repair icons for a custom
application. This article describes two methods you can use to create Compact
and Repair icons for a custom application.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Setup Wizard allows only one set of parameters for a custom application. In
almost all cases, the parameters are used to launch the custom application, and
therefore cannot be used for a Compact or Repair icon. If you add the /compact
and /repair parameters, the Setup Wizard ignores them.

The following two methods describe how to work around this behavior.

Method 1
--------

NOTE: Method 1 is the only method in this article that is supported by Microsoft
Product Support Services.

For information about how to create additional program groups and items with the
Setup Wizard, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q119724
  TITLE : ADT2: Creating Additional ADT Application Programs Groups, Items

Method 2
--------

WARNING: ANY USE BY YOU OF METHOD 2 IS AT YOUR OWN RISK. Microsoft provides this
information "as is" without warranty of any kind, either express or implied,
including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability and/or
fitness for a particular purpose.

Edit the SETUP.STF file on Disk 1 of the installation disks created by the Setup
Wizard to create Compact and Repair icons. Follow these steps to use this
method:

1. Make a backup copy of the SETUP.STF file on Disk 1 of the installation disks
  created by the Setup Wizard.

2. Open the SETUP.STF file in a spreadsheet application, such as Microsoft
  Excel.

3. Near the bottom of the file, locate the text "AddProgManItem" in column E.

4. Create a new line by increasing the Object ID counter in column A by one.
  Leave column B blank.

5. In column C, add the label "USER_UserPM_x" (without the quotation marks)
  where x is one greater than any other USER_UserPM_y label above. Leave column
  D blank.

6. In column E, enter the text "AddProgManItem" (without the quotation marks).

7. In column F, add the /compact and /repair parameters. The second entry is the
  icon description, and must be changed to something other than the original
  entry (you cannot have two icons with the same description). The third entry
  is the command-line parameter for the icon (this is where you add the
  /compact and /repair parameters). The following line is an example of a valid
  line in column F.

  NOTE: In the following sample line, an underscore (_) at the end of a line is
  used as a line-continuation character. Remove the underscore from the end of
  the line when re-creating this line.

  "My Application Group", "MyApp Maintenance", "%26\msarn200.exe _
        %321\myapp.mdb /ini %323\myapp.ini /compact /repair", _
        "%322\myapp.ico"

8. Find the label "---- User ProgMan Items ----" in column C. In that row, in
  column F, add the Object ID number for the new line you created to the end of
  the list of Object ID numbers.

9. In cell B16, increase the Maximum Object ID variable by one. Save and then
  close the SETUP.STF file.
