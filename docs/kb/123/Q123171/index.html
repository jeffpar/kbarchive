-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This article describes Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) event log IDs
4145 through 4290. These events represent error conditions.

Event Log IDs 4145 - 4290
-------------------------

Event   Description
-----   -----------

4145    WINS has encountered an error that is causing it to shut down.

4146    Rpl Pull thread is shutting down due to some error condition.

4147    Rpl Push thread is shutting down due to some error condition.

4148    Challenge thread is shutting down due to some error condition.

4149    A Worker thread is shutting down due to some error condition.

4150    An abnormal error was encountered during WINS initialization.

4151    WINS could not set up the database properly.

4152    A worker thread could not be created.

4153    A thread could not be created.

4154    An event could not be created.

4155    The Name Challenge  Request thread could not be created.

4156    A key could not be created/opened.

4157    The WINS configuration key could not be created/opened.

4158    The WINS PULL configuration key could not be created/opened.

4159    The WINS PUSH configuration key could not be created/opened.

4160    The WINS PARAMETERS key could not be created/opened.

4161    The Registry change notification event could not be created.

4162    The format of time should be hh:mm:ss. Check value of "SpTime"
       in the Registry.

4163    The Registry Notify Function returned an error.

4164    The Name Registration Response could not be sent due to some
       error. This Error was encountered by a NBT request thread.

4165    The Name Registration Response could not be sent due to some
       error. This error was encountered by a RPL thread.

4166    The Name Registration Response could not be sent due to some
       error. This error was encountered by the Name Challenge Thread.

4167    The Name Release Response could not be sent due to some error.
       This error was encountered by a NBT request thread.

4168    The Name Query Response could not be sent due to some error.
       This error was encountered by a NBT request thread.

4169    A record could not be registered because it already existed.
       However, the same record then could not be found. The database
       might be corrupt.

4170    WINS could not create a heap (a portion of memory reserved for
       the program's use) because of a resource shortage. Check if the
       computer is running short of virtual memory.

4171    An error has occurred from which WINS will try to recover. If
       recovery fails, check previous Event log entries to determine
       what went wrong, and take appropriate action on that error.

4172    WINS could not create the notification socket. Make sure the
       TCP/IP driver is installed and running properly.

4173    WINS could not create the UDP socket for listening for
       connection notification messages sent  by another thread (PULL
       thread) in the local WINS.

4174    WINS could not create the TCP socket for listening to TCP
       connections. Make sure the TCP/IP driver is installed and
       running properly.

4175    WINS could not create the TCP socket for making a TCP connection.
       Make sure the TCP/IP driver is installed and running properly.

4176    Could not bind an address to a socket.

4177    Could not listen on the listening socket.

4178    Select returned with an error.

4179    %1 returned with an error code of %2.

4180    GetSockName returned with an error. WINS created a socket and
       asked bind to bind a handle to it. On calling getsockname to
       determine the address bound, it got an error.

4181    An attempt to connect to the remote WINS server with address %1
       returned with an error. Check to see that the remote WINS server
       is running and available, and that WINS is  running on that
       server.

4182    Could not accept on a socket.

4183    Could not read from the UDP socket.

4184    Could not read from NETBT.

4185    Could not close a socket.

4186    Sendto could not send all the bytes.

4187    Could not send UDP message to WINS client.

4188    Sendto returned with an error.

4189    Winsock recv function returned with an unexpected error.

4190    WinSock send function returned with an unexpected error.

4191    A message was received on an association. The association is in
       a bad state. This indicates a bug in WINS code.

4192    Could not allocate a responder association.

4193    Could not allocate an initiator association.

4194    Could not allocate an implicit dialogue.

4195    Could not allocate an explicit dialogue.

4196    Could not look up the assoc block for an NBT association. Check
       if the message read is corrupted. WINS looks at bit 11-14 of the
       message to determine if the association is from another WINS or
       from an NBT node. It is possible that the bits are corrupted or
       that there is a mismatch between what the two WINS servers expect
       to see in those bits (maybe you changed the value to be put in
       code and did not increment the version number sent during
       association setup.

4197    Could not allocate a UDP Buffer.

4198    Could not free a UDP Buffer.

4199    Could not create a communication subsystem thread.

4200    A WINS thread could not signal the main thread after closing its
       session. This would be the last thread in WINS closing the
       database.

4201    A WINS thread could not signal a handle.

4202    A WINS thread could not reset a handle.

4203    An error was encountered in the database. You might need to
       restore the database from a backup.

4204    Could not update a record with name %1.

4205    WINS could not update the owner id - Address mapping table in the
       database.  This indicates a serious error in the software.  It
       means that the in-memory table that maps to the database table has
       gotten out of sync with the database table.

4206    The Push Thread was requested for a range of records but could not
       find any in the range. This is a serious error. Make sure that the
       time intervals are set properly. If the tombstone interval and
       timeout intervals are not correct (i.e. too small-- being &lt;&lt; the
       replication interval), the above condition is possible. This is
       because the records might get changed into tombstones and then
       deleted before the remote WINS can pull them. In the same vein, if
       the refresh interval is set to be &lt;&lt; replication interval then the
       records could get released before a WINS can pull them (a released
       record is not sent).

4207    The Tmm Thread could not be signaled. This indicates that this
       computer is extremely overloaded or that the WINS application
       has failed.

4208    Tmm could not signal the client thread. This indicates something
       seriously wrong.

4209    WINS could not get information about a key.

4210    WINS could not get information about the PULL key.

4211    WINS could not get information about the PUSH key.

4212    WINS could not get information about the DATAFILES key.

4213    WINS could not get information about the SPEC_GRP_MASKS key.

4214    WINS could not open a subkey of the PULL key

4215    WINS could not open a subkey of the PUSH key.

4216    WINS could not get the time interval from a PULL record.

4217    WINS could not get the time interval from a PUSH record.

4218    WINS could not get the update count from a PUSH record.

4219    WINS could not close an open key.

4220    WINS Timer thread encountered an exception.

4221    WINS Push thread encountered an exception. It will try to recover.

4222    WINS Pull thread encountered an exception during the process of
       sending a push notification to another WINS. The exception
       code is given below in the data section.

4223    A WINS RPC thread encountered an error/exception.

4224    WINS TCP Listener thread encountered an exception.

4225    WINS UDP Listener thread encountered an exception.

4226    WINS Scavenger thread encountered an exception.

4227    WINS Challenger thread encountered an exception.

4228    A WINS worker thread encountered an exception.

4229    WINS Scavenger thread could not scavenge a record. Will ignore
       this error and continue on to the next record if there.

4230    WINS Rpl Pul Handler could not connect to a WINS server. All
       retries failed. WINS will try again after certain number of
       replication time intervals have elapsed.

4231    WINS did not find any subkeys under the PULL key

4232    WINS did not find any subkeys under the PUSH key

4233    An error has prevented wins from updating the database. The
       database may be corrupt.

4234    WINS is has been asked to pull entries from its own self. Check
all
       the subkeys of the PULL key for this WINS.

4235    WINS was unable to propagate the push trigger.

4236    WINS sent a name query or a name release with a certain
       transaction id. It got back a response to its request, which
       differed either in the name that it contained or in the opcode.
       WINS has thrown the response away.

4237    The Database has been found to be inconsistent. More specifically,
       the number of owners found in the Name Address Mapping table are
       different from the number found in the Owner Address Mapping table

4238    The local WINS requested a remote WINS to update the version
       number of a database record owned by it. The remote WINS could not
       do it and reported an error.

4239    WINS got an error while registering replicas. It will not register
       any more replicas of this WINS (address is in data section 4th-8th
       byte; also check previous log entry) at this time.  Please check
       a previous log entry to determine the reason for this. If this
       error persists over time i.e. you get the same error during
       subsequent replication with the above partner WINS, you may want
       to restore the database from the backup.

4240    WINS got an exception while trying to register a group's replica
       with name %1. The replica is owned by WINS with address %2.

4241    WINS got an error while trying to register a unique replica with
       name %1. The replica is owned by WINS with address %2.

4242    WINS got an error while trying to register a unique entry %1.

4243    WINS got an error while trying to register a group entry %1.

4244    WINS got an exception while trying to update the version number of
       a record in the database. It is not known whether the exception
       occurred after  or before the update.

4245    WINS got an exception while trying to release a record in
       the database. It is not known whether the exception occurred
       after or before the release was done.

4246    WINS got an exception while trying to query a record in the
       database.

4247    WINS received a replica whose state is incorrect. For example, the
       state may be RELEASED or the replica might be an Internet group
       that does not have any members (because all members are timed out)
       but state is not TOMBSTONE.

4248    The Scavenger thread was unable to change its priority level.

4249    A name release request was received for a record that didn't match
       the unique/group type indicated in the request.  The request has
       been ignored.

4250    A name release request was received for a record %2 that didn't
       have the same address as the requestor. The request has been
       ignored.

4251    An exception was encountered while trying send a push trigger
       notification to a remote WINS.

4252    An exception was encountered while trying service a pull range
       request from a remote WINS.

4253    WINS was either provided a bad command code or else it got
       corrupted.

4254    The static data file that is used to initialize WINS database is
       too big.

4255    An error was encountered during an operation on the static data
       file %1.

4256    The name of the file after expansion is bigger than WINS can
       handle. The unexpanded string is %1.

4257    WINS could not do Static initialization

4258    An error was encountered during configuration or reconfiguration
       of WINS.

4259    Error encountered during configuration/reconfiguration of WINS.

4260    A lock error has occurred.  This could happen if the WINS is
       trying to send a response on a dialogue that is no longer ACTIVE.
       An implicit dialogue can cease to exist if the association it is
       mapped to terminates. In such a case, getting a lock error is
       fine. It is normal.

4261    Wins could not import static mappings from the file (%1).
       Please verify that the file exists and is readable.

4262    WINS encountered an exception while processing a push
       trigger/update notification. The exception code is given below.
       If it is indicates a comm. failure check if the remote WINS that
       sent the trigger went down. If the remote WINS is on a different
       subnet, then maybe the router is down.

4263    WINS encountered an exception while processing a pull trigger.

4264    WINS encountered an exception while retrieving data records

4265    The WINS server cannot make/accept this connection since the
       limit of connections has been reached. Remedy for this is to
       increase FD_SETSIZE in winsock.h and recompile the server.

4266    The exception was encountered during the processing of a grp
       member.

4267    The Scavenger thread encountered an exception while cleaning up
       the owner-add table. It will try again after the Verify Interval
       has elapsed.

4268    WINS is trying to update the version number of a database record
       that it does not own.  This is a serious error if the WINS
       server is updating the record after a conflict.  It is not a
       serious error if the WINS server is updating the record as a
       result of a request to do so from a remote WINS server (when a
       remote WINS server notices a conflict between an active owned entry
       and a replica it informs the owner of the replica to update the
       version number of the record. It is  possible that the replica is
       no longer owned by the remote WINS). Check a previous log entry to
       determine which situation applies here.

4269    The special group mask specified is invalid. It has either a non-
       hex character or is less than 32 characters in length. A hex
       character is in the range 0-F (or 0-f).

4270    Wins tried increasingly sized buffers to get the local name table
       from NETBT but got a buffer overflow return status each time.

4271    WINS did not get back any names from NETBT when it did an adapter
       status.

4272    At initialization, WINS creates a security object and attaches an
       ACL to it. This security object is then used to authenticate RPC
       calls made to WINS. WINS could not create the above security
       object. In short, WINS could not initialize with the security
       subsystem properly.

4273    The client does not have the permissions required to execute the
       function.

4274    When WINS replicated with its partners, it found that one or more
       of them thought that it had more data that it actually has.
       WINS adjusted its counter so that new registrations/updates are
       seen by its partners. This means that recovery did not work
       properly. You may want to check which of the partners has the
       highest version number corresponding to the local WINS. Then shut
       down WINS and restart after specifying this number in the
       Registry.

4275    There are too many concurrent static initializations going on.
       The number of such initializations currently active is given below.
       This could be either as a result of reinitialization or importings
       from the WINS Manager tool. Try again later. The number of
       currently active initializations is given below in the data
       section.

4276    WINS encountered a memory error.  Check to see if the system is
       running out of virtual memory.

4277    WINS noticed some database corruption. The record with name %1 is
       corrupt. It could be that recovery from the last crash did not
       work properly. WINS will try to recover. You may decide however to
       restore the database from the backup.

4278    The following name (%1) is too long. It has not been put in the
       WINS database. If you want this long name (&gt; 15 characters),
       enclose it within quotes.

4279    Record with name (%1) has bad address. It has not been put in the
       WINS database.

4280    The machine you are running the WINS server on does not have a
       valid address. When WINS requested the system for the address, it
       got 0.0.0.0 as the address. NOTE: WINS binds to the first adapter
       in a machine with more than one adapter bound to TCP/IP. Check the
       binding order of adapters and make sure the first one has a valid
       IP address for the WINS server.

4281    WINS encountered an error doing backup of the database to
       directory %1.

4282    WINS countered an error while deleting the file %1.

4283    WINS encountered an error while deleting one or more records of
       WINS with address %1. Check a previous log entry to determine what
       went wrong.

4284    WINS encountered an error while getting the browser names for a
       client.

4285    The length of the message sent by another WINS indicates a very
       big message. There may have been a corruption of the data on the
       wire. WINS will ignore this message, terminate the connection with
       the remote WINS, and continue on.

4286    The replicator PULL thread of WINS encountered an exception while
       processing a request. Check other log entries to determine what
       went wrong.

4287    WINS does not support this functionality as yet.

4288    WINS machine has %1 processors. It has %2 bytes of physical memory
       It has %3 bytes of available memory for allocation.

4289    Record with name (%1) could not replace another record in the db.
       The Version number of the record is (%2). The version number of
       record in db  is (%3)

4290    WINS could not come up due to missing/corrupt database.
       Restore the database using WINSADMN and then restart
       WINS. If WINS still does not come up, start with a
       fresh  copy of the database. To do this:

       1) delete all the files
          - system.mdb, winstmp.mdb files from the
            %%SystemRoot%%\system32\wins directory.
          - wins.mdb from the %%SystemRoot%%\system32 directory
            or one that you selected through the Registry.
          - jet*.log files from the %%SystemRoot%%\system32 directory
            or one that you selected through the Registry.

       2) copy %%SystemRoot%%\system32\system.mdb to
          %%SystemRoot%%\system32\wins directory

       3) net start wins
