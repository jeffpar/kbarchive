SYMPTOMS
========

When users connect to a Web site that is hosted on Web servers positioned behind
a Cisco LocalDirector, they may be disconnected from a Web site and receive the
following error message:

  Your session has timed out please log in again

CAUSE
=====

The sticky settings on the Cisco LocalDirector are not set correctly, or have
been modified. Clients are not being directed to the same server behind the
LocalDirector. The ASP sessions on the servers that the client previously
reached time out and send the error message.

RESOLUTION
==========

Reconfigure the LocalDirector using the sticky command to ensure that the same
client reaches the same server behind the LocalDirector. Information about
configuring a Cisco LocalDirector can be obtained from a Cisco vendor or from
the Cisco Web site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The sticky command ensures that the client (based on IP address) reaches the
same server throughout the course of the transaction, and is used primarily when
requiring consistent or constant connections to the same server (similar to
affinity in the Windows NT Load Balancing Service). The sticky command measures
a period of inactivity in the client. After the timeout elapses, the client
requests may be sent to another server.
