MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. In German Word 97, open a new blank document. Save it by using a name that is
  at least 55 characters long, excluding path and file extension. For example,
  name it "The name of this file is more than fifty-five characters in length."
  (without the quotation marks)

2. Switch to Seiten-Layout (page layout) view.

3. Type "=rand(100)" (without the quotation marks) and then press ENTER. This
  generates about six pages of text.

4. Go to the beginning of the document, and type some German text with several
  spelling errors. For example, create random text by typing rapidly.

5. Press F7 to start the spelling checker.

6. In the spelling checker dialog box, click Ignorieren (Ignore) several times.
  Then click Schliessen (Close).

  -or-

  Click Abbrechen (Cancel) in the spelling checker dialog box.

  Result: You receive the error message described in the "Symptoms" section of
  this article.
