STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, follow these steps:

1. Stop the SMS Executive and the SMS Inventory Agent services on the site
  server.

2. Rename the Invproc.dll file in the SMS\Site.srv\X86.bin folder to
  Invproc.old.

3. Copy the new Invproc.dll file to the folder that is listed in step 2.

4. Replace the Invwin32.exe file in the
  &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Site.srv\&lt;Platform&gt;.bin folder on the site server with
  the version obtained from the hotfix.

5. Replace the Os2bios.exe, Inv32cli.exe, Invwin32.exe, and Getcomp.exe files in
  the &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\X86.bin folder on the
  site server with the versions obtained from the hotfix.

6. Replace the Inv32cli.exe and Invwin32.exe files in the
  &lt;SMS_root&gt;\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\Alpha.bin folder on the site
  server with the versions obtained from the hotfix.
