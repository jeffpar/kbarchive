-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP6, 4.0 SP6a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to a computer that is running Remote Access Services (RAS), you
are successfully authenticated by a Windows NT 4.0-based domain controller.
However, if you disconnect and then immediately reconnect, you may receive the
following error message:

  A domain controller for your domain could not be contacted. You have been
  logged on using cached account information. Changes to your profile since you
  last logged on may not be available.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the RAS client receives a new Transmission Control
Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) address from the RAS server when you
reconnect. The authenticating domain controller does not update its local
NetBIOS name cache with the new TCP/IP address of the RAS client, causing the
RAS client authentication not to succeed.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Apply it only to
computers that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive
additional testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Windows NT 4.0 service pack that
contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The typical support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.
