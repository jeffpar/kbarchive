The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an Exchange Server computer attempts to initiate a Routing and Remote
Access Service (RAS) connection to another Exchange Server computer, the
receiving server may refuse the connection and log the following 9301 warning

  The message transfer gateway that uses the network address %2 and the
  transport stack %1 could not be found. Check the configuration of the mail
  gateway.

where %2 is the hexadecimal representation of an Internet Protocol (IP) address
that is pulled from the IP RAS pool on the receiving server.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because when you use a modem to send a message, the modem
queries the receiving server to receive an IP address. When you use Routing and
RAS over X.400, this query causes problems. X.400 compares the IP address of the
message to the IP address that is displayed in the Stack tab of the connector,
which is the IP address of the originating server. Because the two IP addresses
do not match, the connector refuses the connection attempt and generates the
9301 warning.

RESOLUTION
==========

Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 1 and later versions of Exchange Server allow
you to define an IP address to use for outbound X.400 connections over Routing
and RAS. To implement this feature, perform the following steps on the
originating Routing and RAS Exchange Server computer:

1. Identify the Relative Distinguished Name (RDN) of the X.400 Connector by
  using the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program in raw mode. You
  need this name to implement the necessary registry modifications on the
  server:

WARNING: If you use the raw mode of the Exchange Server Administrator program
(admin /r) incorrectly, serious problems may occur that may require you to
reinstall Microsoft Windows NT Server, Microsoft Exchange Server, or both.
Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems that result from using raw mode
incorrectly can be solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.

  a. Start the Exchange Server Administrator program in raw mode by typing the
     following at a command prompt:

  c:\exchsrvr\bin\admin /r

  b. Double-click Site, double-click Configuration, double-click Connectors,
     and then select the X.400 Connector object in the right pane.

  c. On the File menu, click Raw Properties to open the raw properties of the
     X.400 Connector.

  d. In the Object Attribute column, click Obj-Dist-Name, and in the Attribute
     Value box, scroll to the right until you locate the last "cn=" value. This
     is the RDN that you use to create the registry key name. For example, if
     the X.400 Connector object is named "TCP to MTA B," the value for the
     Obj-Dist-Name object attribute is displayed similar to the following:

  /o=Organization/ou=Site/cn=Configuration/cn=Connection/cn=TCP to MTA B

     In this example, the RDN value is "TCP to MTA B." Select this value, and
     copy the value.

2. Use the RDN value ("TCP to MTA B" in this example) that you copied from the
  Exchange Server Administrator program in raw mode to create a registry key:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  a. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

  b. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeMTA\Parameters

  c. On the Edit menu, click Add Key, and then add a registry key. In the Key
     Name box, paste the RDN value that you copied from the Exchange Server
     Administrator program in raw mode, and leave the Class box blank. In this
     example, the Key Name is "TCP to MTA B."

  d. Select the new registry key. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then
     add the following registry value:

  Value Name: Stack IP Address Override
  Data Type: REG_SZ
  Value: The IP address of the originating server, in standard dot notation (for
  example, 123.123.123.123)

     This IP address is now used as the From IP address when you create a
     connection to the recipient server.

  e. Quit Registry Editor.

3. Stop and then restart the Exchange Server message transfer agent (MTA)
  service so that the changes take effect.

Note that these changes are only required for X.400 Connectors that create
outbound Routing and RAS connections. This change does not affect incoming
messages.
