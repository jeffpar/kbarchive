-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 Professional Edition 
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 Professional Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to edit the bitmap image of the certificate that you
have been awarded for completing a successful Checkride in Microsoft Flight
Simulator 2000 or Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To edit the bitmap image of the certificate that you have been awarded for
completing a successful Checkride, use the following methods in the order in
which they are presented.

Save the Certificate as a Bitmap Image
--------------------------------------

To save the certificate as a bitmap image:

1. When you are prompted to enter your name after you successfully complete a
  Checkride in Flight Simulator 2000 or Flight Simulator 2002, type your name,
  and then press ENTER.

2. When the certificate is displayed, press ALT+PRINT SCREEN.

  NOTE: On most keyboards, the PRINT SCREEN key is located at the top of the
  keyboard to the right of the F12 key.

3. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, and then click Paint.

4. On the Edit menu, click Paste.

  If you are prompted to scale the bitmap image to a larger size, click Yes.

5. If you want to crop the image, do so.

6. On the File menu, click Save As.

7. In the "Save in" box, click the location where you want to save the file.

8. In the "File name" box, type a file name, and then click Save.

NOTE: Regardless of which Checkride you just completed, if you press ALT+TAB to
switch back to Flight Simulator 2000 after you paste the certificate into Paint,
the Private Pilot certificate is displayed. However, if you click Print on the
File menu in Flight Simulator 2000 or Flight Simulaotr 2002, the certificate
that corresponds to the Checkride you just completed is printed.

Edit the Bitmap Image of the Certificate
----------------------------------------

You can open the bitmap image file of the certificate in Paint from the Fs2000 or
Fs2002 folder, and then edit the image in Paint. But this method requires that
you type your name directly on the certificate in Paint.

To edit the bitmap image of the certificate that you have been awarded for
completing a Checkride:

NOTE: The following method assumes that you installed Flight Simulator 2000 or
Flight Simulator 2002 to its default path and that Paint is the default program
for opening bitmap image (.bmp) files.

1. Right-click Start, and then click Explore.

2. In the left pane, double-click Program Files.

3. Double-click Microsoft Games.

4. Double-click Fs2000 or Fs2002.

5. Click the Uires folder.

6. In the right pane, double-click the .bmp certificate file that you want to
  open:

  The four certificate files that are available in Flight Simulator 2000 are:

  
   - Airtransp.bmp
   - Commercial.bmp
   - Instrument.bmp
   - Privatepilot.bmp

  The four certificate files that are available in Flight Simulator 2002 are:

  
   - Gsimgcertif_Airtransport.bmp
   - Gsimgcertif_Commercial.bmp
   - Gsimgcertif_Instrument.bmp
   - Gsimgcertif_Privatepilot.bmp
   - Gsimgcertif__Solo.bmp

  NOTE: If the .bmp file does not open in Paint, press and hold down the SHIFT
  key as you right-click the file, and then click Open With. In the list of
  installed programs, click MSPaint, and then click OK.

7. On the toolbar, click A.

  Two new buttons should appear at the bottom of the toolbar.

8. Draw a text box over the area where you want your name to appear on the
  certificate.

9. On the Fonts toolbar, select a font and a font size, and then type your
  name.

  NOTE: If you click outside of the text box, you close the edit window for this
  text box permanently, and you are unable to continue editing this text. Make
  sure that you make all of the necessary changes, such as applying the
  transparent background in step 10, before you click outside of the text box.

10. On the Paint toolbar, click the bottom button, which features a cylinder,
  ball, and cube. The cube in this bottom button is enclosed in a box with a
  transparent background. When you click this button, you make the background
  of the text block transparent.

11. On the File menu, click Save As.

12. In the "Save in" box, click the location where you want to save the
  database.

13. In the "File name" box, type a file name such as "MyCommercialCert.bmp"
  (without the quotation marks), and then click Save.
