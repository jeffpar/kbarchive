-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If an Exchange Server recipient is a member of a Novell GroupWise distribution
list, the entire membership of the distribution list is displayed in the To box
when the Exchange Server user receives the e-mail.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur because of the application programming interface (API)
gateway.

E-mail that is destined for a foreign domain starts out in the client message
database, and then the message transfer agent (MTA) moves the e-mail to the
following API directory:

  (&lt;domain&gt;)\Wpgate\Api\Wpcsout\Apixxx\O-7

The API gateway retrieves the file, converts it, and then separates the header
from the message. The API gateway then puts the header in the Wpgate\Api\Api_out
directory and the message and attachments in the
(&lt;domain&gt;)\Wpgate\Api\Att_out directory.

When you open the .api file in the Api_out directory, the distribution list is
expanded under the ALL-TO keyword section. The ALL-TO section is a list of all
of the primary recipients of a message, but not courtesy copy (cc) or blind
courtesy copy (bcc) recipients. After the API gateway performs this conversion,
the GWRouter component of Exchange Server retrieves the e-mail, the e-mail is
converted by the connector and delivered, and there is no further manipulation
by the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Novell GroupWise.

WORKAROUND
==========

To obtain workarounds for this issue, contact Novell Support.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a GroupWise custom recipient is a member of an Exchange Server distribution
list, this behavior does not occur. When the GroupWise user receives the e-mail,
only the distribution list name is in the To box.

Additional query words: GroupWise, DL
