SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use a roaming profile, you may be unable to run some of the
available programs that are configured in your roaming profile.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the computer you are using has little free disk space
(approximately equal to or less than the roaming profile size) on the boot
partition of your hard disk.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Apply it only to
computers that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive
additional testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Windows NT 4.0 service pack that
contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The typical support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English-language version of this fix should have the following file
attributes or later:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Windows NT 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you log on to a client computer, your roaming profile is copied to the
local client computer as a locally cached profile. However, if the computer you
are using has a very low amount of free hard disk space, you can damage the
locally cached profile. Also, when you log off from this client computer, your
locally cached profile is copied to your roaming profile, and this may damage
your permanent roaming profile.
