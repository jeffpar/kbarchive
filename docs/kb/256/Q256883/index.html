MORE INFORMATION
================

Cover: For Exam 70-222 No Longer Applies
----------------------------------------

The front cover, spine, and back cover of this Training Kit imply that the
Training Kit is geared toward the MCP Exam 70-222, however this no longer
applies due to the changes in the objectives for this exam.

Exam 70-222 is still in development and will be released in its beta version by
July 2000. Because the objectives for the exam were not yet finalized when this
Training Kit was first published, the Training Kit does not map exactly to this
exam, nor to the direction this exam is taking in its development.

Since the exam objectives have changed, please disregard the references on the
cover.


Page xxii &amp; 25: Hardware Requirements Should Read Pentium 133
-------------------------------------------------------------

instead of Pentium 166.

Page 304: Incorrect Scope In Figure 10.3
----------------------------------------
