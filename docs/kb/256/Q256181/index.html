SUMMARY
=======

Do remote-control utilities, such as pcAnywhere and Carbon Copy, have to comply
with guidelines to expose the keyboard focus location in order to receive
Windows 2000 certification?

Remote-control utilities are currently exempted from the requirement to expose
the location of the keyboard focus on the host computer to software running on
the client computer. This exemption will probably be removed in the future when
various technical difficulties are resolved.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Accessibility of any communication requires three components to cooperate and
follow accessible-design guidelines:

- The source of information must provide data needed by people with
  disabilities.

- The pipeline that transmits information must preserve the accessibility data
  and provide it to the client software.

- The client software must take the accessibility data and make it available to
  the user or to accessibility aids running on the user's behalf. (It may also
  have to explicitly request that the source provide this data.)

Remote control applications consist of two components running on separate systems
and communicating over a network or similar infrastructure. Typically, the user
is working at one workstation where the client component of the utility allows
him or her to see an image of what is appearing on a separate host computer. The
user's input is gathered on the client computer and transmitted to the host,
where it is simulated as if the user were working on the host computer. Then,
any output is gathered on the host computer and transmitted to and displayed on
the client computer. In this case, one might argue that a remote control utility
is a client utility that is not getting accessibility information, such as the
location of the keyboard focus on the host computer, and so cannot present it to
the user. However, the remote control utility consists not only of a client
portion but also the pipeline that gathers information on the host computer and
transmits it over the network to its client component. Currently, it gathers and
transmits information about what drawing objects appear on the screen. It is
clear that it could, if necessary, also gather and transmit information about
the keyboard focus location.

Unfortunately, while it is easy to "remote" the focus once you know it, at this
time it is very difficult for applications to track the focus properly in order
to know what to remote. Therefore, requiring this would represent an undue
burden on software applications, so at this time remote control applications are
exempted from this requirement.

This exemption applies only to remote-control applications. It does not represent
a general exemption for all components that sit between some source of
information and the user's operating environment. For example, the exemption
would not permit applications that host COM objects to interfere with those
objects' ability to comply with accessibility or certification guidelines.

In the future, Microsoft may provide helper libraries that make it easier to
track to focus. With such libraries in place, it is likely that remote control
applications would be required to gather and transmit this data.
