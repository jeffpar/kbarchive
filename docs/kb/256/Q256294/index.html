-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Delegate rules may be disabled when those rules act on e-mail messages sent
through a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) port.

CAUSE
=====

Because a delegate rule works with Exchange Server addresses, the information
store disables the rule when it encounters an error if the e-mail message is
sent from non-Exchange Server address. After the rule is disabled, the rule does
not start, even if the e-mail message is sent from Microsoft Outlook.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
