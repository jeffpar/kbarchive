SUMMARY
=======

Many application developers try to use a dynamic-link library (DLL) as a second
application. However, DLLs are designed to provide resources to applications.

Two problems typically arise with the use of DLLs:

1. A DLL opens a file and leaves it open.

2. The DLL improperly allocates memory.

This article addresses these two issues.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a DLL opens a file, the file handle is stored in the task database (TDB).
The TDB is similar to, but not the same as the program segment prefix (PSP) used
by applications that are not based on Windows. Because the DLL does not have a
TDB, the handle is stored in the TDB of the application that called the DLL.

If the file is left open when the application terminates, the handle is freed and
becomes invalid. A future attempt to use the handle results in an attempt to
access an invalid file handle.

Files should be opened, read from or written to, and closed as quickly as
possible within the application.

When a DLL allocates global memory, the handle is stored in the TDB of the
calling application. For similar reasons to the file case, if a DLL allocates
global memory and the application that caused the allocation terminates, the
global memory block is freed. An attempt to use the memory block will result in
a general protection violation, usually reported as an unrecoverable application
error (UAE).

To avoid this problem, global memory allocations from a DLL should specify the
GMEM_DDESHARE flag. When this flag is specified, the allocated memory is bound
to the DLL code segment, not an application. Because the DLL owns the memory,
when the application that caused the allocation terminates, the memory remains
valid.

When the DLL terminates, the memory block is freed.
