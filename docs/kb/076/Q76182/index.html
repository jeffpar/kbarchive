-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22

SUMMARY
=======

Above DISC uses a driver called ABOVE.EXE to emulate expanded memory in extended
memory or, in some cases, on a hard disk. If ABOVE.EXE is used with HIMEM.SYS
and with DOS=HIGH, or in some cases with just HIMEM.SYS, the computer may stop
responding (hang) on startup, beep uncontrollably, or continually reboot.
ABOVE.EXE may also cause problems with caching programs (for example,
SMARTDRV.SYS) and memory managers (for example, QEMM).

MORE INFORMATION
================

ABOVE.EXE uses the high memory area (HMA), which is located between 1024K and
1088K in extended memory. HIMEM.SYS also uses the HMA. On some computers, there
is a conflict between HIMEM.SYS and ABOVE.EXE, especially when MS-DOS is loaded
high. This is because HIMEM.SYS loads MS-DOS into the HMA. Even when MS-DOS is
not loaded high, HIMEM.SYS may not work with ABOVE.EXE.

According to Above Software Technical Support, the following steps may allow you
to work around this problem:

1. Run the install program for Above DISC from inside the ABOVE subdirectory.

2. Set hardware to normal IO 286/386.

3. Under Change Feature, make sure EMS 4.0 is selected with a check mark.

NOTE: This procedure does not work on all computers; some still cannot work with
the DOS=HIGH setting.

According to Above Software, version 4.1b of Above DISC is fully compatible with
MS-DOS 5.0. However, version 4.1c is required for MS-DOS 6.0.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of Microsoft;
we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products' performance
or reliability.
