SUMMARY
=======

Using the BUFFERS.COM utility from any version Quarterdeck expanded memory
manager 386 (QEMM386) before 6.0 with MS-DOS version 4.0 or later will trigger
the following error message:

  BUFFERS requires DOS version 2 or 3 to run

Support for MS-DOS version 5.0 was added in the 6.0 release of QEMM386.
BUFFERS.COM continues to be incompatible with MS-DOS versions 4.00, 4.01 and
4.01a.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Look-ahead buffers, introduced in MS-DOS 4.0, allow multiple sector processing
when sequential data is read from or written to a disk. Quarterdeck BUFFERS.COM
does not support this format.

BUFFERS.COM, prior to QEMM version 6.0, is designed to allow users with QEMM and
MS-DOS versions earlier than 4.0 to load system buffers out of conventional
memory with the following line in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

     loadhi buffers=##

This loads the disk buffers into High RAM, also known as Upper Memory Blocks.
Buffers created with BUFFERS.COM are in addition to buffers allocated via the
BUFFERS= statement in CONFIG.SYS.

With the 6.0 release of QEMM, support for MS-DOS 5.0 was added to BUFFERS.COM and
buffers can be loaded high through the AUTOEXEC.BAT in the manner listed above.
However, there is less need to use BUFFERS.COM with MS-DOS 5.0 as up to 48 disk
buffers can be loaded into the high memory area (HMA) when MS-DOS is loaded
high. For example, the following lines in the CONFIG.SYS file will allocate 20
buffers which load with MS-DOS into the HMA:

     device=c:\qemm\qemm386.sys
     dos=high
     buffers=20

If more than 48 buffers are in specified using BUFFERS=, all of the buffers
allocated by BUFFERS= will be loaded into conventional memory.

Although all versions of BUFFERS.COM continue to be incompatible with MS-DOS
versions 4.0, 4.01, and 4.01a, buffers can be loaded into expanded memory (when
present) by adding /X to the end of the buffers line in the CONFIG.SYS file. For
example, the line below loads 20 disk buffers into expanded memory:

     buffers=20 /x
