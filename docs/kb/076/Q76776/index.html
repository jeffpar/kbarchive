-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows with Multimedia Extensions, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following information is contained in the Windows with Multimedia Extensions
version 1.0 README.TXT file. The Setup program copies this file to the Windows
with Multimedia Extensions directory.

This information does not apply to later versions of Windows.

RUNNING SPECIFIC NON-WINDOWS APPLICATIONS
=========================================

This section describes some problems you might have running
non-Windows applications with Windows 3.0.

Microsoft Flight Simulator
--------------------------

Microsoft Flight Simulator cannot be run as a background application.
When you are running Windows in standard or real modes, do not switch
from Flight Simulator (ALT+TAB or ALT+ESC) to any other application.

Using MultiSoft PC-Kwik Disk Accelerator
----------------------------------------

If you use PC-Kwik with Windows running in 386 enhanced mode, make
sure the version is 3.55 or later and that you use PC-Kwik in extended
memory, not expanded memory.

If you need to upgrade your version of PC-Kwik, call MultiSoft at
1-800-888-KWIK in the United States. Outside the U.S., call
1-503-644-5644.

Professional Oracle
-------------------

You can run Oracle only in real mode, and without the HIMEM extended
memory driver loaded.

QModem
------

If you have problems running QModem with Windows, create a program
information file (PIF) for QModem that specifies a limit of 0 for EMS
memory. Specifying 0 disables EMS for QModem, freeing that memory for
use by Windows.

Borland Reflex
--------------

If you have performance problems running Borland Reflex with Windows
in 386 enhanced mode, include the following line in the [386Enh]
section of your SYSTEM.INI file:

  VirtualHDIrq=FALSE

Microsoft Word
--------------

You might have problems using ALT+TAB with Microsoft Word 5.0 and also
using ALT+SPACEBAR to transfer data into Microsoft Word 5.0 from the
Windows 3.0 Clipboard. If so, contact Microsoft Customer Service for
an updated version of Microsoft Word 5.0. The updated version contains
a keyboard driver that lets you use ALT+TAB and ALT+SPACEBAR.

Lotus 1-2-3
-----------

Some versions of Lotus 1-2-3 require you to insert a floppy disk that
contains a software "key". When running with Windows in 386 enhanced
mode, a "key" version of 1-2-3 might display an error message telling
you that the disk drive is not ready. Or, Windows might terminate
1-2-3 and display a message telling you that the application has
violated system integrity.  You can prevent these problems by doing
one of the following:

- Make sure no other non-Windows applications are running when
  you start 1-2-3.

  -or-

- Edit the PIF for 1-2-3, and check the "Execution: Exclusive" box.
