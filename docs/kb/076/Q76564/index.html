SUMMARY
=======

In the enhanced mode of the Microsoft Windows graphical environment, the virtual
communications device (VCD) assigns a physical communications (COM) port to a
virtual machine (VM) only when certain events occur. The text below lists these
events.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Windows enhanced mode, the VCD virtualizes and serializes the ownership of
physical COM ports. When a program running in a VM directly accesses one of the
I/O ports of a COM port (for example, COM1 corresponds to I/O ports 0x3F8
through 0x3FE), that VM may not necessarily own the physical port. The VM
communicates with a virtual COM port until the VCD assigns a physical port.

Seven conditions that cause the VCD to assign a physical COM port to a particular
VM are:

1. When an application reads or writes the Receive/Transmit buffer with the
  Divisor Latch Access Bit (80h) of the Line Control Register off.

2. When an application reads the Line Status Register more than once.

3. When an application reads the Modem Status Register more than once.

4. When an application writes to the Modem Control Register with the Loopback
  (10h) or Interrupt Enable (08h) bits on (simply changing the DTR or RTS line
  states does not cause VCD to assign a physical COM port).

5. When an application unmasks a COM port interrupt.

6. When a COM port interrupt occurs for an unowned COM port.

7. When the communications driver (COMM.DRV) instructs the VCD to assign a port
  to the Windows (system) VM because an application called the OpenComm
  function.

Implementation details on COM port assignment can be found by examining the
source code to VCD, which is available in the DDK. Some of the relevant
procedures are:
