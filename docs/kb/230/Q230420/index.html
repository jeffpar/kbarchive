X.400 Connector to the DMS version of Exchange Server as follows:

1. Select the "Use the GDI specified below" radio button.

2. The "PRMD (p)" option should be configured to correctly reflect the remote
  system's GDI settings.

3. In the ADMD (a) section, select Specific.

4. In the ADMD text box, type "DMS" (without the quotation marks).

5. In the Country/Region (c) section, select US (United States).
