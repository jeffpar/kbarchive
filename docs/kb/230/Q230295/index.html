Important   This README file provides useful information that may not be included in the online documentation. 

System Requirements 
Content Analyzer requires the following minimum software and hardware environment for optimal performance:

Hardware Requirements:

Pentium processor 
32 MB of memory is recommended (16 MB minimum) 
15 MB disk space for the program, documentation, and sample maps 
Internet connection (direct or modem) 
Software Requirements:

Microsoft(R) Windows NT(R) version 4.0 
An Internet browser 
Plug-in applications for multimedia (recommended) 
Publishing and authoring tools for editing resource files (recommended) 
Browser Compatibility

We've tested Content Analyzer with the most popular browsers. The following browsers have been verified to work with Content Analyzer:

Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.02 (or later) 
Netscape Navigator 3.0 (or later) 
If you're running previous versions of these products, we recommend that you upgrade to the newer versions. 

Configuring Content Analyzer to Work With Your Proxy Server

To configure Content Analyzer to be used in conjunction with an established proxy server, enter the appropriate information in the Proxy tab of the Content Analyzer View/Program Options dialog box. If you're not sure if you are using a proxy server, contact your system administrator. You may also need to ask your administrator for any required user name or password.

Known Issues

Please note the following known issues:

When mapping a site, Content Analyzer will access every URL within that site. This is equivalent to a user clicking on every link. If you have links to gateway scripts that have side effects (for example, manipulating records in a database), these will all be executed, potentially altering data stored outside of the HTML content of the site.
