-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you set up a rule in Microsoft Outlook by using the Rules Wizard or the Inbox
Assistant to forward incoming mail to another user, the following error message
may be displayed:

  RULES IN ERROR
  Rule: "&lt;name_of_rule&gt;"
  Error: Unknown Error

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the Exchange Server 5.5 post Service Pack 1 (SP1) fix
has been applied to the Exchange Server computer. The post-SP1 fix does not
handle forwarding rules in the client.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, click the following article number to
view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

STATUS
======

This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The error message is only displayed the first time that the rule starts. After
that, if you start Outlook as the user for whom the rule was created, the error
message is not displayed, but the rule does not work.

If you set diagnostic logging to maximum for rules on the private information
store, the following events are logged in the following sequence:

  Event ID: 1037
  Source: MSExchangeIS Private
  Type: Information
  Category: Rules
  Description: Triggering the rule (RuleName) with sequence number 2.
  The distinguished name of the owning mailbox is Admin Exchange 'ServerName'

  Event ID: 1045
  Source: MSExchangeIS Private
  Type: Information
  Category: Rules
  Description: Attempting to perform action 0 in rule ID 1-B9C. The type of
  action is Forward.

  Event ID: 1040
  Source: MSExchangeIS Private
  Type: Error
  Category: Rules
  Description: The rule (RuleName) with sequence number 2 is being disabled due
  to errors encountered while applying the rule. The distinguished name of the
  owning mailbox is Admin Exchange 'ServerName'
