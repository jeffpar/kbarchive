-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002 Professional Edition 
- Microsoft Motocross Madness, version 1.0 
- Microsoft Train Simulator, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start one of the products listed earlier, you may receive an
error message similar to the following:

  Could not find any 3D acceleration hardware on your system. Please make sure
  that your card is properly installed.

When you try to start Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002, it may only start in Safe
mode, and you may receive the following message:

  Safe mode has been enabled because your system is currently unable to use
  hardware acceleration.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if one of the following NeoMagic video adapters is
installed in your computer:

- NeoMagic MagicGraph 128XD
- NeoMagic MagicGraph 128ZV+
- NeoMagic MagicMedia 256AV
- NeoMagic MagicMedia 256XL+

MORE INFORMATION
================

While in Safe mode, you can run Flight Simulator and troubleshoot hardware
issues, but performance and display quality are affected. Product Support
Services does not support Safe mode. For more information, see the Readme file,
which is available from the Flight Simulator link in your windows Start menu.

Microsoft Motorcross Madness

These NeoMagic video adapters use software to emulate 3D acceleration and do not
support true Direct3D acceleration. As a result, Motocross Madness cannot detect
any of these video adapters.

Microsoft Train Simulator

Microsoft Train Simulator has detected that your graphics hardware may be lacking
essential features that it needs to run. Please ensure that you have the latest
drivers from your graphics card manufacturer's web site.

  -or-

When starting the Train Simulator Troubleshooter, you may see this message:

  Train simulator requires hardware acceleration.
