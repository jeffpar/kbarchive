The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0, 4.0 SP4

SUMMARY
=======

When users load the Windows NT Server 4.0 operating system on a computer, they
are asked to select from many installation options. In addition to the
selectable options offered during installation of the Windows NT Server 4.0
operating system, there are additional features of the Windows NT Server 4.0
product that may be installed on the target computer. These features have been
made available by Microsoft through service packs, the Windows NT Option Pack
and the Windows NT Server Web site.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Because users may have selected a variety of options and installed additional
features on a given system, all options and features must be considered when
assessing the computer's Year 2000 readiness status. For an installation of
Windows NT 4.0 to reach "Y2K compliant" status, Microsoft has created:

- Service Pack 5 (SP5) to help users address all the known Year 2000 compliance
  issues with their installations of Windows NT Server in a simple and
  automated fashion.

- Service Pack 4 (SP4), which addresses most known Year 2000 issues. However,
  users must update or upgrade certain features to newer versions, in addition
  to applying SP4. The Windows NT Server 4.0 features that must be updated or
  upgraded in addition to applying SP4, along with specific update/upgrade
  instructions:

   - Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC), multiple versions.

   - Microsoft Internet Explorer, multiple versions.


The Windows NT Server 4.0 optional features that must be updated or upgraded only
if previous versions exist on the computer are:

- Active Directory Services Interface, version 1.0

- Microsoft FrontPage 97

- Microsoft FrontPage 97 Server Extensions

- Microsoft Internet Locator Service, version 1.0

- Site Server Express, version 2.0

- Microsoft Transaction Server, version 1.0

- Microsoft Transaction Server, version 1.1

The installation of SP4 applies updates to the base Windows NT Server 4.0 product
including the installation options. Applying SP4 also updates certain Windows NT
Server 4.0 features. Users should also apply any Windows NT Year 2000 (Y2K)
Updates that have been made available post-SP4.

The current post-SP4 Y2K update can be obtained from:

  http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/nts/downloads/recommended/nt4y2kpostsp4/default.asp

For more information discussing the known Year 2000 issues that are addressed by
the current post-SP4 update, please see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
article:

Note that these updates and upgrades can be performed either before or after
applying SP4.
