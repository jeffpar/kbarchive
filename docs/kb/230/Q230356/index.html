SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to change the IP addresses of the network adapters in
the nodes of a cluster.

MORE INFORMATION
================

During this procedure, it is important that the cluster server maintain a
connection to the network. This is necessary so that it can communicate with a
domain controller to validate the cluster server Service account.

This article assumes that there are two nodes named A and B.

1. Change the IP address of the network adapter on node A. This may require the
  computer to be rebooted. If you are prompted to restart the computer, do so.

2. Start Cluster Administrator and open a connection to the cluster. To
  administer the cluster, you need to open a connection to "." (without
  quotation marks) in Cluster Administrator when you are prompted to do so. You
  must perform this process on one of the nodes in the cluster. If you do this
  remotely, it may be possible to open a connection to the name of the node
  itself. During this process, Cluster Administrator may respond with the
  following error message:

  A connection to the cluster at &lt;cluster name&gt; could not be opened. This
  may be caused by the Cluster Service on node &lt;cluster name&gt; not being
  started. Would you like Cluster Administrator to attempt to start the Cluster
  Service on node &lt;cluster name&gt;?

This occurs because Cluster Administrator attempts to connect to the last cluster
it administered.

3. Double-click the IP Address resource to open its properties.

4. On the Parameters tab in the IP Address resource properties, make sure that
  the "Network to Use" box contains the new network as the network to use.

5. Fail all groups over to the functional node A.

6. Change the IP addresses for the network adapters in node B.

7. Reboot the computer.

8. When both nodes agree on the subnets, the old networks disappear and the new
  networks are created.

9. You can rename the networks at this time.

You use "." to administer the cluster because the IP Address resource does not
come online when the Cluster service recognizes a new network and no longer uses
the old network.
