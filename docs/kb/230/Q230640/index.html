-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SQL 7.0 automatically grows a file when more space is needed. SMS 2.0 Setup
creates the SMS Database with this grow feature turned on, but it also sets a
restriction on the size of the file. This restriction can cause problems when
the database has grown to this size and cannot grow more. If the administrator
is not aware of this setting then this could be perceived as some other problem
and take time to diagnose and correct.

CAUSE
=====

SMS 2.0 Setup creates the SMS Database with File Properties:

- Automatically grow file

- Restrict filegrowth (MB)

"Automatically grow file" tells SQL to increase the database size as needed;
however, "Restrict filegrowth" keeps the file from growing larger then the size
entered.

This is a problem if the SQL Administrator is not aware that this limitation has
been set. The assumption is the database will grow as needed.

WORKAROUND
==========

There are two options for correcting this problem:

- Increase the maximum file size.

-or-

- Remove the file size restriction.

The maximum file size setting can be set in SQL Server Enterprise Manager using
the following steps:

1. Select the SQL Server containing your SMS Database.

2. Open the Database folder.

3. Click the SMS Database.

4. On the General tab, click database properties.

5. At the bottom of the Properties box, locate the Maximum file size.

6. Remove the restriction by selecting Unrestricted filegrowth.

7. Increase the Maximum file size by selecting Restrict filegrowth (MB), and
  entering the maximum size to allow.

STATUS
------

2.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. service pack for Systems
