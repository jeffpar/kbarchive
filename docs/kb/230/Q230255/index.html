-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

On Microsoft Windows NT-based clients that are using network discovery and
remote client installation, if you log off or reboot within 15 minutes of
logging on, the Wuser32 service hangs with an "End task" message. During this
time, the Systems Management Server (SMS) Remote Control service does not appear
in the Services tool in Control Panel, and the client cannot be remotely
controlled.

CAUSE
=====

The following text is an excerpt from a sample Wuser32.log file:

  Using security type 2
  Init TCPIP
  RegQueryValueEx of Verify Port returned 0
  RegQueryValueEx of View Port returned 0
  ** TCP Stream Viewee Thread starting
  ** Starting TCPStreamSendThread

  Initdialog!
  ghwndParent = 50080
  ghwndDlg = 40036
  ghwndInvisible = 30066
  Unable to lookup account name Administradores
  Unable to lookup account name Administrateurs
  Unable to lookup account name Administratoren
  Unable to lookup account name Administratorer
  Unable to lookup account name Administratrer
  Added Administrators. ACE count: 1 size: 4096
  Unable to lookup account name Amministratori
  Unable to lookup account name Beheerders
  Unable to lookup account name Jrjestelmnvalvojat
  Added DACL - ACE count: 1

This behavior can occur in a multiple-domain, multiple-full-trust environment
with Windows NT 3.51-based and 4.0-based primary domain controllers (PDCs). It
takes about one minute for each permitted viewer in the Permitted Viewers list
to be authenticated (or return from an unsuccessful authentication attempt). The
authentication process begins as soon as the Client agent starts, and spends one
minute on each entry in the Permitted Viewers list. This is an uncorrectable
problem with Windows NT when it creates Access Control Lists (ACLs) for user and
user group names in complex environments. Wuser32.exe is waiting for a Windows
NT-based API call for a return from the Windows NT domain authentication system.
The Wuser32 agent may seem to hang if a shutdown is performed during one of
these attempts to authenticate an ACL.

WORKAROUND
==========

Edit the Permitted Viewers list on the site server to remove unnecessary groups.
Add a domain name to each remaining user group by replacing "Administrators"
with "&lt;DOMAIN&gt;\Administrators"
. If you change the settings on the Advanced tab after the Remote Control Client
agent is installed on clients, the previously installed clients receive the new
settings during the next 23-hour Client Component Installation Manager (CCIM)
cycle.

If you have disabled security reconciliation on clients, you must manually update
the clients with the new settings. To do so, disable and re-enable Remote Tools
in the SMS Administrator console. After you disable Remote Tools, wait for all
clients to recognize the change and uninstall the Remote Control Client agent.
Then, re-enable Remote Tools in the SMS Administrator console. This method is
easy, but may not be suitable for many networks because of the brief loss of
Remote Tools functionality.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
