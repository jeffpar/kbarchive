SYMPTOMS
========

After you uninstall the Exchange SNADS Connector (SNADSC) from a site that has
multiple SNADSC, then you attempt to administer the remaining SNADSC in the same
site using the Exchange Server Administrator program, the following error
messages may occur:

  Extension 'lssnacp0' could not be loaded. The extension for Microsoft
  Exchange Administrator's CPU type has not been installed in the site.
  Microsoft Exchange Administrator ID no: c1031667

  Extension 'LSMSGTRK' could not be loaded. The extension for Microsoft Exchange
  Administrator's CPU type has not been installed in the site. Microsoft
  Exchange Administrator ID no: c1031667

  Extension 'LSQVIEW' could not be loaded. The extension for Microsoft Exchange
  Administrator's CPU type has not been installed in the site. Microsoft
  Exchange Administrator ID no: c1031667

Selecting Ignore on each error message opens the SNADSC property pages, however
the Options and the Message Tracking tabs will be missing. Moreover, the Queues
tab will only show two queues, the MTS-IN and the MTS-OUT queues.

CAUSE
=====

When one SNADSC is uninstalled from a site that inculdes several SNADSC, the
replication process removes the Exchange Server extensions supporting the SNADSC
from all Exchange servers in the site. Mail flow still works, but the above
error messages occur when you attempt to access the property page for the
SNADSC.

RESOLUTION
==========

To re-add these missing components, run the following commands from the
Exchsrvr\Connect\Exchconn\Install directory of an existing SNADS Connector
(substitute your Exchange Organization, Site, and Server names in the
appropriate places). These commands add these missing components and propagate
the components to the other servers in the site.

  mexiextn /org=&lt;ORG&gt; /site=&lt;SITE&gt; /server=&lt;SERVER&gt;
  /machine=i386 /name=LSMSGTRK
  /extdll=\\server\add-ins\lsmsgtrk\i386\lsmsgtrk.dll /display_name="Extension
  for Connectivity Message Tracking for i386"

  mexiextn /org=&lt;ORG&gt; /site=&lt;SITE&gt; /server=&lt;SERVER&gt;
  /machine=i386 /name=LSQVIEW /extdll=\\server\add-ins\lsqview\i386\lsqview.dll
  /display_name="Extension for Connectivity Queue Viewer for i386"

  mexiextn /org=&lt;ORG&gt; /site=&lt;SITE&gt; /server=&lt;SERVER&gt;
  /machine=i386 /name=LSNTSCP0
  /extdll=\\server\add-ins\lssnacp0\i386\lssnacp0.dll /display_name="Extension
  for SNADS Connector for i386"

After you run each command individually, review the Lmeilog.txt file in the same
directory, and look at the last entry to see if the command was successful.
Alternatively, in the Exchange Server Administrator program, select the Add-ins
container (press F5 to refresh), and see if the component now appears. If the
display name for the component does not appear in the list, the command was
unsuccessful.
