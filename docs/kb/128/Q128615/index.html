- Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running Windows 95 Setup on a Dell computer with a PCI bus, the
detection process may stop at 80 percent complete. When this occurs, you see the
error message "Divide By Zero."

If you restart the computer and use Safe Recovery to finish Setup, more than one
logical drive letter may be assigned to a single SCSI drive in the computer. For
example, when you try to access drive E you see the contents of drive C instead.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur on a Dell computer with a PCI bus and the following
configuration:

- The computer has a built-in NCR 810 SCSI controller without an external SCSI
  connection.

- The computer has a second SCSI controller connected to the same SCSI bus
  cable as the first SCSI controller. The connection path for the SCSI
  controllers and devices is as follows:

     Built-in SCSI controller
        |
     Internal devices attached to the built-in SCSI controller (such as
     logical drive C)
        |
     Second SCSI controller
        |
     External devices attached to the second SCSI controller

This connection path causes both controllers to drive the same SCSI bus,
resulting in the symptoms described above.


RESOLUTION
==========

Use either of the following methods to work around this problem:

- Disable the built-in SCSI controller and use the new controller for all the
  SCSI devices.

- Use the second SCSI controller only for external devices. Use the built-in
  SCSI controller only for internal devices. Do not connect the two SCSI
  controllers to the same SCSI bus.
