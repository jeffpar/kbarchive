The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual C++, version 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article lists the answers to the most frequently asked questions about
Visual C++ version 2.1 and lists the new features added to version 2.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. How do I get Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Edition, version 2.1?

  Purchase the Microsoft Visual C++ Subscription. If you have Visual C++ version
  2.0, you can purchase an upgrade to the subscription by mailing in the coupon
  in your version 2.0 box or by calling Microsoft at 800-426-9400. Otherwise,
  you can contact your nearest reseller.

  The subscription is available in the U.S., Canada, or Europe only. If you live
  outside these areas, you must purchase Visual C++ version 2.0 and contact
  your subsidiary for the upgrade.

2. When is it available?

  Subscribers started receiving it at the end of February 1995.

3. What is in it?

  The first subscription release of Visual C++. It adds new functionality to the
  Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) Library to support Windows 95, as well as
  Simple MAPI and Windows Sockets. It also adds new features to the OLE Control
  Developer's Kit (CDK) including the ability to use MFC database classes in
  OLE controls. Finally, the release includes new samples, documentation, and
  of course bug fixes. Review the rest of this article for more details.

4. I paid $199 for version 2.0, so why do I have to pay $199 again for the
  subscription?

  If you bought the version 2.0 subscription, you get version 2.0 and three
  releases (one year's worth). If you bought the subscription now, you get
  version 2.1 and three releases (one year's worth). On an ongoing basis the
  subscription will be $299 for a year, so you are receiving a discount because
  you bought version 2.0.

5. I just want bug fixes how do I get those?

  You need to buy the subscription to get the version 2.1 release. We will be
  following a pattern of three releases a year, generally one major release
  that will be available for purchase stand-alone and two other releases that
  will contain a variety of content and be available to just subscribers. Of
  course, if there is a bug that affects a large number of people, we will make
  it available free as a patch as we always have.

6. When is version 3.0 coming out?

  We do not discuss future releases.

7. Why isn't there a Macintosh or RISC subscription?

  Microsoft is investigating this. At this point, Macintosh or RISC products are
  lower volume products, and because this release focuses on Windows 95, it
  isn't a big issue as far as features.

8. Does Visual C++ version 2.1 still come with the 16-bit Visual C++?

  Yes, version 1.52 of 16-bit Visual C++ ships with the subscription update. We
  updated MFC with MAPI, WinSocket, and CPropertyPage/Sheet support and made
  several bug fixes.

9. Are you going to continue to bring 32-bit MFC features back to 16-bit MFC?

  In general our focus in on the 32-bit product and Win32 development. We have
  no further plans to update the 16-bit product beyond maintenance.

10. I've subscribed, why I haven't received it?

  Here are several possible reasons why:

   - You did not activate your subscription. You must send in the activation
     card that came in the box. You'll find it next to the MFC hierarchy chart.
     If you lost it, please call 800-719-5577 and have your Product ID number
     ready.

   - You live outside the United States or Canada. The Visual C++ Subscription
     is now being launched in Western Europe. As for other countries, we're
     working on it. Please understand that it takes time to get the
     subscription available everywhere, so this CD will be available as a
     standalone upgrade through your local subsidiary.

   - You bought the non-subscription edition. If you live in the U.S. or
     Canada, you can upgrade to Visual C++ Subscription by sending in the
     upgrade card in the box. If you lost the card, please call Microsoft at
     1-800-719-5577 to order the Subscription.

   - Something else went wrong. Please call Microsoft at 1-800-719-5577 with
     your Product ID number and we'll try to work things out.

WHAT'S NEW IN VISUAL C++ VERSION 2.1
------------------------------------

Additions to Editors and Wizards
--------------------------------

The following features are new to the editors and wizards in Visual C++ for
Windows NT Version 2.1:

- Dialog editor support for new Windows Common Controls. You can add spin-
  button, tab, tree view, and other Common Controls to dialog boxes in your
  Windows 95 applications (and in applications for future versions of Windows
  NT). If you want to add Windows Common Controls to your application, you must
  be running under the same operating system on which the target application
  will run. For example, you can develop an application under Windows NT
  version 3.5 that will run on Windows 95, but you cannot include Windows
  Common Controls.

- ClassWizard support for new Windows Common Controls. Map control notification
  messages to MFC handler functions, and add classes derived from Windows
  Common Control classes. ClassWizard's improved layout makes these tasks
  easier.

- AppWizard support for Simple MAPI (the Windows Messaging API) and Windows
  Sockets.

- Complete AppWizard support for OLE Automation in a dynamic-link library
  (DLL).

- AppWizard support for creating a USRDLL project. AppWizard can now provide
  you with a skeleton CWinApp-derived object, rather than a DllMain function as
  it does when creating an MFC Extension DLL.

New features in 32-bit MFC
--------------------------

The following features have been added to MFC in the 32-bit product:

- New Windows Common Control classes. Currently you can use these controls only
  in applications that will run under Windows 95. They will also be supported
  by future versions of Windows NT (starting with Windows NT version 3.51) and
  Win32s.

- Support for Simple MAPI, the Windows Messaging API, in classes CDocument and
  COleDocument.

- Windows Sockets classes for network programming (CAsyncSocket, CSocket, and
  CSocketFile).

- New 32-bit Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) drivers for use with the MFC
  database classes.

This release also contains Visual C++ version 1.52, an update to version 1.51,
which shipped with Visual C++ version 2.0. Visual C++ version 1.52 runs on
Windows version 3.1 or higher and Windows NT version 3.5 and includes the 16-bit
MFC version 2.52. The following features have been added to Visual C++ for
Windows version 1.52:

- Besides OLE and database classes, this version includes classes for OLE
  control development. It also includes a number of new MFC 2.52 classes ported
  from the 32-bit product.

- Like the 32-bit product, new features in MFC 2.52 include: Support for Simple
  MAPI in classes CDocument and COleDocument, Windows Sockets classes for
  network programming, and new 16-bit ODBC drivers for use with the MFC
  database classes.

- In addition, the 16-bit version now includes CPropertySheet and CPropertyPage
  -- MFC classes that support "tab dialog boxes" [ASCII 151] known as "property
  sheets" in MFC. Previously, these were only available in 32-bit Visual C++
  2.0.

New to the OLE Control Developer's Kit (CDK)
--------------------------------------------

The following features have been added to the CDK:

- Support for using the MFC database classes in OLE controls. This allows you
  to create data access controls using the CDatabase and CRecordset classes.
  The database support also includes a sample program, called DB, which
  illustrates the use of the MFC ODBC database classes in an OLE control.

- OLE controls that work under Win32s.

- Performance improvements, particularly in the areas of control creation and
  property access.

- Support for "grab handles" when controls are active.

Bug fixes and information
-------------------------

The product contains several new samples, technical articles and bug fixes for
Visual C++ versions 1.5 and 2.0 and for the OLE Control Developer's Kit.
