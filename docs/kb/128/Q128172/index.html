-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, version 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Microsoft Visual Basic application attempting to use the SPlusReadAppt
function will not retrieve the creator of an appointment.

CAUSE
=====

For developing applications in Visual Basic, the Schedule Access Libraries (SAL)
includes the SPlusReadAppt function, which is declared in the module file
SPLUS.BAS to make calls to the library SPLUS.DLL. SPlusReadAppt makes calls to
functions BPLUSReadAppt() and BPLUSGetReadAppt().

The call to BPLUSGetReadAppt() function should return a type (structure) of
SPlusAppt that includes a reference to the creator type. However, the creator
type is not correctly returned. The creator information can be accessed by an
application built with the C interface to SPLUS.DLL.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 1.0a of Microsoft
Schedule+ for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Not every appointment will have a creator associated with it. The creator
information is included when the appointment is created by a user who is not the
owner of the calendar file. This can only happen when another user has been
given create or assistant rights by the owner of the calendar. When these users
create appointments on calendars other than their own, they are recorded as the
creator.
