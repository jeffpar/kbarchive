The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use "File and printer sharing for Microsoft Networks" or "File and
printer sharing for NetWare Networks" on a Windows 95-based computer, remote
users may be able to gain access to your entire hard disk.

When you share a folder on a Windows 95-based computer, users on UNIX- based
computers running the SMBCLIENT Samba network client who connect to the shared
folder may be able to gain access to the entire drive on which the shared folder
is located.

CAUSE
=====

You may experience this problem with "File and printer sharing for NetWare
Networks" or with "File and printer sharing for Microsoft Networks" when the
following conditions are met.

File and Printer Sharing for NetWare Networks (Nwserver.vxd):

- Your workstation is configured to share files and printers with "File and
  printer sharing for NetWare Networks."

- Remote administration or the Microsoft Remote Registry service is enabled.

  NOTE: These options are not enabled by default.

File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks (Vserver.vxd):

- Your workstation is configured to share files and printers with "File and
  printer sharing for Microsoft Networks."

- Your workstation connects to a LAN, Internet (SLIP or PPP account), or
  Dial-Up Networking connection that can be accessed by UNIX-based computers
  running the SMBCLIENT Samba network client.

- The network administrator does not disable peer services using System
  Policies.

The SMBCLIENT Samba network client allows users to send illegal networking
commands over the network. At this time, the Samba client is the only known
SMBCLIENT that does not filter out such illegal commands. SMBCLIENT users do not
automatically gain access to the Windows 95 drive; these users must know the
exact steps to send these illegal commands.


RESOLUTION
==========

To prevent these illegal commands from being run on a Windows 95 computer,
Microsoft has released new versions of the Nwserver.vxd (4.00.951) and
Vserver.vxd (4.00.952) files. These files are available in the Microsoft Windows
95 Service Pack 1 Update Setup.exe file.

For information about Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q142794 Availability of Microsoft Windows 95 Service Pack 1

Installation
------------

To install this update, follow these steps:

1. Download the Setup.exe file from the Microsoft Download Center to an empty
  folder.

2. In My Computer or Windows Explorer, double-click the Setup.exe file you
  downloaded in step 1.

3. Follow the instructions on the screen.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:
