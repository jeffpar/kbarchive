-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Schedule+ for Windows, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Duplicate appointments may start appear in the Schedule+ user's calendar file.
This can occur in both the Server calendar file (MAILDATA\CAL\HEXID.CAL) or
Off-Line calendar file (LocalPath=C:\&lt;path&gt;\USERNAME.CAL parameter in the
SCHDPLUS.INI file).

RESOLUTION
==========

1. From the Windows directory, open the user's SCHDPLUS.INI file.

2. Under the [Microsoft Schedule+] heading, add the following line:

  StartupOffline=1

3. Save the changes and close the SCHDPLUS.INI file.

4. Start Schedule+.


5. Delete the duplicate appointments from the local file.

6. From the File menu, select Export Appointments. Export the user's calendar
  file information into a USERNAME.SCH file.

7. Delete or rename the user's local (C:\&lt;path&gt;\username.cal) and Server's
  MAILDATA\CAL\HEXID.CAL calendar copies.


NOTE: A user's online calendar file is not named with the same eight- digit ID
number as the user's mail message file (.MMF), nor is it named with the user's
name for security reasons. You can use either the MVCAL or the DUMPKEY utility
to locate a specific user's online calendar file.

Using MVCAL.EXE
---------------

This utility will find the calendar file for the user name specified, and rename
it to &lt;username&gt;.BAD. After the calendar file is renamed, a new file will
be created the next time the user signs in. This new calendar file will be
created from the user's local calendar file.

To use this utility, from where MVCAL.EXE is stored, type:

  "mvcal &lt;username&gt; [-d&lt;drive&gt; -p&lt;password&gt;]" (without the
  quotation marks)

where:

  &lt;username&gt; is the user with the corrupt calendar file.

  &lt;drive&gt; is the path to the Mail database (the default is M).

  &lt;password&gt; is the password for the Schedule+ Administrator (not the Mail
  Administrator).

Using DUMPKEY.EXE
-----------------

To use this utility, use the following MS-DOS command to copy the DUMPKEY.EXE
file to the CAL directory of the postoffice (this assumes that the Mail database
is located on drive M):

copy dumpkey.exe m:\cal\dumpkey.exe

From the MAILDATA\CAL directory, type:

  dumpkey schedule.key &gt; calfiles.txt

(This will redirect the output to a file called CALFILES.TXT for easy viewing.)

1. Have the user login to Schedule+. This will create new server and local
  calendar files.

2. From the File menu, select Import Appointments. Import the appointments from
  the USERNAME.SCH file created in step 6.

MORE INFORMATION
================


When a user makes a change to the local calendar file, the change is copied to
the user's calendar file on the server when logging onto the server during the
synchronization process. The complete server calendar file is then copied down
to the local file.

NOTE: If the users manually copy the local file up to the server, the calendar
file synchronization process can get into an endless loop, starting the
duplication of appointments.

If the network operating system is Novell, ensure that users have FileScan rights
to MAILDATA\CAL. For additional information, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
