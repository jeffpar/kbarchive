-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.1, 3.5 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.1, 3.5 
- Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server, version 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Microsoft Mail version 3.2 and run the MS-DOS Message Transfer
Agent (EXTERNAL.EXE) in Windows NT, the computer system clock increments by 24
hours.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs if the BIOS type of the computer is not detected properly.
This problem may occur on any network operating system that is running the
MS-DOS Message Transfer Agent and the Postoffice is located on the system.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, do one of the following:

- Make sure the following entry in the EXTERNAL.INI file for Mail version 3.2x
  is set as follows:

     ClockRollOver=0

- From the MS-DOS Command Prompt, run EXTERNAL.EXE with the /ClockRollOver
  switch as follows

     EXTERNAL /ClockRollOver=0

NOTE: The ClockRollOver value is set to 1 by default. If you set this value to 0,
EXTERNAL does not attempt to read the system BIOS.

MORE INFORMATION
================

EXTERNAL.EXE version 3.2.13 or later is required to correct this problem.

To update your MS-DOS EXTERNAL.EXE file
---------------------------------------

1. You can find EXTUPD.EXE, a self-extracting file, on the following services:

   - Microsoft's World Wide Web Site on the Internet On the www.microsoft.com
     home page, click the Support icon. Click Knowledge Base, and select the
     product. Enter kbfile EXTUPD.EXE, and click GO! Open the article, and
     click the button to download the file.

   - Internet (anonymous FTP) ftp ftp.microsoft.com Change to the
     Softlib/Mslfiles folder. Get EXTUPD.EXE


For additional information about downloading, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services


2. After you download EXTUPD.EXE to an empty directory, run it (by typing
  "extupd" at the MS-DOS prompt) to extract the contents of the file. You
  should receive the following files:

     ASYNC.OVL    (371,898 bytes, dated 12/01/94, 6:01 P.M.)
     EXTERNAL.EXE  (57,535 bytes, dated 12/01/94, 5:46 P.M.)
     X25ATLAN.OVL (376,890 bytes, dated 12/01/94, 6:06 P.M.)
     X25EICON.OVL (395,898 bytes, dated 12/01/94, 6:09 P.M.)
     README.TXT

3. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following (pressing ENTER after each
  line)

     copy &lt;path&gt;:\external.exe &lt;destination&gt;
     copy &lt;path&gt;:\*.ovl &lt;destination&gt;

  where &lt;path&gt; is the drive and directory where you ran the self-
  extracting EXTUPD.EXE file and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory
  where your EXTERNAL.EXE and *.OVL files currently reside. For example, if you
  ran the self-extracting file from the TEST directory on drive D, and your
  EXTERNAL.EXE and *.OVL files are located in the MAILEXE directory on drive C,
  type the following commands:

     copy d:\test\external.exe c:\mailexe
     copy d:\test\*.ovl c:\mailexe

  NOTE: The EXTERNAL.EXE and *.OVL files typically reside on the postoffice
  server in the Mail executables directory, as well as on the machine
  transferring messages to and from the database. Make sure you update all
  copies of the EXTERNAL.EXE and *.OVL files.

NOTE: When operating a message transfer agent on Windows NT, Microsoft recommends
that you use the Windows Mail 3.5 Multitasking Message Transfer agent. Microsoft
does not endorse the use of the MS-DOS Message Transfer Agent on Windows NT.
