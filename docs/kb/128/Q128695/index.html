SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Windows, you receive the following error message:

  Could not read the file C:\TABWORKS\DEFAULT.TWF

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs when you are using TabWorks instead of Program Manager as the
Windows shell and there is a problem with the DEFAULT.TWF file. The file may be
missing or damaged, or it may have been moved to another directory.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use one of the following methods to work around this problem:

Method 1
--------

Use Program Manager instead of TabWorks for the Windows shell. To do so, quit
Windows and edit the SYSTEM.INI file. Change the SHELL= line to read:

  shell=progman.exe

Method 2
--------

Rebuild the default TabWorks book so that tabs and icons appear correctly. To do
so, follow these steps:

1. From the TabWorks File menu, choose New Book. When you are prompted to save
  changes to untitled, choose No.

2. When you are prompted "Do you wish to create tabs from your existing Program
  Manager groups?" choose Yes. TabWorks creates a new default book.

3. If the fonts in the new book are legible, skip this step. If the fonts are
  not legible, change the tab font by choosing Options, then Font, then Tab
  Font.

4. Quit Windows. When you are prompted for a name for the new file, name it
  anything but DEFAULT.TWF (but make sure to give the file a .TWF extension).
  The name of the new file replaces the reference to DEFAULT.TWF in the
  [Binder] section of the TABWORKS.INI file.

5. Restart Windows.

MORE INFORMATION
================

TabWorks is software published by Xerox and sold through Compaq that replaces
Program Manager as the Windows shell. A TabWorks book is a saved file containing
the information that formats and sorts groups (or "tabs") and icons within the
tabs. The DEFAULT.TWF file stores the information that loads the default book
when TabWorks starts. This file is located in the TabWorks directory and is
referenced in the TABWORKS.INI file.

A new version of TabWorks, version 1.1, is available from Compaq. The new version
automatically creates a backup DEFAULT.TWF file in case the original one is
damaged.

For more information about TabWorks, contact XSoft.
