The information in this article applies to:

- Scholastic's Magic School Bus series: Explores the Solar System for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you get to the classroom in Magic School Bus Explores the Human Body or the
Solar System, your computer may hang (stop responding) if you are using a
Gateway 2000 computer that has the following configuration:

- 4 megabytes (MB) of RAM (Note that this problem may also occur after you play
  and win games if you have 8 MB RAM instead of 4 MB of RAM.)

- 486 processor

- VGA CLGD54xx video chipset

- Gateway 2000 Audio Driver chip version 1.20.xx_16 AZI Labs

Note that this problem may occur inconsistently.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, update to the latest version of the Gateway 2000 Audio
Driver.

If you have version 1.20.xx of the Gateway 2000 Audio Driver, call Gateway at
(800) 846-2301 to obtain version 1.43 or later. If you have a modem, you can
download the driver by calling Gateway's Bulletin Board Service (BBS) at (800)
846-7562. To install the new sound driver, follow the instructions provided by
Gateway.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To find out which version of the sound driver you have, use the following
steps:

1. In the Main group of Program Manager, double-click the Control Panel icon,
  and then double-click the Drivers icon.

2. From the list of Installed Drivers, select Gateway Audio and choose Setup.

3. Click the Info button on the settings panel to display information about your
  currently installed Gateway 2000 Audio Driver.
