SYMPTOMS
========

Porting your 16-bit application to Win32 results in LINK error LNK2001
(unresolved externals), if a __cdecl function is exported using a module-
definition (.DEF) file. The error specifies the function as defined in the .DEF
file, with the leading underscore (_) in the name.

CAUSE
=====

In 16-bit code, functions are either declared with the __cdecl, __pascal, or
__fastcall conventions. The linker should not resolve a call to a __cdecl
function with a __pascal function, therefore, the compiler decorates __cdecl
names with a leading underscore, converts __pascal names to all caps, and
decorates __fastcall functions with a leading at symbol (@), so the linker will
not make this mistake. It is a requirement that you put the decorated name in
the .DEF file.

In 32-bit code for the x86, functions are either declared with the __cdecl,
__stdcall, or __fastcall conventions. The compiler decorates __cdecl names with
a leading underscore, __stdcall names with a leading underscore and an appended
@N (where N is the number of bytes in the parameter list), and __fastcall names
with a leading at symbol (@) and an appended @N (where N is the number of bytes
in the parameter list).

The 32-bit linker uses a different method to resolve function calls, so a single
.DEF file can be compatible across all Win32 platforms, including RISC, where
the names are not decorated in a similar manner. You specify the undecorated
name in the .DEF file and pass the object file(s) to the linker when building
the import library. The linker will do a fuzzy lookup, comparing the undecorated
names to the decorated names in the object file to find a match.

In the case mentioned in the Symptoms section of this article, the function name
already has the leading underscore, whereas the linker is expecting an
undecorated name. Suppose the function is MyFunc and the .DEF file contains
_MyFunc. The decorated name is _MyFunc, but the linker searches for __MyFunc,
__MyFunc@N, and @_MyFunc@N and cannot resolve the reference.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around the problem, update your .DEF file by removing the underscore at
the beginning of the file name. If you are maintaining the same source code with
both Visual C++ for Windows and Visual C++ 32-bit Edition, you must use two .MAK
(project) files and two .DEF files, one for each environment. However, the one
32-bit .DEF file will work across all Win32 platforms.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
