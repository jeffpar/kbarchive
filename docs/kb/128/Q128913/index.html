The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.0, 3.2, 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Mail for PC Networks EXTERNAL.EXE program creates .0LK and .PBB
files when transferring mail via asynchronous (async) or X.25 communication
links. This article provides an explanation of these files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A Microsoft Mail for PC Networks mail system may contain more than one
EXTERNAL.EXE to send mail to either a remote user or an external postoffice.
Likewise, multiple EXTERNAL.EXE programs may serve identical functions (for
example, operate against the same group of postoffices or remote users). If more
than one EXTERNAL.EXE is used against the same postoffices, the programs must be
able to access and generate mail items without conflicting with one another.

The .0LK file is used to control access to a specific mail outbound queue, and
the .PBB file is used to ensure that the same mail item can be sent to multiple
destinations by different Externals at the same time.

OLK Files
---------

For outbound mail, EXTERNAL.EXE "locks" the mailbag containing the outbound mail
by creating a semaphore file in the P1 subdirectory. The creation and use of
semaphore files in the P1 subdirectory keeps multiple EXTERNAL.EXE programs from
trying to do the same operation against the same mailbag. Only the EXTERNAL.EXE
that currently owns the lock file can send outbound mail from the mailbag. When
the session is completed, the lock is removed.

The semaphore locking mechanism is a three step process. The first step is the
creation of a file with the mailbag name for a prefix, and .0LK for a suffix.
The file is created in the P1 subdirectory. The second step is to verify that
there are no older types of lock files. The third step is to open the file with
read/write, deny-all permissions. If these steps succeed, the EXTERNAL.EXE
program can service the mailbag. When the session is complete, the file is
closed and deleted.

If the lock file is stranded for any reason (system hang, machine rebooted in
middle of session, etc.), this file-stranding event does not automatically
create a problem. This will depend on the status of the file at the server.

The existence of the file is not a problem in itself, because the next
EXTERNAL.EXE to attempt a lock may be able to open the stranded semaphore lock
file, perform the mail transfer operations, and remove the semaphore file when
finished. If none of the External programs can use the lock file, it will have
to be manually closed through the server administrative functions.

PBB Files
---------

For each message, only one .MAI file is created. Therefore, even though a single
message may be sent to many users, only one .MAI file has been created for that
message. When multiple EXTERNAL.EXE programs deliver the same mail message from
a single postoffice to different users (either different remote users or
different postoffices), each EXTERNAL.EXE program references that single .MAI
file from each of the remote users (or postoffices) individual mailbag files.
For example, Remote User One and Remote User Two, each have their own mailbag
file. Both of those mailbag files point to a single .MAI message file. Because
each remote user has his or her own mailbag, two separate EXTERNAL.EXE programs
may deliver that single message to both users at the same time.

To send that single message to each remote user or postoffice, the EXTERNAL.EXE
program must generate a file containing the addressing information for that .MAI
message file. Each instance of EXTERNAL.EXE must generate a unique
addressing-information file for each remote user or postoffice.

These unique addressing-information files have the format of XXXXXXXX.PBB where
XXXXXXXX is the hexadecimal identifier (hex-id) of the .MAI file and the BB is a
two letter identifier generated as described in the following paragraphs. An
example of such a file is 000005AF.PBB. EXTERNAL.EXE generates and places the
PBB files in the P1 subdirectory of the postoffice.

During a remote or dispatch session, EXTERNAL.EXE generates a unique P1 Locking
ID or extension before generating any outgoing mail. It does this via an
algorithm that tries to create a file LOCKP1ID.xxx, where xxx is an extension
that can be anything from .PBB to .PZZ. If LOCKP1ID.PBB is already in use, an
attempt to create "LOCKP1ID.PBC" is done. If this cannot be done, then the
extension is again incremented until all possibilities are exhausted. There are
at least 500 possible combinations, so the probability of that many concurrent
sessions occurring is incredibly small.

Once the P1 lock (that is, extension) is generated for the session, EXTERNAL.EXE
uses it for the filename extension for generating the addressing-information
file. This allows for multiple EXTERNAL.EXEs to dispatch the same piece of mail
to multiple remote recipients. You will get filenames like xxx.PBB and xxx.PBC
for the same piece of outgoing mail if a concurrent transmission is occurring
(the prefix will be the same as the .MAI).

When the session is complete, EXTERNAL.EXE will clean up by deleting any
generated files, including the lock file(s).
