SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the Project Manager's Files tab and the Files tab
capabilities (sorting, including files, excluding files, and setting Code
Pages). You'll find the Files tab in the Project Manager's "Project Information"
dialog.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To get to the Project Manager's Files tab, open an existing project such as
TASTRADE.PJX, which you'll find in the \VFP\SAMPLES\MAINSAMP subdirectory. Then
either choose Project Information from the Project menu, or click the right
mouse button anywhere over the Project Manager.

The Project Information dialog is a tabbed dialog. The second Tab is the Files
option; choose it to bring it forward. The Files dialog is a summary listing of
all the files used by the project.

In the Files tab, there are five columns titled, left to right:

  Type
  Name
  Last Modified
  Included
  Code Page

These columns are sizable. To size a column, place the mouse pointer (cursor) on
the indented line that separates the two column headers. The pointer should
change shapes to become a left and right pointing arrow. Click and hold the left
mouse button as you drag to the left or the right. The columns will adjust
accordingly.

The columns are also sortable in either ascending or descending order. Click a
column header to sort the column in ascending order, or hold down the CTRL key
as you click the column header, to sort the column in descending order. The Code
Page Column, however, is not sortable.

You can also use the Files dialog to mark and unmark files for inclusion in the
project. To do this, click the check box in the Include column or use the Right
Mouse menu options. If a box is checked, the file will be included or compiled
into the project.

To set the Main program and Code Pages, use the Right mouse menu options. The
Main program is shown as a solid black box in the Include column.

The Code Page and Set Main options are enabled only if an appropriate file type
is currently selected. For example, if a table is the currently selected file
and a Right mouse click is executed, the Set Main option is not enabled.
