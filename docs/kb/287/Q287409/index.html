-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the site attachment process occurs between one primary site to another, the
new child primary site forwards all of its client hardware inventory to the new
parent primary site, along with other various configuration information about
itself.

When this process is complete, you can open the Resource Explorer in the Systems
Management Server (SMS) administrators console at the parent primary site. When
you view a computer that belongs to the child primary site under Workstation
Status in Resource Explorer, you may observe that the last hardware scan date
has been incremented by one month.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
the Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4 Hotfix Rollup Package (HRP).

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem does not affect the clients. As the clients report their next
regularly scheduled inventory, the new and accurate hardware scan time is
propagated to the clients' assigned sites and to all of the sites above it in
the SMS hierarchy.

The SMS command-line utility (Preinst.exe) with the /syncparent switch can also
demonstrate the same problem.
