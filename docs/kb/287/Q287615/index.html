The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Remote Tools Client Agent is verified on its 30-day Systems Management
Server (SMS) verification cycle, the Remctrl.exe component verify operation
causes a PendingFileRenameOperation for the Kbstuff.sys remote control driver.

CAUSE
=====

The remote control verification process attempts to replace Kbstuff.sys even if
the file exists and is the same version as the one that is contained in
Remctrl.exe.


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The PendingFileRenameOperation itself will have no adverse effects on the remote
tools operation. The operation just means that during the Remote Tools Client
Agent verification cycle, Remctrl.exe attempted to replace Kbstuff.sys. Because
Kbstuff.sys is a Microsoft Windows NT driver and is started automatically, the
file is in use when the attempt to replace it is made. Because of this, the
replacement of the Kbstuff.sys file waits until the computer is rebooted.

However, certain other software operations can be hindered by this
PendingFileRenameOperation. During some software installation procedures, the
software vendor may detect a PendingfileRenameOperation is in progress and
require the computer to be rebooted and the operation completed before the
software can be installed.
