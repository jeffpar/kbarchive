error message that is described in this section.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the following key is either corrupted or missing from
the registry in the Systems Management Server (SMS) site computer or server
computer:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\NAL\SERVER

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, use any of the workarounds described in this section.
Try these workarounds in the order in which they are listed in this article.

Workaround One
--------------

Reapply the SMS service pack that you are currently running to the site server
again. When you do so, the corrupted or missing registry key is re-created.

Workaround Two
--------------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Manually recreate the registry key:

1. Stop the sms_site_component_manager and sms_executive services.

2. Add a REG_MULTI_SZ value named "Active Order" to the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Nal\Server\Providers

  NOTE: This value must have the following string values:

   - LOCAL
   - MSWNET
   - NWNDS
   - NWBIND

3. Run the regsvr32 -u command on the following files to unregister the current
  dynamic-link library (DLL) files.

   - Abnwsvr.dll
   - Falsvrn.dll
   - Mslmsvrn.dll
   - Ndssvrn.dll
   - Bindsvrn.dll

4. Run the regsv32 command on the following files in the order they are listed
  to reregister the DLL files.

   - Abnwsvr.dll
   - Falsvrn.dll
   - Mslmsvrn.dll
   - Ndssvrn.dll
   - Bindsvrn.dll

  NOTE: These DLL files are located in the Sms\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder,
  where &lt;Platform&gt; is either Alpha or I386. Reregister all the DLL files.
  The NetWare DLL files are not invoked if NetWare redirectors do not exist on
  the computer.

5. Restart the sms_site_component_manager and the sms_executive services.

Workaround Three
----------------

Rebuild the site server or site system that is experiencing the issue.
