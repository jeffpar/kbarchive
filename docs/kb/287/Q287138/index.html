IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Microsoft eMbedded Visual Tools (eVT) 3.0 on a system that is
running Windows 98 Second Edition, the installation may fail with the following
error message:

  eMbedded Visual Tools 3.0 requires that Windows 98 Second Edition be
  installed.
  This is available at &lt;http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com&gt;.
  Would you like to install Windows 98 Second Edition now?

The setup program does not detect that you have already upgraded to Windows 98
Second Edition.

CAUSE
=====

eVT 3.0 can be installed on a Windows 98-based computer only if the computer has
been upgraded to Windows 98 Second Edition. However, when you upgrade to Windows
98 Second Edition, the upgrade does not update the registry value that the eVT
3.0 installation uses to determine whether the system has been upgraded to SE.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this problem, after you apply the Windows 98 Second Edition upgrade,
modify the registry to reflect the correct value as follows:

1. On the Start menu, click Run, and then type "regedit" (without the quotation
  marks) to start Registry Editor.

2. Locate the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion

3. Locate the VersionNumber value.

4. Change the value from 4.10.1998 to 4.10.2222.

5. Install eVT 3.0
