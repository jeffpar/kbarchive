The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You use Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to add a TN3270 workstation to
a Host Integration Server 2000 configuration, but the attempt fails and no error
message is returned.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

+---------------------------------+
| File name  | Date       | Time  | 
+---------------------------------+
| Wmisna.dll | 03/26/2001 | 16:56 | 
+---------------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Host Integration
Server 2000.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following script is an example of how TN370 workstation information can be
added to a Host Integration Server 2000 configuration through the use of WMI.
This code will fail, however, unless the fix described in the "Resolution"
section of this article is applied first.

  Set WmiLocator = CreateObject("WbemScripting.SWBemLocator")
  Set WmiNameSpace = WmiLocator.ConnectServer("","root\MicrosoftHis")
  Set WmiObj = WmiNameSpace.Get("MsSna_TN3270SessionIPFilter")
  WmiObj.Security_.impersonationLevel = 3
  Set NewWmiObj = WmiObj.SpawnInstance_

  NewWmiObj.Name="workstation1"
  NewWmiObj.Session="TN004"
  NewWmiObj.Put_ wbemFlagReturnWhenComplete
