The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Passport, versions 1.4, 1.99, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To enable the new features for Passport Sign In with the Microsoft Windows XP
operating system, such as the locally served credentials user interface, you
must use the new methods for authentication.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Passport methods that generated URLs for the Login server (such as LogoTag and
AuthURL) have been superseded by newer APIs: LogoTag2, LoginUser and AuthURL2.
(The older methods are still accessible but are being deprecated.) For more
information, see the following Passport Software Development Kit (SDK) Web
site:

  http://www.passport.com/sdkdocuments/sdk14/

Calls to LogoTag should be made instead to the LogoTag2 method. For more
information, see the following Passport Software Development Kit (SDK) Web
site:

  LogoTag2
  http://www.passport.com/sdkdocuments/sdk14/reference/scriptreference/ifaces/ipassportmanager2/logotag2.htm

The syntax and signature for LogoTag2 are the same as for LogoTag. The only
change that must be made to existing implementations is to change the method
name in the call.

Calls to AuthURL should be made instead to the AuthURL2 method. For more
information, see the following Passport SDK Web site:

  AuthURL2
  http://www.passport.com/sdkdocuments/sdk14/Reference/scriptreference/ifaces/ipassportmanager2/authurl2.htm

The syntax and signature for AuthURL2 are the same as for AuthURL. The only
change that must be made to existing implementations is to change the method
name in the call.

The LoginUser method logs the user on, either by outputting a 302 redirect URL,
or initiating a Passport-aware client authentication exchange. The LoginUser
method supports Passport-aware client applications and the credentials manager
as used in the Windows XP operating system. For more information, see the
following Passport SDK Web site:

  LoginUser
  http://www.passport.com/sdkdocuments/sdk14/Reference/scriptreference/ifaces/ipassportmanager2/loginuser.htm
