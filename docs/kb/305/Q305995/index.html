IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs.

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use Data Access Objects (DAO) to connect to a Microsoft Jet
database on a Novell fileserver, you may receive the following error message:

  3050 Could not lock file.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Novell fileservers have a maximum number of locks
setting, and Jet may use a high number locks when it reads or writes an .mdb
file.

RESOLUTION
==========

There are several ways to work around this behavior:

- Use Regedit.exe or Regedt32.exe to edit the Windows Registry, and permanently
  change the MaxLocksPerFile value.

- Use the SetOption method of the DBEngine object to temporarily change the
  MaxLocksPerFile value in the code.

Method 1: Change MaxLocksPerFile in the Windows Registry:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. From the Windows Start menu, click Run, type "Regedt32.exe" (without the
  quotation marks), and then click OK to start Registry Editor.

2. Locate the MaxLocksPerFile value under the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Jet\4.0\Engines\Jet 4.0

  NOTE: If the MaxLocksPerFile value does not exist, you must create it.

3. Decrease the MaxLocksPerFile value.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

NOTE: This method changes the Windows Registry setting for all applications that
use the Microsoft Jet database engine version 4.0.

Method 2: Use SetOption to Change MaxLocksPerFile Temporarily:

The SetOption method temporarily overrides values for the Microsoft Jet database
engine keys in the Windows Registry. The new value remains in effect until you
change it again or until the DBEngine object is closed.

The following code sample sets MaxLocksPerFile to 128 before it runs an update
operation inside a transaction:

  Sub MDBUpdate()
     On Error GoTo MDBUpdate_Error
     Dim db As DAO.Database, ws As DAO.Workspace

     ' Set MaxLocksPerFile.
     DBEngine.SetOption dbMaxLocksPerFile, 128

     Set db = CurrentDb
     Set ws = Workspaces(0)

     ' Perform the update.
     ws.BeginTrans
     db.Execute "UPDATE TableName SET Field1 = 'Updated Field'", _
           dbFailOnError

     ws.CommitTrans

     db.Close
     MsgBox "Done!"
     Exit Sub

  MDBUpdate_Error:
     MsgBox Err &amp; " " &amp; Error
     ws.Rollback
     MsgBox "Operation Failed - Update Canceled"
  End Sub

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
