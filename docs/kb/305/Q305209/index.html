Version(s): 2.0 SP3

Last Modified: 06-AUG-2002

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot upgrade a Systems Management Server (SMS) 1.2 client to SMS 2.0 if
any software on the client uses the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\INTEL\LANDesk
registry key. This may prevent migration for SMS 1.2 clients that are not
running Intel LANDesk software, but instead are running other software that uses
the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\INTEL\LANDesk key, such as Norton AntiVirus 6.0.

CAUSE
=====

A previous hotfix for SMS 2.0 implements functionality to prevent remote control
files from being upgraded during a client migration if Intel LANdesk is
detected. This prevents the Intel LANDesk software from not working after SMS
2.0 is installed. Intel LANDesk is detected if the
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\INTEL\LANDesk registry key exists, even if a
different program installed the key and Intel LANDesk is not installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English post-Service Pack 3 (SP3) version of this fix should have the
following file attributes or later:
