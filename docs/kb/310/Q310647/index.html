-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
- Microsoft SQL Server 2000 (all editions) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to use the Visual Basic 6.0 T-SQL Stored Procedure debugger add-in to
debug a SQL Server stored procedure on a named instance of SQL Server 2000
fails.

Three error messages occur in the following sequence:

1. After you select a stored procedure in the add-in, type parameter values (if
  any), and click Execute, a T-SQL Debugger dialog box appears with the
  following error message:

  A memory error occurred.

  Alternately, if you then click Go or Step, the stored procedure skips any
  breakpoints, and you receive the following error message:

  The query could not be debugged due to a problem coordinating events with the
  server...

2. On the client computer, the following event is logged in the Windows
  Application Event Log with a source of VBSDIDB:

  An error occurred at ..\Sdiuitrd.cpp(287)

3. On the client computer, the following event is logged in the Windows
  Application Event Log with a source of VBSDIDB:

  The system cannot find the path specified. , Line=2031, File=..\vbsdicli.cpp

  NOTE: You may or may not receive this third error message, depending on the
  operating system.

The add-in, Visual Basic, and SQL Server do not fail (crash). There are no
messages on the server side, neither in the event log nor in the SQL logs.

CAUSE
=====

The current version of the T-SQL Debugger add-in does not support named
instances of SQL Server 2000.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, debug against the default instance of SQL Server,
which you can refer to by server name alone.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Locate or install a named instance of SQL Server 2000. Do not add or use SQL
  Server 2000 Service Pack 1 because the debugger add-in does not work with
  Service Pack 1.

2. From the SQDBG_SS folder on CD #2 of Microsoft Visual Studio or Visual Basic
  Enterprise Edition, copy SDI.dll to the Binn folder of the named instance
  (which is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Sql Server\MSSQL$NamedInstance\Binn or
  similar). Use Regsvr32.exe to register SDI.dll. Note that you cannot use the
  automated Setup program that is located in SQDBG_SS for this purpose.

3. Use the ODBC Administrator to create an ODBC data source name (DSN) that
  points to the Northwind sample database on this named instance of SQL Server
  2000. Type the server and instance name in the following format:

  ServerName\InstanceName

  The connection should test successfully.

4. Locate or install Visual Studio or Visual Basic Enterprise Edition version
  6.0 Service Pack 5. To eliminate other incompatibilities with SQL Server
  2000, Service Pack 5 is required.

5. Open Visual Basic, and load the T-SQL Debugger add-in from the Add-ins menu.

6. Return to the Add-ins menu, and open the debugger.

7. On the Settings tab, select the newly created DSN, and type the
  authentication information.

8. On the Stored Procedure tab, use the already-displayed CustOrderHist stored
  procedure, and type "ALFKI" (without the quotation marks) as the only input
  parameter value.

9. Click Execute. The debugging window appears, which is followed by the
  above-mentioned sequence of errors.
