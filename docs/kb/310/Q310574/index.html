The third-party products discussed in this article are manufactured by 
vendors independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install Microsoft MechCommander 2, the game unexpectedly
quits after CD verification.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you are using a product such as DAEMON tools to
create a Virtual CD, a Phantom CD, or a virtual small computer system interface
(SCSI) CD-ROM drive on your computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, use one or more of the following methods.

Method 1: Rename the Daemon.exe File
------------------------------------

1. Click Start, point to Search, and then click "For Files or Folders".

2. In the Named box, type "daemon.exe" (without the quotation marks), and then
  click Search Now.

3. When the search process is complete, right-click daemon.exe and then click
  Rename on the shortcut menu.

4. Type "daemon.old" (without the quotation marks), and then press ENTER.

  When you receive the confirmation message, click Yes.

5. Restart your computer.

NOTE: If this method does not resolve the issue, proceed to Method 2.

Method 2: Remove DAEMON from the Registry
-----------------------------------------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks), and then click
  OK.

3. In the Registry Editor, browse to the following key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

4. Right-click DAEMON.EXE, and then click Delete on the shortcut menu.

  When you receive the confirmation message, click Yes.
