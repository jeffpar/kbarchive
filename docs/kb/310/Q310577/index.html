-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
- Microsoft Windows Management Instrumentation, version 1.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) version 1.1 (698) under
Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, the Winmgmt service may cause an access violation
error during an SMS hardware inventory.

CAUSE
=====

On some hardware configurations, WMI enumeration of the following WMI classes
may lead to an access violation error in the Winmgmt service:

- Win32_NetworkAdapter

- Win32_NetworkadapterConfiguration

- Win32_Operatingsystem

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q288239 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It may be possible to determine if the WMI classes that are listed in the
"Cause" section of this article are the problematic classes by attempting
class-instance enumeration with the Wbemtest.exe WMI utility.

Using Wbemtest.exe
------------------

1. Connect to the root\Cimv2 namespace on the computer with the problem.

2. Click the Query button to open the WQL query window.

3. Type "Select * from Win32_NetAdapter" (without the quotation marks).

4. Click Apply.

Try each of the WMI classes that are listed in the "Cause" section of this
article in the WMI query. If the Winmgmt service causes an access violation
error during instance enumeration, upgrade WMI on the affected computer or
computers to WMI version 1.5.
