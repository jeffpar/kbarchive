-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Zone.com 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click a link on a Microsoft Zone Web page, your browser may display a
generic page titled, "The page cannot be displayed". This page, may list a
specific reason as to why, such as:

  Cannot find server or DNS Error.

  -or-

  HTTP 403 - Forbidden

  -or-

  HTTP 404 - File not found

  -or-

  HTTP 500 - Internal server error

  -or-

  HTTP 503 - Service unavailable

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if one of the following conditions is true:

- Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) functionality is not turned on.
- The Zone servers are down for maintenance or are experiencing problems.
- Pages stored in the Temporary Internet Files folder on your computer are
  outdated.
- An Internet accelerator program is installed on your computer.
- There is an error on the Domain Name Server (DNS) Server being used by your
  computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the appropriate method:

Connecting to a secure (https://) page
--------------------------------------

1. Start Internet Explorer.

2. On the Tools menu, click Internet Options.

3. On the Advanced tab, scroll down to the Security section, and then select the
  Use SSL 2.0 and Use SSL 3.0 options.

4. Click OK.

The Zone Servers Are Down or Experiencing a High Load
-----------------------------------------------------

If you are receiving an error such as 403, the Zone pages are either down for
maintenance or experiencing a high load. Try connecting to Zone.com again at a
later time.

Refresh the Current Web Page
----------------------------

Even if the time stamp for the Web version and your locally stored version are
the same, pressing CTRL+F5 will force Internet Explorer to download whatever
copy is currently available on the Internet.

Empty the Temporary Internet Files folder
-----------------------------------------

1. On the View menu (Internet Explorer 4.x) or Tools menu (Internet Explorer
  5.0), click Internet Options.

2. Under Temporary Internet Files, click Delete Files, and then click Yes or OK.

3. Click Settings.

4. Under "Check for newer versions of stored pages", click "Every time you start
  Internet Explorer".

5. Click OK twice.

6. Quit and then restart Internet Explorer.

7. Connect to the Zone.

An Internet Accelerator Program Is Installed
--------------------------------------------

If an Internet accelerator program is installed on your computer, remove any
entries for the Zone servers from your Hosts file. To do this, follow these
steps:

1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

2. In the Named box, type "hosts" (without the quotation marks).

3. In the Look In box, click My Computer, and then click Find Now.

4. In the list of found files, double-click the Hosts file.

5. In the "Choose the program you want to use" box, click Notepad.

6. Clear the "Always use this program to open this file" check box, and then
  click OK.

7. Delete any entries that contain a reference to www.zone.com, zone.msn.com, or
  fdl.msn.com. For example, an entry may look similar to:

  131.107.75.31 www.zone.com

8. On the File menu, click Exit. When you are prompted to save the changes,
  click Yes.

Verify DNS Server Settings
--------------------------

If you are receiving a DNS error, the URL of the page you are attempting to
access may not be correctly associated with its current IP address. As a result,
your browser will be unable to connect to, and display the page. Verify your DNS
Server settings with your network administrator or ISP, and make sure the DNS
servers are working properly.
