-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the
"Restoring the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a
Registry  Key" Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log on to a Windows NT domain, one of the following error messages may
be displayed:

  An error occurred while reconnecting &lt;Driveletter&gt;: to
  \\&lt;Computername&gt;\&lt;Share&gt;

-or-

  Microsoft Windows Network: The network name cannot be found.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur when both of the following conditions are true:

- The domain that you are logging on to contains the network share specified in
  the error message.

- The name of the network share to which you are attempting to log on contains
  more than 12 characters.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

1. Install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 3 on the computer. For information about
  installing Service Pack 3, see the following article in the Microsoft
  Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack

2. Create a REG_DWORD value named AllowLongShareName in the following registry
  key, and set the data value to 1:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Rdr\Parameters

NOTE: This change does not take effect until you restart your computer.

STATUS
======

problem was corrected in the latest Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 U.S. Service Pack.
