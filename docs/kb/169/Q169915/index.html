SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to publish an existing Exchange Server public folder
as a newsgroup. This allows people using Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP)
newsreaders to participate in Exchange public folder discussions.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The key to understanding how Exchange Server supports newsgroups is the
newsgroup hierarchy anchor. A newsgroup hierarchy anchor is used to designate
the top folder in a new newsgroup hierarchy. This is demonstrated in the
following example:

You have seven public folders in your public folder hierarchy. Indentations
represent the relationship between parent folders and sub-folders:

  All Public Folders
     Outlook
        Development
     Usage
        MAPI Service Providers
     Exchange
        Internet Protocols
        Connectors

You decide to publish the Outlook, Development, Usage, and MAPI Service Providers
folders as newsgroups. To do this, you must create a new newsgroup hierarchy
anchor:

1. In the Exchange Administrator program, on the Tools menu, select Newsgroup
  Hierarchies.

2. In the Newsgroup Hierarchies dialog box, select Add.

3. Select the public folder you want to designate as the new newsgroup hierarchy
  anchor. In this example, it is the Outlook folder.

4. Click OK.

5. Repeat steps 1-4 for the anchor folder Usage.

  The subfolders of Outlook and Usage are automatically published as newsgroups
  when you designate the parent folders Outlook and Usage as the anchors.
  Newsgroup readers now have access to four new newsgroups: outlook,
  outlook.development, usage, and usage.mapi-service-providers.

  Notice that the spaces in the name MAPI Service Providers were replaced with
  dashes (-). This happened because spaces are not allowed in newsgroup names.
  Most other illegal characters in newsgroup names are automatically discarded
  or changed. It is better to carefully select the folder names and avoid
  unusual characters and spaces as much as possible.

6. After you have designated your anchors, you must change permissions for the
  published folders. You can do this with either the Exchange 5.0 Administrator
  program or the Exchange/Outlook clients. New features in the Administrator
  program make it easier to grant permissions from the Administrator rather
  than from the client.

  Often, you want to just allow anonymous access to the newly published folders.
  The following example shows you how to grant anonymous access to the newly
  published folders through the Administrator program:

  1. In the Exchange Administrator program, select Public Folders.

  2. Select the top-level public folder.

  3. On the File menu, select Properties.

  4. On the General property page, select Client Permissions.

  5. Assign the role desired to the anonymous user. By default, the role of
     Anonymous is None.

  6. Click OK.

  7. Select the Propagate These Changes to All Sub-folders check box.

  8. Click Apply.

  9. On the Sub-folder Properties dialog box, the Client Permissions check box
     should already be selected, but be sure it is selected.

  10. Click OK until you fully exit all dialog boxes.
