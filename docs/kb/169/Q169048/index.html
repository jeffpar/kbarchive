SUMMARY
=======

If you own the full version of NBA Full Court Press, you can download the
1995-96 or 1996-97 patch to make game play more fun and realistic.

NOTE: These patches will not work for the international version of NBA Full Court
Press.

The file size of each patch is approximately 0.8 MB.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the both patches, the nets are animated on made shots, the 24-second clock
resets correctly after all defensive fouls and illegal defenses, and Lob passes
occur less frequently.

The 1995-96 patch also includes the 1995-96 NBA season player and team ratings
attribute changes.

The 1996-97 patch also includes the updated 1996-97 NBA rosters.

NOTE: This patch does not include bitmap mug shots or Kevin Calabro announcements
of player names for any of the 1997 rookies or free agents.
