-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

A mailbox on Microsoft Exchange Server may grow very large; its expansion is
limited only by available disk space. This can occur when a rule has been
created that forwards mail to an address where another agent causes mail to be
returned to the user. This cycle results in a continuous flow of mail between
the automatic agents, expanding the mailbox.

CAUSE
=====

Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 does not check mailbox limits if the mail
message is generated by a rule. This allows the automatic mail to continue
indefinitely, consuming disk resources and generating excessive mail traffic.
Mailbox size limits are checked when the mail is user- generated.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the service
pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

  S E R V P A C K

MORE INFORMATION
================


NOTE: In Exchange Server version 5.5 Service Pack 3 a rule can start regardless
of the mailbox or public folder quota limits. This was first changed to correct
the situation in which meeting requests are not delivered if the recipient
mailbox is full. For additional information about that situation, click the
article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q217139 XADM: Meeting Requests Are Not Delivered if Recipient's Mailbox Has
  Exceeded the Storage Limit and Has a Delegate Defined

However, you can create the following registry key to troubleshoot a rapidly
growing information store on an Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3 computer:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersPrivate

  Value Name: Apply Mailbox Quota to Rules
  Data Type: Reg_DWORD

If this value is not 0, messages sent by rules still have the mailbox quota
checked. If the value is not present or is 0 (the default in Service Pack 3),
messages sent by rules ignore the mailbox quota for sending messages.

IMPORTANT: If you set mailbox quotas to rules, there may be side effects. For
example, if you set a forward and delete rule, it may result in data loss, and
if you set meeting requests to go only to the delegate, neither may receive the
request if the mailbox is over the limit.
