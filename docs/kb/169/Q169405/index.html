SYMPTOMS
========

When you start the GroupWise Migration utility for migrating to Exchange Server,
the following error message may appear:

  Novell GroupWise shared code directory was not found. Please reinstall
  the GroupWise client and try the migration again.

In addition, when you start the GroupWise 16-bit client, the following error
message appears:

  The directory path for the shared code is invalid.

CAUSE
=====

The GroupWise 16-bit client cannot locate the WPC20 subdirectory in the local
computer. The WPC20 subdirectory is installed during the installation process of
the GroupWise client.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem:

- Reinstall the GroupWise 16-bit client.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A Standard installation of GroupWise 4.1 copies files to the following
locations:

  GroupWise Program:   C:\OFWIN40     (These are the core files)
  WPC Shared Files:    C:\WPC20       (This is Shared Code)

If you are unsure of how to properly configure and run the GroupWise client,
contact Novell GroupWise support for assistance.
