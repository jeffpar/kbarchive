-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server message transfer agent (MTA) may fail to deliver
messages between servers that are connected via a schedulable connector (such as
X.400 or Dynamic RAS), and in turn generate the following Event Ids in the
Application Event Log:

  MSExchangeMTA Event ID: 37
  Type: Warning
  Category: Security
  The
  /O=OrganizationName/OU=SiteName/CN=Configuration/CN=Connections/CN=Conne
  ct orName (Adjacent-MTA) entity attempted to open an association while
  suspended. [MTA XFER-IN 22 35] (14)

  MSExchangeMTA Event ID: 1293
  Type: Warning
  Category: X.400 Service
  A remotely-initiated association from
  /O=OrganizationName/OU=SiteName/CN=Configuration/CN=Connections
  /CN=ConnectorName was refused. The failure reason provider is 0 and the
  reason is 0. Control block index 1. Type 1. [PLATFORM KERNEL 26 128]
  (12)

CAUSE
=====

If the Event ID 37 is generated, it is an indication that a schedulable
connector on the Exchange Server computer that logged the event is currently
configured for a connection schedule of "Never," which indicates that the
connector will neither accept nor initiate a connection to another Exchange
Server computer. Therefore, when another MTA attempts to make a connection to
this Exchange Server computer, it is refused because the current schedule set
for this connector is configured as "Never." The Exchange Server computer
attempting to initiate the connection with the Exchange Server computer where
the connector is currently configured for a connection schedule of "Never" will
typically log one or more of the following events upon failure of the attempted
connection:

  MSExchangeMTA Event ID: 1290
  Type: Warning
  Category: X.400 Service
  A locally initiated association to
  /O=OrganizationName/OU=SiteName/CN=Configuration/CN=Connections
  /CN=ConnectorName was refused. The failure reason provider was 0 and the
  reason was 0. Control block index 202. Type 1. [PLATFORM KERNEL 20 130]
  (12)

  MSExchangeMTA Event ID: 289
  Type: Warning
  Category: X.400 Service
  A connection to
  /O=OrganizationName/OU=SiteName/CN=Configuration/CN=Connections/CN=Conne
  ctorName could not be opened. [MTA XFER-IN 17 26] (12)

  MSExchangeMTA Event ID: 1294
  Type: Warning
  Category: X.400 Service
  An association with entity
  /O=OrganizationName/OU=SiteName/CN=Configuration
  /CN=Connections/CN=ConnectorName ended abnormally. [198 1 0 1 PLATFORM
  KERNEL 20 130] (10)

WORKAROUND
==========

In order for the MTAs to communicate successfully via a configured connector,
each connector involved must be configured for a connection schedule other than
"Never". The Schedule tab on the connector's property page provides control over
when the connector is available.
