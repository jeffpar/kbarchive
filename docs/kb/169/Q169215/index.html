The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Routing and Remote Access Service Update for Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

It is possible to remotely administer a Routing and Remote Access Service router
using the graphical user interface (GUI) or command line utilities from a
Microsoft Windows NT Server or Workstation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Method 1
--------

After expanding the CAB file for Routing and Remote Access Service, you can run
Copyadmn.cmd to install Routing and Remote Access Service Administrator on any
computer running Windows NT 4.0 Workstation or Server with Service Pack 3 (or
later). This allows you to remotely administer any Routing and Remote Access
Service router where you have administrative rights.

NOTE: The Copyadmn.Cmd batch file does not copy Routmon.exe, the command- line
administrative tool. If you want to use this, you must copy the file manually.

WARNING: The administrative tools should not be installed on a system that is
running Dial-up Networking or the legacy RAS services. For additional
information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q169907 Error 127 Starting Dial Up Networking After Running Copyadmn.cmd

Method 2
--------

Both the GUI tool and the command-line tool (Routmon.exe) can be used to remotely
administer a Routing and Remote Access router provided the user has
administrative rights on the remote server.

Method 3
--------

The Windows NT Resource Kit comes with a utility that allows you to remotely run
command-line utilities called Remote Command Service (RCMD). For additional
information on this utility, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q151519 Resource Kit Utility Provides Remote Command Execution

Using RCMD you can run command-line utilities such as ROUTEMON and KERNROUT to
make changes or gather information on a remote Routing and Remote Access Service
router. This can be used to administer the router from any system not running
Windows NT 4.0 with Service Pack 3 and the new administrative tools.
