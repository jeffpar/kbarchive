The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft Exchange Server documentation states that the Eicon cards are the
only X.25 cards supported by Microsoft Exchange Server. This is not true; in
some cases X.25 cards manufactured by SAT are also supported.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The statement that only Eicon cards are supported refers only to the
installation of the X.25 protocol stack within the Microsoft Exchange Server
Administrator program. Currently only Eicon cards can be used for an X.400
connector using a native X.25 connection.

There are, however, three ways to use an SAT X.25 board with a Microsoft Exchange
Server computer.

- One way is to configure a software PAD on top of both X.25 boards. Then a RAS
  connector is configured between the two Microsoft Exchange Server computers.

- The two other configurations require the XLAN-IP product to route the IP
  protocol over the X.2 physical link. On the computer running Microsoft
  Exchange Server, either configure a site connector

- or add a TCP/IP stack and configure an X.400 connector. This solution has the
  advantage of supporting both a site connector and an X.400 connector. On the
  other hand, it produces more protocol overhead and is not suited to very slow
  X.25 connections (less than 9,600 baud).
