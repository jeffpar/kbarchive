-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you shut down a Windows 95 client computer while Exchange client is
running, the following error message may occur:

  Windows cannot restart the computer or start MS-DOS mode
  with message services running. Please close all running
  programs and click OK to continue.

The system will stop responding indefinitely unless Task Manager is used to shut
down the Exchange client.

CAUSE
=====

The client computer is running McAfee's Application Manager for Windows 3.1.
McAfee does not recommend running the Application Manager as the Windows 95
shell, as it is a Windows 3.1-based program.

For more information on this, please see the following Microsoft Knowledge Base
article:

  Q135146 McAfee Secure Station Clock Drawn Incorrectly


RESOLUTION
==========

Although this is not a supported configuration, shutting down the Exchange
client before exiting Windows 95 with McAfee's Application Manager will allow a
normal shutdown. The recommended configuration however is to run the standard
Windows 95 desktop Explorer.

McAfee's Application Manager is a product manufactured by McAfee, Inc. a company
independent of Microsoft. Contact McAfee technical support for more information.
