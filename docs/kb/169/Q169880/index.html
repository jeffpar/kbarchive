SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use group policies on a Novell NetWare network
running the Novell Directory Service (NDS) with the Microsoft Client for NetWare
Networks using the Microsoft Service for NetWare Directory Services (MSNDS).

MORE INFORMATION
================

To use group policies on a Novell NetWare network running NDS with the Microsoft
Client for NetWare Networks using MSNDS, use the following steps.

NOTE: When you are creating policies for specific NetWare groups, the group
should be named the full NDS group name (for example, group1.client.novell). If
the full name is not used, the policy may not be downloaded from the server for
the group, even though other policies are applied.

1. Enable user profiles on the Windows 95-based computer. To do so, follow these
  steps:

  a. In Control Panel, double-click Passwords.

  b. Click the User Profiles tab.

  c. Click the "Users can customize their preferences and desktop settings.
     Windows switches to your personal settings whenever you log in" option to
     select it.

2. Install group policies on the Windows 95-based computer. To do so, follow
  these steps:

  a. In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs, and then click Have
     Disk on the Windows Setup tab.

  b. Type the path to the Poledit folder in the Copy Manufacturer's Files From
     box, and then click OK. The Poledit folder is located in the
     Admin\Apptools folder on the Windows 95 CD-ROM. The path should look like
     this

  &lt;drive&gt;:\Admin\Apptools\Poledit

     where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter assigned to your CD-ROM drive.

  c. Click Group Policies in the Have Disk dialog box, and then click OK.

3. Create the policy file and place it on the server. For information about the
  creation and setup of user profiles and policies, see Chapter 15, "User
  Profiles and System Policies," in the Microsoft Windows 95 Resource Kit.

4. Double-click the Network Neighborhood icon, and then double-click Entire
  Network.

5. Use the right mouse button to click your NDS tree, and then click Properties.

6. Click Enable System Policies on the NDS Administration Settings tab, and then
  set the Volume and File Path for the .pol file you placed on the server in
  step 3.

  NOTE: You must be logged in with supervisor rights to view the Administration
  tab. Also, you need to have trustee rights to the volume and have supervisor
  privileges on the volume.

7. In Control Panel, double-click Network, and then verify that the Primary
  Network Logon setting is set to Client For NetWare Networks.

8. Click Client For NetWare Networks, and then click Properties. Verify that the
  preferred server is set to the server containing the group objects, and then
  click OK.

9. The Novell NDS must have Bindery Emulation set for every server container
  that contains the users and groups. For information about how to set Bindery
  Emulation, refer to your Novell documentation.
