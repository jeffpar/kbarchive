SYMPTOMS
========

When a dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) client is moved from a subnet
where a Domain Name Service (DNS) server is configured through DHCP, to a subnet
where no DNS server is used or available, delays may occur when names are being
resolved. This can result in slow startup of applications such as Microsoft
Outlook or Microsoft Exchange, or Web browsers.

CAUSE
=====

If a network client obtains a DHCP lease from one server and then releases that
lease, two registry values are not cleaned up:

 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TCPIP
    \Parameters\DhcpNameServer

-and-

 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\TCPIP
    \Parameters\DhcpDomain

The Microsoft DHCP client software does not properly remove these values when a
lease is released.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, perform one of the following:

- Configure the DHCP scope for the subnet that the client is moving to, to
  assign a DNS server if one is available.

  -or-

- Use Registry Editor to clear these values after the client is moved to the
  new subnet.

  If you expect to change frequently between DNS and non-DNS enabled
  environments, you can use a registry file to easily disable the DNS entries
  in the registry. To do this, perform the following steps:


WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system- wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

  1. Use a text editor (such as Notepad) to create the following file and name
     it Disabledns.reg:

     REGEDIT4

     ; Disable DNS entries in the registry.
     ; There are 2 entries for this key, NameServer and DHCPNameServer
     ; DHCPNameServer is written by the DHCP client service, if enabled.
     ; But if the NameServer parameter has a valid value, it will
     ; override the DHCPNameServer parameter.

     [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services
        \Tcpip\Parameters]
        ; "NameServer"=""
        "DhcpNameServer"=""

  2. Save Disabledns.reg to your desktop, or create a shortcut to this file on
     your desktop.

     Running this file clears the DhcpNameServer registry entry. After you are
     connected to the network, renewing the IP address from the DHCP server
     recreates the correct entries in the registry and lets you use the name
     server again.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 4.0. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
