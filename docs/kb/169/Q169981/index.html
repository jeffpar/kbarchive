-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you convert documents between Microsoft Word versions 6.x, 7.x, and
Microsoft Word 97, the contents of an Addin field may be lost or incomplete when
you open the document in Microsoft Word versions 6.x or 7.x using the Word 97
Import Converter.

NOTE: The Addin field may display as a "pimprivate" field. The WordBasic
GetFieldData$() statement will not work on this field.

This problem occurs in all of the following cases:

Case 1
------

You insert an Addin field into a Microsoft Word 6.0 or 7.0 document and then you
open that document in Microsoft Word 97.

Case 2
------

You insert an Addin field into a Microsoft Word 97 document, save the document as
Word 6.0/95 or Rich Text Format (RTF), and then you open that document in
Microsoft Word 6.0 or 7.0.

Case 3
------

You insert an Addin field into a Microsoft Word 97 document, and then you open
that document in Microsoft Word 6.0 or 7.0 with the Microsoft Word 97 import
converter (Wrd97cnv.exe).

CAUSE
=====

The conversion process changes the contents of the Addin field from ANSI to
Unicode.

-and-

Addin fields are not converted in Word versions 6.x, 7.x when opening a Word 98
document with the Word 98 import converter.

RESOLUTION
==========

Case 1
------

To correct the problem in Case 1, install Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 1
(SR-1).

For additional information about SR-1, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  

  Q172475 OFF97: How to Obtain and Install MS Office 97 SR-1

NOTE: SR-1 does not correct the problems in Case 2 or Case 3.

Cases 1, 2, and 3
-----------------

Use one of the following methods:

Method 1: Word 7.x and later - Custom Properties and the DocProperty field:

In Word versions 7.x and later, you can create custom file properties that
include any value you assign or that are linked to specific items in your file,
such as a named cell in Microsoft Excel, a selected item in Microsoft
PowerPoint, or a bookmark in Word. For example, in Excel, you can create a
custom file property to use in all budget files that is linked to the cell that
contains the budget total. Then you can search for all budget files with totals
that exceed a certain value.

To create custom file properties for the active document:

1. On the File menu, click Properties, and then click the Custom tab.

2. In the Name box, type a name for the custom property, or select a name from
  the list.

3. In the Type box, click the type of property you want.

4. In the Value box, type a value for the property.

  The value you enter must match the selection in the Type box. For example, if
  you click Number in the Type box, you must type a number in the Value box.
  Values that don't match the property type are stored as text.

5. Click Add.

After adding a custom property, to insert the custom property value into your
document, use the DocProperty field:

1. On the Insert menu, click Field.

2. In the Categories list box, select Document Information.

3. In the Field names list box, select DocProperty.

4. Click Options.

5. In the Property list box, select the name of the custom property containing
  the value you want inserted into your document.

6. Click Add to field.

7. Click OK to return to the Field dialog box.

8. Click OK to return to your document.

Method 2: Use document variables to store and retrieve values:

In Word versions 6.x and later, you can use document variables to create and
later retrieve values stored within your document.

The following Visual Basic for Applications code example adds a document variable
named "Customer Name" to the active document. The code then retrieves and
displays the value and then inserts the value stored in the document variable at
the current insertion point.

  Sub AddDocVar()
     Dim sVarName As String
     Dim sVarValue As String

     ' Enter the variable name and value.
     sVarName = "Customer Name"
     sVarValue = "John Doe"
     ' If the named document variable already exists
     ' an error will occur, in which case, the value is updated.
     On Error Resume Next
     ' Create the document variable and enter the document variable value.
     ActiveDocument.Variables.Add Name:=sVarName
     ActiveDocument.Variables(sVarName).Value = sVarValue
     ' Retrieve and display the value.
     MsgBox ActiveDocument.Variables(sVarName)
     ' Retrieve and insert the value into the active document.
     Selection.TypeText ActiveDocument.Variables(sVarName)
  End Sub

To later retrieve these document variable values in Word versions 6.x, 7.x, you
need to create a WordBasic macro. The following example shows how to retrieve as
well as set document variables using WordBasic.

NOTE: This macro does not run in Word 97 Visual Basic for Applications without
modification. For information on how to do this in Word 97, see the Visual Basic
for Applications macro example found earlier in this article.

  Sub MAIN
     ' Create the document variable and enter the document variable value.
     sVarName$ = "Customer Name"
     sVarValue$ = "John Doe"
     SetDocumentVar sVarName$, sVarValue$
     ' Retrieve and display the value.
     MsgBox GetDocumentVar$(sVarName)
     ' Retrieve and insert the value into the active document.
     Insert GetDocumentVar$(sVarName)
  End Sub
