SUMMARY
=======

Although InterNIC has required a primary and secondary name server in the past,
it did not always fully verify their functionality. InterNIC is now consistently
verifying whether the servers you have specified are lame. Lame, as defined by
InterNIC, is "the condition whereby a name-space is delegated to an entity but
that entity will not answer to that name". If the nslookup utility returns an
authoritative answer (when queried for a Status Of Authority [SOA] resource
record) for your domain name, then your servers are not considered lame.

See the following on the InterNIC server for more information:

InterNIC Lame Delegation Policy:

  ftp://rs.internic.net/policy/internic/internic-domain-5.txt

How to Test Your DNS Server
---------------------------

In this article, you will be using the NSLOOKUP command-line utility provided
with Windows NT Server. Type NSLOOKUP at an MS-DOS command prompt, then press
Enter. This will start NSLOOKUP in interactive mode (as opposed to line mode).
You will now see that the prompt is a greater than (&gt;) sign. Type a question
mark "?" without the quotes, and then press enter. This will give you the
commands available for use in NSLOOKUP. Also, to quit gracefully from the
NSLOOKUP utility, type "exit" and press enter.

There are three commands you can use to test our name servers: SERVER, SET, and
`NAME'. `NAME' is not actually a command, it is just the fully qualified domain
name as specified in the WHOIS record. The WHOIS database is maintained by
InterNIC and contains information for all domain names registered to it.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q169213 How to Verify Internet Domain Registration Info with InterNIC

A sample WHOIS record for the Test.net domain:

The whois client utility is not available with Windows NT. You can access this
information through the World Wide Web at:

  http://rs.internic.net/cgi-bin/whois

-or-

By telnet 198.41.0.5.

Below is a what you would see using telnet:

In Windows NT 4.0, click the Start button, click Run, and type "TELNET
198.41.0.5" (without the quotation marks)

You will see the following on your screen. Comments are preceded by *****

*****(Remember, these are examples, please replace all mentions of
*****ns1.test.net   with your primary DNS servers hostname and
*****harris2.diablo1.com     with your secondary DNS servers hostname.)

*****The above is an example of an "authoritative answer." The name server,
*****NS1.TEST.NET, returned the SOA (Status of Authority) record for the
*****domain TEST.NET.

*****This is what to expect from a lame server. HARRIS2.DIABLO1.COM is
*****listed as TEST.NETs secondary name server and is required to be
*****authoritative for the TEST.NET domain:

&gt;
&gt;NSLOOKUP
Default Server:  ntw.test.net

&gt;SERVER harris2.diablo1.com

&gt;SET TYPE=ANY
&gt;test.net

Address: 200.200.200.1

Non-authoritative answer:
test.net     nameserver = ns1.test.net
test.net     nameserver = harris2.diablo1.com

Authoritative answers can be found from:
test.net     nameserver = ns1.test.net
test.net     nameserver = ns2.test.netn
ns1.test.NET          internet address = 123.123.123.253
harris2.diablo1.com      internet address = 200.200.200.1

*****The above is returning a non-authoritative answer and is telling us
*****where to get an authoritative answer from. Note that it is telling us
*****that an authoritative answer can be obtained from ourselves!
