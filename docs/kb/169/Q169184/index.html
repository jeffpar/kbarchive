SYMPTOMS
========

This problem occurs when you are attempting to download an Offline Address Book
from an Exchange Client computer that is connecting to an Exchange Server
computer configured to use Multiple Address Books. If you start downloading an
Offline Address Book, cancel the operation, and then select another Offline
Address Book to download, that second Offline Address Book is not downloaded.
The Offline Address Book you selected appears to be downloading, and no error
message is generated, but it is not downloaded.

Here is how the problem occurs. You start downloading an Offline Address Book.
The "Offline Address Book Selection" dialog box offers you a choice of Offline
Address Books to download. If you move the "Offline Address Book Selection"
dialog box from the foreground, you will see the "Download Microsoft Exchange
Address Book" dialog box, which has an animation that says "connecting to
Microsoft Exchange Server." You click Cancel in this dialog box to cancel the
download. You select a second Offline Address Book in the "Offline Address Book
Selection" dialog box and click OK to begin downloading it. It appears that the
highlighted Offline Address Book is being downloaded. No error message is
generated, but the Offline Address Book is not downloaded.

NOTE: In order to click Cancel in the "Download Microsoft Exchange Address Book"
dialog box (it is hidden behind the "Offline Address Book Selection" dialog box
initially), you must move the "Offline Address Book Selection" dialog box.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server 5.0.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
