-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Server versions 2.0, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to setup a remote debug for troubleshooting problems
with your Internet Information Server (IIS). These steps should be followed
after you consult a Microsoft Support Professional and you agree that a debug is
necessary.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Process 1 - To install the symbol files
---------------------------------------

This process should be used to enhance the output log of a Dr. Watson file. It
should also be used in conjunction with Process 2 for a remote debug.

1. Make sure you are running the latest Service Pack (SP) update to Microsoft
  Windows NT Server.

2. Obtain the latest Service Pack symbols file from the Service Pack compact
  disc.

3. If you install from the downloaded symbols file, type in the following
  command to install them:

      Filename -d Install Path


  where Filename is the downloaded file, and Install Path is the path to your
  Windows NT Server directory with \Symbols appended. For example, Sym_400I.exe
  -d C:\Winnt\Symbols.

4. If you install from the SP compact disc, copy all subdirectories from the
  Support\Debug\Symbols directory to the Winnt\Symbols directory.

Process 2 - To set up for a debug
---------------------------------

1. Create a directory called Debug under your Windows NT directory.

2. Unzip and copy the following files (from the Windows NT Resource Kit) to the
  debug directory you created:

      Tlist.exe (in the \Compdiag directory)
      Remote.exe (in the \Netadmin directory)


  If you do not have the resource kit, you can obtain these files from your
  Microsoft Support Professional.

3. Copy the .Exe and .Dll files located on the Windows NT compact disc
  (\Support\Debug\) to the Debug directory.

4. Start a command window and change into your debug directory.

5. Use Tlist.exe file to list the processes. Make a note of the ID for the
  Inetinfo.exe process. It is the number to the left of the process.

6. Type in the following command (leaving quotes in place):

      Remote /s "cdb -p " debug


7. At the debug prompt, type the following:

      .logopen c:\debug.txt


8. Press g and ENTER to restart the inet service.

9. Minimize the command window and wait for the server to stop. Contact your
  Support Professional, and then start the remote session.

Process 3 - To set up RAS
-------------------------

1. Make sure you have RAS service installed on a Windows NT Server on the
  network.

2. Make sure that the RAS is set up to receive incoming calls.

3. Create a user account that is a member of the administrators group. Ensure
  that the user has dial-in privileges.

Process 4 - To create a debug file
----------------------------------

These steps can be used in case you get a crash, and you need to restart the
computer before a Debug engineer can get back in touch with you.

1. In the debug window, type the following:

     kv

2. Type the following:

     .logclose

3. Type q

4. You can now restart the server and mail the log file to the Support Engineer
  you are working with.
