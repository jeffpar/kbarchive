-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you send an Outlook message with a category selected to a Microsoft Mail 3.5
recipient, the message will be rejected immediately by the Microsoft Mail
Connector interchange (MSMI). You receive a non-delivery report (NDR) with the
error message:

  MS Mail Connector failed parsing the message content.

CAUSE
=====

Outlook send-forms with a category selected contain named properties. These
named properties have not been recognized properly by the MSMI. As a result the
MSMI generated NDRs.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem:

- Do not use categories when sending messages to Microsoft Mail users.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 4.0. This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for
Microsoft Exchange Server version 4.0. For information on obtaining the Service
Pack, query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
