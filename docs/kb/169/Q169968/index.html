The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, you should first make a backup copy of the
registry files (System.dat and User.dat). Both are hidden files in the
Windows folder.

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Word 97 does not have a built-in method of copying a custom label
definition from one computer to another, but this may be accomplished by copying
the registry key for the definition to another computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows 95. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the Changing Keys And Values
online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). Note that you should make a
backup copy of the registry files (System.dat and User.dat) before you edit the
registry.

To share your custom label settings, follow these steps.

Export Your Custom Label Settings
---------------------------------

This procedure exports a registry setting so that you can add it to the registry
of another computer.

1. Click the Start button, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "regedit" (without the quotation marks) and then click
  OK to start the Windows registry editor.

3. Browse to the following registry setting:

    HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word\Custom Labels

4. In the window on the left, click to select the Custom Labels key.

5. On the Registry menu, click Export Registry File.

6. In the Export Registry File dialog box, enter the file name and location in
  which to save the registry key and click Save.

  NOTE: The registry key is saved in a *.reg file with the name and location you
  specified.

7. Copy the registry file you created in step 6 to a floppy disk or to a network
  location.

Import Your Custom Label Settings to Another Computer
-----------------------------------------------------

This procedure imports the registry key you exported earlier into the registry of
a different computer.

On the computer to which you want to import the custom label settings, use
Windows Explorer to locate the *.reg file you created in step 6 earlier, and
then double-click the *.reg file. The following message is displayed:

  Information in &lt;path\filename.reg&gt; has been successfully entered into
  the registry.

The custom label settings are now stored in the registry of the other computer,
making the custom label settings available in Microsoft Word.
