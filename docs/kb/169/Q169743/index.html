-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Microsoft Exchange Client for Windows 3.x, you may not
automatically receive new mail when it is delivered. You must perform another
function, such as selecting another folder and then clicking the Inbox again,
before the new mail appears.

CAUSE
=====

Notification of new mail is a task initiated from the server. The server
notifies the client that new mail has arrived so the client can update its Inbox
display. However, in order for the server to notify the client of an update, the
server must send directly to the client's IP address.

RESOLUTION
==========

Verify that the correct IP address entries for the client computer are on the
Domain Name Services (DNS) server, WINS server, or in the HOSTS file on the
Exchange Server computer. You can also try to resolve the problem by adding the
computer name and IP address of the client machine to its own HOSTS file.

For more information on how to troubleshoot Microsoft Exchange for Windows 3.x
client using TCP/IP, see Q155048, "Troubleshooting Startup of Windows Client
Using TCP/IP" in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.
