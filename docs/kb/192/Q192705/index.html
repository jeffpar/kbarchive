The information in this article applies to:

- The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 5.0 
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Professional Edition, version 5.0 
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, version 6.0

SYMPTOMS
========

The following two problems occur when embedding an ActiveX control in an MDI
application written in Visual Basic:

- Clicking the ActiveX control that is embedded in the MDI child form does not
  activate the MDI child window; however, clicking other areas works correctly.

- In Visual Basic 5.0, when focus is in the ActiveX control, pressing CTRL+TAB
  doesn't activate the next MDI child window in the MDI application.

  NOTE: This problem has been corrected in Visual Basic 6.0.

CAUSE
=====

These problems are caused by the controls having the WS_EX_NOPARENTNOTIFY style.
Windows's MDI child activation is based on the MDI client window getting the
WM_PARENTNOTIFY message. However, this message is suppressed when the
WS_EX_NOPARENTNOTIFY style is specified. Visual Basic does not address this
scenario, which causes the problems to occur.

RESOLUTION
==========

Correcting these problems from the control site can be done in the following
ways:

- Remove the WS_EX_NOPARENTNOTIFY extended style from the ActiveX control's
  window. This can be done by overriding PreCreateWindow() and unsetting the
  style bit.

- For Visual Basic 5.0 clients, send a WM_MDINEXT message to the parent window
  of the MDI child window (for example, the MDI client window) so the next MDI
  child window can be activated.

STATUS
======

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

PreCreateWindow() is a CWnd virtual function that accesses the CREATESTRUCT
structure for the window just prior to its creation. The WS_EX_NOPARENTNOTIFY
window style is an extended style, and can be unset in the following manner:

     BOOL CFocusCtrl::PreCreateWindow(CREATESTRUCT&amp; cs)
     {
        cs.dwExStyle &amp;= ~WS_EX_NOPARENTNOTIFY;
        return COleControl::PreCreateWindow(cs);
     }

If Visual Basic 6.0 is used to create the MDI application, no further action
should be necessary. For Visual Basic 5.0 clients, you must provide custom
handling for the CTRL+TAB keystroke.

OnKeyDown is a CWnd member function that has been overridden for this control
class. The code traps the CTRL+TAB keystroke and sends a WM_MDINEXT message to
the parent window. The parent window itself is determined by calling a new
function, GetMDIChildHwnd().

GetMDIChildHwnd() tries to locate the window that has the style WS_EX_MDICHILD
(for example, an MDI child window of an MDI application). The window may be the
immediate parent window of the control, or the parent window of the immediate
parent of the control (for instance, an MDI child window with a frame control
that contains an embedded ActiveX control):

     HWND CFocusCtrl::GetMDIChildHwnd()
     {
        // Get the window associated with the in-place site object,
        // which is connected to this ActiveX control.
        HWND hparent;
        if (m_pInPlaceSite != NULL)
           m_pInPlaceSite-&gt;GetWindow(&amp;hparent);

        // Loop until either an MDI child window or no parent window is
        // found. MDI child window will have a WS_EX_MDICHILD window
        // style.
        CWnd* parent = FromHandle(hparent);
        do
        {
           if (parent == NULL)
              break;

           // Check to see whether or not it is an MDI child window.
           // Returns the HWND of the MDI child window to the caller.
           DWORD style = parent-&gt;GetExStyle();
           if (style &amp; WS_EX_MDICHILD)
              return parent-&gt;GetSafeHwnd();

           parent = parent-&gt;GetParent();
        }
        while (1);

        return NULL;
     }

     void CFocusCtrl::OnKeyDown(UINT nChar, UINT nRepCnt, UINT nFlags)
     {
        if ((GetKeyState(VK_CONTROL) &lt; 0) &amp;&amp; nChar == VK_TAB)
           {
              // Activate next MDI child window in the MDI application by
              // sending a message to the client window (the parent
              // of the MDI child window).
              CWnd* mdichild = CWnd::FromHandle(GetMDIChildHwnd());
              if (mdichild)
                 (mdichild-&gt;GetParent())-&gt;SendMessage(WM_MDINEXT);
           }

        COleControl::OnKeyDown(nChar, nRepCnt, nFlags);
     }

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create an MDI application in Visual Basic.

2. Add an ActiveX control and a textbox control to the MDI child form in design
  mode.

3. Run the MDI application. The MDI application will show an MDI child window
  during startup.

4. On the File menu, click New to create another MDI child window. Tile both MDI
  child windows. You will notice that one MDI child window is active and the
  other is inactive.

5. Click the ActiveX control of the inactive MDI child window; the MDI child
  window is not activated. Click another area other than the ActiveX control in
  the inactive MDI child window; the MDI child window changes from an inactive
  to an active state.

In Visual Basic 5.0, when focus is in the textbox control, pressing CTRL+TAB
activates the inactive MDI child window. However, pressing CTRL+TAB has no
effect if focus is in the ActiveX control.
