SUMMARY
=======

The following error occurs when using RDO or ADO to update data in an Access
(Jet) database:

  Query is too complex

Due to a limitation of the Jet database engine, this error can occur if the
recordset to be updated contains more than 40 fields.

Using the Jet 3.51 engine, the error occurs if the recordset to be updated
contains more than 50 fields. With the Jet 4.0 engine and later, the error
occurs if the recordset to be updated contains more than 99 fields.

Using the Jet 4.0 engine and later, you may also see the errors:

  Expression too complex

-or-

  Too many defined fields

This article describes the problem scenario, the Jet limitation, and several
workarounds.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When executing the Update() or BatchUpdate() methods of RDO's rdoResultset
object, or the Update() or UpdateBatch() methods of ADO's Recordset object, the
ODBC error S1000 "Query is too complex" (Visual Basic run-time error 40002)
occurs. An error with the same description occurs using the Microsoft Jet OLE DB
providers versions 3.51 and later.

This behavior occurs because the default behavior of ADO and RDO is to use each
field in the recordset to determine the record to be updated on the server. That
is, when the update is attempted, a SQL Update query is sent to the server. Part
of this query is a WHERE clause that is used to identify the record to be
updated. An AND clause appears within the WHERE clause for each field to be used
in that identification. Updating a recordset with more than 40 fields involves a
WHERE clause with more than 40 ANDs.

The Jet engine allows only 40 AND clauses within a SQL WHERE or HAVING clause.
Jet 3.51 increased this limit to 50 AND clauses, and Jet 4.0 increased the limit
to 99 AND clauses. The Access engine returns a "Query is too complex" error when
it encounters such a SQL statement. See the REFERENCES section of this article
for more information.

There are several ways to avoid this behavior:

1. For new applications, use DAO when working with Access databases. DAO was
  designed for this purpose, and will not issue a SQL query to perform the
  update. Note that RDO and especially ADO were designed to operate efficiently
  with many other types of databases and are recommended for applications that
  will interact with various servers or that will be upsized in the future to
  use Microsoft SQL Server, for example.

2. When opening the recordset to be updated (such as the RDO OpenResultset or
  ADO OpenRecordset methods), select specific, and 40 or fewer fields.

3. Use a server-side cursor:

   - To do this in ADO, set the CursorLocation location property of the
     Recordset object to adUseServer before opening the Recordset:

           ...
           Dim rs As ADODB.Recordset
           Set rs = New ADODB.Recordset
           rs.CursorLocation = adUseServer
           rs.Open ...
              ...

   - In RDO, set the CursorDriver property of the rdoEnvironment object before
     calling the OpenConnection() method:

           ...
           Dim eng As RDO.rdoEngine
           Dim cn As RDO.rdoConnection
           Dim env As RDO.rdoEnvironment
           Dim rs As RDO.rdoResultset

           Set eng = New rdoEngine
           Set env = eng.rdoCreateEnvironment(...)
           env.CursorDriver = rdUseServer
           Set cn = env.OpenConnection(...)
           Set rs = cn.OpenResultset(...)
           ...
   

4. Ensure that a unique key is used to identify the record to be updated, rather
  than the default behavior of using every field. A unique key (though not
  necessarily a primary key) must be defined in the underlying recordset for
  this technique to work.
   - To do this in ADO (this will not work in versions prior to ADO 2.0), set
     the Recordset object's "Update Criteria" property to adCriteriaKey. This
     will work both for the Update() and UpdateBatch() methods:

           ...
           Dim rs As ADODB.Recordset
           Set rs = New ADODB.Recordset
           rs.CursorLocation = adUseClient
           rs.Properties("Update Criteria").Value = adCriteriaKey
           rs.Open ...
           ...
      

   - For RDO, use the ClientBatch cursor library and ensure that the Resultset
     object's UpdateCriteria property is not set to rdCriteriaAllCols. By
     default, this property is set to rdCriteriaKey, which will cause the use
     of the primary key to determine the row(s) to be updated on the server:

           ...
           Dim eng As RDO.rdoEngine
           Dim cn As RDO.rdoConnection
           Dim env As RDO.rdoEnvironment
           Dim rs As RDO.rdoResultset

           Set eng = New rdoEngine
           Set env = eng.rdoCreateEnvironment(...)
           env.CursorDriver = rdUseClientBatch
           Set cn = env.OpenConnection(...)
           Set rs = cn.OpenResultset(...)
           rs.Edit
           ...
           rs.UpdateCriteria = rdCriteriaKey
           rs.Update
           ...
