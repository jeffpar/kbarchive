The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic 6 Deluxe Learning Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Learn Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Now CD-ROM includes sample files for the
book "Microsoft Visual Basic 6 Step by Step." However, you may not be able to
access these files directly from the CD-ROM.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. The Visual Basic 6 Step by Step files are located in
a self-extracting file on the Learn Visual Basic Now CD-ROM. You must run the
self-extracting file to install the practice files to your hard drive before you
can use them.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following steps are adapted from the "Installing and Using the Practice
Files" section of "Microsoft Visual Basic 6 Step by Step," beginning on page
xv:

1. Remove the Learn Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Now CD-ROM from the Microsoft
  Visual Basic 6.0 Learning Edition jewel case. Note that the Visual Basic 6.0
  Learning Edition jewel case contains two CD-ROMs. To find the Learn Microsoft
  Visual Basic 6.0 Now CD-ROM, gently lift the black CD- holder away from the
  jewel case. The Learn Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Now CD-ROM is on the back of
  the black CD holder.

2. Insert the CD-ROM in your CD-ROM drive.

  On many systems, Windows will automatically recognize that you have inserted a
  CD, and start running one of the programs on the CD. If this happens, click
  Cancel, confirm that you want to cancel the installation, and click Finish.

3. On the taskbar at the bottom of your screen, click the Start button, and then
  click Run.

4. If you have the Deluxe Learning Edition, type d:\vb6sbs\vb6sbs.exe in the
  Open box.

  -or-

  If you have the standard Learning Edition, type d:\inaction\vb6sbs.exe in the
  Open box.

  Don't add spaces as you type. (If your CD-ROM drive is associated with a
  different drive letter, such as e, type it instead of d.)

5. Click OK. This will open a self-extracting ZIP file.

6. Click Unzip to accept the preselected settings to copy the Microsoft Visual
  Basic 6.0 Step by Step accompanying files to the proper location on your hard
  drive.

7. When the files have been installed, click OK, and then click Close. Remove
  the CD-ROM from your CD-ROM drive and replace it in its jewel case.

  A folder called \Vb6sbs has been created on your hard disk, and the practice
  files have been placed in that folder.
