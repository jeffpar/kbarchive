-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If you send a message containing an embedded object, for example, a bitmap
image, you may receive the following non-delivery report (NDR):

  Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

     Subject: embedded object 2
     Sent: 04/02/98 13:07

  The following recipient(s) could not be reached:

     &lt;recipient name&gt; (X400) on 04/02/98 13:06
        The message contains a content type that is not supported
        MSEXCH:MSExchangeMTA:SITEA:EXCHSRV

Additionally, a content conversion error (Event ID 210) is logged on the
destination server.

This issue only occurs in the following circumstances:

- You are sending from an Exchange Server 5.5 server to an Exchange Server 4.0
  server.

- The two servers are connected via an X.400 Connector.

- The sites do not have directory replication configured between them.

- The embedded object has been placed in the message by clicking the Insert
  menu and clicking Object in the Outlook or Exchange client.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange 4.0 message transfer agent (MTA) was not handling OLE objects
correctly and therefore could not convert this message.
