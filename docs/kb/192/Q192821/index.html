SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to restore the registry from a backup device (such as a tape
drive), the restore operation fails and the system displays the following STOP
error message:

  STOP 0x0000009A
  SYSTEM_LICENSE_VIOLATION

This error appears even though Windows NT has been configured the same as the
previous installation that you are trying to restore (domain controller type,
same directory, and so on).

CAUSE
=====

The error message is not typical of those normally associated with this STOP
code. Verify whether the original registry (which is being restored) has been
modified by the installation of McAfee Netshield virus protection software.
Netshield places an extra value named ProductSuite in the following registry
key:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ProductOptions\ProductType\ 

If this value exists in the registry, the computer will generate a STOP error
when you attempt to overwrite the registry key.

RESOLUTION
==========

If the registry has been modified as noted above, there are two options to work
around this problem:

- Restore the registry to another installation of Windows NT in a different
  directory.

- Install McAfee Netshield so that the new registry key matches the previous
  registry on the backup. This prevents the computer from detecting a
  difference between the two when a full restore is attempted.
