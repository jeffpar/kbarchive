SYMPTOMS
========

A Visual Basic project group contains at least eight ActiveX DLL projects and
one standard EXE project. The Standard EXE project creates and releases the
ActiveX DLL files. The project group is compiled into DLL and EXE files. The EXE
file is run.

The first time you create and release the ActiveX DLL files, the program runs
successfully. However, the second time you create and release the ActiveX DLL
files, an application error occurs and displays the following message:

  The instruction at "0x6602c2c5 referenced memory at "0x010b008c". The Memory
  could not be "written".

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information
about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q194022 INFO: Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs, What, Where, Why

  Q194295 HOWTO: Tell That Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs Are Installed

MORE INFORMATION
================

The bug occurs only when the compiled projects are run outside the Visual Basic
IDE. The bug does not occur when you run the project through the Visual Basic
IDE.

This section shows you how to create a sample project that demonstrates the bug
behavior. The section assumes you are familiar with creating ActiveX DLL
projects, standard EXE projects, project groups, and compiling these files into
a executable file.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

The sample project contains eight ActiveX DLL projects that will be used in a
Standard EXE project. The Standard EXE project is then compiled into an
executable file. The executable file is then run to demonstrate the bug
behavior.

To create the eight ActiveX DLL projects:

1. Start a new ActiveX DLL project in Visual Basic. Class1 is created by
  default.

2. Copy the following code to the Code window of the Class1:

  Option Explicit
        Public Sub DoNothing()

        End Sub

3. Save this Class module as Class1.cls and this project as Project1.vbp.

4. Add another ActiveX DLL project to the project group. Class1 is created by
  default. Remove the Class1 class module from this project and add the Class1
  class module you created for Project1.vbp to the new ActiveX DLL project.

5. Save this project as Project2.vbp.

6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 to add six other ActiveX DLL projects with the same
  Class1 class module to the project group. Save these projects as Project3.vbp
  through Project8.vbp.

  You have just created a project group with eight ActiveX DLL projects saved as
  Project1.vbp to Project8.vbp. Each ActiveX DLL project references the same
  Class1 class module created in Project1.vbp.

  The next step is to create a Standard EXE project that uses the eight ActiveX
  DLL projects.

To create the Standard EXE project:

1. Add a new Standard EXE project to the same project group containing the eight
  ActiveX DLL projects. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add a CommandButton to Form1.

3. Copy the following code to the Code window of the Form1 form:

        Option Explicit

        Private Sub Command1_Click()
           Dim o(8) As Object
           Dim i As Integer
           Dim strProgID As String

           For i = 1 To 8
              strProgID = "Project" &amp; i &amp; ".Class1"
              Set o(i) = CreateObject(strProgID)
              o(i).donothing
              Set o(i) = Nothing
           Next
           MsgBox "Done"
        End Sub

4. Save the project as Project9.vbp.

5. Set Project9.vbp as the Start up project. In the Project Explorer,
  right-click Project9.vbp and then click Set as Start Up. Project9.vbp appears
  in bold in the Project Explorer.

6. Press the F5 key to start to run the project in IDE. Click the Command1
  button in Form1 several times and it note that it works correctly.

7. Compile the Project Group.

8. Run Project9.exe outside the IDE. The Form1 form appears. Click Command1. A
  message box appears. Click OK to close the message box. Click Command1 again.
  Note that an application error occurs and displays the following message box:

  The instruction at "0x6602c2c5 referenced memory at "0x010b008c". The Memory
  could not be "written".
