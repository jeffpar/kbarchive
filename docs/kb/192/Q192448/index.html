SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to save or open a document on a Novell 4.11 server, the
document may fail to save or open, and you may receive an error message.

NOTE: In the following two cases, assume that you have mapped the root of drive H
to the following Novell network server folder:

  \\srctc_ss-d\sys\it\alliance\product conversion\project\teamwork\attribution

Case 1
------

When you attempt to open a document (for example, Test Methodology.doc) on a
mapped root drive, error messages similar to the following may be displayed:

  The document name or path is not valid. Try one or more of the following:

  * Check the path to make sure it was typed correctly. * On the File menu,
  click Open, search for the file using this dialog box.
  (H:\It\Alliance\Productc\Project\........\Test)

NOTE: The folder names and file names in the path may be truncated as in this
example error message. This is due to Novell OS/2 Namespace truncating the names
to eight (8) characters.

When you click OK, the following error message is displayed:

  This file could not be found. Try one or more of the following:
  * Check the spelling of the name of the document. * Try a different filename.
  (Methodology.doc)

For example, you open a document that contains spaces in the folder name or in
the file name, and the document is located in a subfolder several levels under
the map root of the drive.

NOTE: The document may open from Windows Explorer or when you browse to the root
of the NetWare volume and then browse down to the folder that contains the
document.

Case 2
------

When you attempt to save a document to a subfolder located on a map root drive,
an error message may be displayed and the document may not be saved.

For example, when you try to save a document with an 8.3 file name (such as
Test.doc) to the "Qa\Qafiles\Planning" folder, the following error message may
be displayed:

  The folder H:\Qa\Qafiles\Planning\Test.doc isn't accessible. The folder may
  be located on an unavailable volume or protected with a password.

NOTE: The "Qa\Qafiles\Planning" folder is a subfolder of the map root drive.

CAUSE
=====

These problems may occur in Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 when you are using
Novell Server 4.11 and the Novell IntraNetWare 2.2 client.

NOTE: The Novell IntraNetWare client is the replacement for Novell NetWare Client
32.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, install the Novell Netware 4.11 server patch
(Mixmod4.exe).

For more information about this patch, please refer to the Novell Technical
Support Knowledge Base article titled "Error saving files in MS Word" (Document
#2952055).

WORKAROUND
==========

To Open a Document
------------------

Use one of the following methods as appropriate for your situation to open a
document on a Novell 4.11 server:

Method 1: Map Root to Only One Long File Name Folder:

Map root only one Long File Name (LFN) connection in your login script, or use a
map root connection that contains 8-character folder and file names.

NOTE: Multiple LFN map root connections seem to cause this problem; however, map
root connections that contain a path of eight or fewer character folder and file
names do not seem to have this problem.

Method 2: Use Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks:

Uninstall Novell IntraNetWare 2.2 client and install the Microsoft Client for
NetWare Networks.

For additional information about how to install the Microsoft Client for NetWare
Networks, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q150925 How to Uninstall Novell's 32-Bit Network Client

To Save a Document
------------------

Use one of the following methods as appropriate for your situation to save a
document on a Novell 4.11 server.

Method 1: Navigate to the Subfolder:

Before you save a document with an 8.3 file name, browse to the root of the map
root drive, and then browse down through the subfolders. Then save the
document.

Method 2: Save to Local Drive:

Save your 8.3 file to your local drive, and then copy the file to the server
folder.

STATUS
======

This problem occurs when you use Microsoft Word 97 for Windows and Novell
IntraNetWare 2.2 client.
