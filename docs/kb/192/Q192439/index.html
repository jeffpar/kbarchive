-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use SMSVIEW in a command line format, the program leaves a
Create Views window open which has an OK button. You must click OK or the
program does not complete. This causes issues with automatically scheduled
SMSVIEW command line executions.

CAUSE
=====

The problem occurs because SMSVIEW does not have a Quiet Mode option.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Technical Support to obtain the
following fix, or wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack.

For a complete list of Microsoft Technical Support phone numbers and information
on support costs, please go to the following address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

This fix should have the following time stamp:

  Date     Time     Size  File Name    Platform
  ---------------------------------------------
  09/01/98 01:30PM  29K   Smsview.exe  (Intel)
  09/01/98 01:30PM  45K   Smsview.exe  (Alpha)

MORE INFORMATION
================

SMSVIEW has been upgraded in the fix to allow the use of the "/Q" switch (quiet
mode option) from the command line. The "/Q" switch must be the last parameter
in the command line. The "/Q" suppresses the Create Views window. The following
is an example of a command line:

  smsview /s:genesis1 /l:sa /d:sms /q

For information about other switches available for SMSVIEW, refer to the
"Microsoft BackOffice Resource Kit."

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next service pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.
