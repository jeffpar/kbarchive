-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When creating a query and running the Report or Label Wizard from the Output
Settings dialog box, as a result of right-clicking the query, the FoxPro menu is
nonfunctional after the wizard finishes.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do not select the "Save report and modify it in the Report Designer" option
button in the "Step 5 - Finish" page of the Report or Label Wizard.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug has been corrected in Visual FoxPro 6.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After following the steps in the Steps to Reproduce Behavior section, you
receive an error as the wizard finishes. The Designer Warning dialog box appears
with the following message:

  You cannot run or modify a report from within the Output Settings dialog.

This error is by design to warn you that the report or label can not be modified
at this time. Select OK and then close the Designer Destination dialog box.
Trying to select most of the items from the menu will be useless until one of
the wizards is opened and canceled.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a query and add any table to it.

2. Right-click the query and select Output Settings.

3. Click the report or label button and then select the wizard button located
  just below the label button.

4. Follow the steps in the wizard to create a report or label, and in the Finish
  step of the wizard, select the "Save report and modify it in the Report
  Designer" option button.

5. Select the Finish button. After giving the report or label a name, select the
  Save button.

  The following error appears:

  You cannot run or modify a report from within the Output Settings dialog.

6. Click the OK button in the Designer Warning dialog box.

7. Select the OK button in the Query Destinations dialog box and from the File
  menu, try to choose Open. The menu option appears enabled, but not
  functioning when selected. This happen to most of the other menu options as
  well.

   - To reactivate the menu open any wizard. From the Tools menu, choose
     Wizards, select any of the wizards, and then click the Cancel button.

     -or-

   - Issue the SET SYSMENU TO DEFAULT in the Command window.
