-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack (SP) 1 or a Microsoft
Exchange Server 5.0 post-SP2 hotfix to Store.exe, messages sent to users on the
same information store or to users outside the site may be returned with a
non-delivery report (NDR) that looks similar to the following:

  Your message did not reach some or all of the intended recipients.

  Subject: message subject
  Sent:    01/01/99 11:00AM

  The following recipient(s) could not be reached:
  User1 on 01/01/99 11:00AM
     No transport provider was available for delivery to this recipient.

Also, intersite directory replication may be affected. Because intersite
directory replication is message based and must pass through the Directory
Service's mailbox in the information store, the replication messages may be
returned in the same manner as described above. The Directory Service mailbox
will appear to have a backlog of mail when you view it through the Exchange
Server Administrator's Mailbox Resources tab.

CAUSE
=====

The information store was incorrectly parsing addresses in the routing table.
This incorrect parsing results in all messages being forwarded to the MTA for
delivery, and then being returned as non-deliverable. An address in the routing
table similar to the following will cause this problem:

  Type        Value
  FAX         FAX:/O=SAMPLEORG/OU=SAMPLESITE;

NOTE: This is just an example. It does not mean that only FAX type addresses are
affected; this can happen with any address type installed by a third-party
product.


RESOLUTION
==========

Exchange Server 5.0
-------------------

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem. If you are not severely affected by this
specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Microsoft
Exchange Server 5.0 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information on support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

Exchange Server 5.5
-------------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 5.0 and 5.5.
