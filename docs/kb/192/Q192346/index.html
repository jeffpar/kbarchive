- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
- Microsoft Outlook 97 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you click the Address Book icon (on the Tools menu, click Envelopes And
Labels), Word displays the contacts in your Personal Address Book (PAB) instead
of the Outlook Address Book Contacts that you specified when you set the "Show
this address list first" option.

NOTE: To locate the "Show this address list first" option, click the Start
button, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel. Double-click the Mail
(Mail and Fax) icon, and then click the Addressing tab. You may want to set this
option based on a particular profile.

CAUSE
=====

Word uses the Personal Address Book (PAB) by default if it finds it configured
in the current mail profile.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, remove the Personal Address Book from your mail
profile.

NOTE: Make sure you move your addresses to Contacts in Outlook before you remove
the Personal Address Book from your mail profile.

To remove the PAB from your mail profile, follow these steps:

1. Quit all Windows programs.

2. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

3. Double-click the Mail (Mail and Fax) icon.

4. On the Services tab, click Show Profiles.

5. On the General tab, select the profile that you want to change, and then
  click Properties.

6. On the Services tab, select the Personal Address Book, and then click Remove.
  When the following message appears, click Yes.

  Are you sure you want to remove this information service from the profile?

7. Click OK to close the profile properties dialog box.

8. Click Close to close the Mail (Mail and Fax) dialog box.

If you have only one Outlook Contact folder, Word still may be unable to see it
even after you remove the Personal Address Book from your profile. To correct
this situation, you will need to add an additional empty Outlook Contact folder
using the following steps:

1. In Microsoft Outlook, on the View menu, click Folder List. This will allow
  you to see all of your Outlook folders in a tree structure.

2. In the Folder List, select Contacts (or your main Contact folder).

3. On the File menu, point to New and then click Folder.

4. Name your new Outlook Contact folder. Ensure the Folder contains box is set
  to Contact Items and then click OK.

  NOTE: If you are prompted with the following message, click No.

  Would you like a shortcut to this folder added to your Outlook Bar?

When you restart Word, and then click the Address Book icon on the Envelopes or
the Labels tab, Word should default to the Contact list that you had specified
in the "Show this address list first" box.
