SUMMARY
=======

When you score 20,000 points in the MindMaze game in Encarta Encyclopedia, if
you click the stairs to proceed to the next level, you receive a dialog box
containing the description of the end of your journey. When you close this
dialog box, you return to the beginning of the MindMaze game.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The dialog box at the end of the game contains the following text:

  You enter a throne room filled with people. The king and queen are in their
  thrones. The other castle denizens stand in groups of three and four,
  talking, drinking and laughing. When the king notices you, he clears his
  throat, silencing the room. "Your attention, good friends! Our rescuer is
  here! Strange one from another time, we must thank you for breaking the curse
  and saving our castle. We know that you are anxious to return home, and the
  sorceress is prepared to perform the necessary magic, but we hope that you
  will honor us by first attending a banquet to be held in your honor this
  evening. Rather soon, actually: many of us are very hungry!

  You enjoy the fine banquet that follows and are prepared to be sent back home
  by the sorceress. However, on the way to her chambers, the court alchemist
  stops you in the hall. "I'm so glad I found you, he says. The king did not
  reward you sufficiently, in my opinion, and I intend to make up for his
  oversight. I have nearly perfected the formula for changing lead into gold,
  and when I am finished, I will give you bags of it to take home with you!
  Just stay around a few more days... A week at most... No more than a month,
  definitely... A year at the absolute most, and I'm certain I'll have it..."
  He wanders off, lost in thought, and you hurry to the sorceress to be sent
  home at last.
