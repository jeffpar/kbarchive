SUMMARY
=======

ADSFshar.exe is a self-extracting executable file that contains the Visual
FoxPro form files, FileShare.scx and FileShare.sct. This sample demonstrates how
to find, add, and delete server file shares using the Active Directory Services
Interface (ADSI).

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  ADSFshar.exe

Release Date: Sep-11-1998

For additional information about how to download Microsoft Support files, click

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

NOTE: In order to use the sample, the Active Directory Service Interfaces must be
installed from either the Microsoft Developer Network CD or the following Web
site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/windows/server/Technical/directory/

ADSI is a Component Object Model (COM) based interface for accessing directory
services. Each element of the network, such as users, printers and computers,
can be treated as an object.

To use the FileShare form, run the ADSFshare.exe file and extract the form files.
Run the form from within Visual FoxPro by typing the following in the Command
window:

     DO FORM fileshare

Enter a domain name and a server name upon which to look for file shares. A
domain name is not required, but omitting the domain name increases the time of
the search. Once the server is found and the list box is populated, shares may
be selected from the list. When selected, properties for the share are listed in
the text boxes on the right. Clicking the Delete button deletes the selected
share, if the user has permissions to do so.

Shares may be added by entering a path and a share name, then clicking the Add
button. The Exit button closes the form.
