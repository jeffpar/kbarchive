SUMMARY
=======

MFCAsync.exe contains a Visual C++ 5.0 project sample that shows the
communication techniques between a client (AsyncClient) and a server
(AsyncServer) application using MFC CAsyncSocket class on each sides.

Here are some highlights of this sample:

- MFCAsync.exe follows KB article Q175668, showing the use of Transmission
  Control Protocol (TCP) socket communication in a separate thread other than
  the Graphics User Interface (GUI) thread; as such, the blocking of the GUI
  message pump does not affect the delivery of socket messages. Multiple
  instances of AsyncClient can talk to the same instance of AsyncServer.

- MFCAsync.exe also complies with KB Article Q185728 in issuing of socket Send
  and Receive calls.

- MFCAsync.exe adds message boundary on top of the stream-oriented TCP. Each
  message is sent with a 4-byte-length packet header followed by the body of
  the message. Users can append more customized packet header fields to this
  length field.

servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

The flow of logic:

1. AsyncServer listens on port 9898.

2. AsyncClient spawns a thread, which connects to the AsyncServer.

3. AsyncServer accepts the connection and spawns a thread to handle the socket
  communication.

4. AsyncClient sends data packet to AsyncServer.

5. AsyncServer receives and sends the same data packet back to AsyncClient.

6. AsyncClient receives data packet, reverses the data packet and sends back to
  AsyncServer.

7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until being disconnected either by the AsyncClient or
  AsyncServer.

Steps to run the sample:

1. Run AsyncServer.exe on machine A.

2. Run AsyncClient.exe either on machine A or machine B.

3. On the AsyncClient side, enter the server machine name where AsyncServer is
  running. Click Connect. Enter text in the Send edit box. Click Send.

4. When you are done with the test, click Disconnect on the AsyncClient side.
