-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 3.0 SP4, 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, and 4.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Changing the service account for which the HSI (Host Security Integration)
services run under, causes Host Security to function incorrectly.

CAUSE
=====

When Host Security is initially installed, the service user account is given a
cryptographic key based on the user ID that was chosen during the installation
setup process. This information is then taken and put into the registry and is
referenced when the HSI services start.

If the user account has changed, it will not match the original cryptographic key
information, causing the Host Account Cache (HAC) to become corrupted and HAC
lookups to fail. Reviewing the application log in the Event Viewer will show the
following errors coming from source SNA Host Security:

  Event ID 1244
  Unable to import cryptographic key into container Supplied code
  0x8009000d

  Event ID 594
  Host Process - was unable to create connection handle to connect to PMP

  Event ID 629
  Host Process - was unable to create connection handle to connect to UDB

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the original Service Account and password that the Host Security Services
were initially installed under.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server versions 3.0, 3.0SP1,
3.0SP2, 3.0SP3, 3.0SP4, 4.0, 4.0SP1, 4.0SP2, and 4.0SP3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

HSI is comprised of three services: SNAPMP, SNADATABASE and SNAHOSTPROCESS. All
three services must run under the same service account due to the way that HSI
was implemented.
