-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If a mobile computer is disconnected from the network during the SMSRUN server
selection process, the connection timeout, in conjunction with the number of
servers in the [Servers] section, may give the appearance that the computer has
stopped responding. However, control will be returned to the user after SMSRUN16
has completed its server selection process.

New versions of SMSRUN32 and SMSRUN16 support a new Sms.ini entry,
MaxLogonServerSearch. This entry allows the user to limit the number of logon
servers the Systems Management Server client will attempt to contact.

CAUSE
=====

A dialog box was added to Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 3 that
allows the user to stop the search for a logon server which returns control of
the system to the user more quickly.

In Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 4, support was added for the
[Local] section entry DisableFailedServerDialog in Sms.ini, which allows the
user to disable the dialog box.

When DisableFailedServerDialog is set to true, the dialog box is suppressed.
However, a delay would be experienced as the SMSRUN16 or SMSRUN32 server
selection process continues. This delay may give the appearance that the
computer has stopped responding.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Systems Management
Server version 1.2.


A supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression- tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Using MaxLogonServerSearch with the DisableFailedServerDialog set to true,
allows a mobile user to start up the computer without the "Logon Server Not
Found" message and without the delay that may occur when several logon servers
are listed in the Sms.ini file. The following is an example of a [Local] section
that includes these settings:

     [Local]
     DisableFailedServerDialog=true
     MaxLogonServerSearch=1

Additional query words: prodsms sp3 sp4 sp5 hang hung
