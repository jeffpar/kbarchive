SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Exchange Client and/or Microsoft Outlook 97/98 and
connect to an Exchange Server hosted on a computer running Microsoft Small
Business Server, the client logon attempt may fail with the following error:

  Unable to display this folder, there are no additional Microsoft Exchange
  client licenses available.

In addition, the following event may appear in the Exchange Server's event log:

  Event ID: 201
  Source: LicenseService
  Type: Error
  Description: No license was available for user &lt;domain&gt;\&lt;username&gt;
  using product MSExchangeIS.

This may happen even though there are licenses available.

CAUSE
=====

During the logon process from a client to the server, there are three
connections that are made: one for the actual client (Outlook or Exchange) and
two (see NOTE below) for the MAPI spooler. The client connects first and creates
a mapped file with the name derived from the server that it is connecting to.
The information contained in this file allows multiple connections to be linked
and only count as one user. When the MAPI spooler logs on and tries to open this
mapped file created by the client connect, the open failed because the file
handle was erroneously closed.

This caused the MAPI spooler to create a new mapped file and, therefore,
incremented the user count to 2 for every client logon attempt. The MAPI spooler
then makes a second connection to the server and tries again to open the mapped
file created by the client connect. This open failed as well, leading the MAPI
spooler to create yet another mapped file and, therefore, incrementing the user
count to 3 for every client logon attempt. As a result, using a 5-user license
for Small Business Server would only allow 2 Outlook or Exchange client logon
attempts before running out of licenses.

NOTE: The MAPI spooler opening 2 connections to the server was introduced in
Exchange Server 5.5 SP1; previous to this, it only opened one. So the number of
user connections seen as a result of this problem may fluctuate between 2 or 3,
depending on client versions. The number of User Connections can be seen by
using Performance Monitor and selecting the User Count counter under the
MSExchangeIS object.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, install Microsoft Outlook 2000.





STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3.
