architectures created by identification MIF (IDMIF) files. If SQL Tracing is
enabled, the following entries are logged in the Datalodr.log file:

  SQL&gt;&gt;&gt;select SMSID0 from _Identification_SPEC1 where isnull(SMSID0,'')
  !=''
  SQL&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Invalid column name 'SMSID0'.

correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack

site's database and then perform the site attachment again.
