-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
- Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 Service Pack 1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to open messages with the Outlook Web Access (OWA) client with
Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 Service Pack 1, you may receive the
following error message:

  HTTP Error 404 File Not Found. The Web server cannot find the file or
  script you asked for. Please check the URL to ensure that the path is
  correct. Please contact the server's administrator if this problem
  persists.

CAUSE
=====

The URL path for messages is incorrect. The OWA client is looking for a message
path of:

    javascript:parent.openNewWindow("/exchange/forms/IPM.NotefrmRoot.asp?...

Instead of:

    javascript:parent.openNewWindow("/exchange/forms/IPM/Note/frmRoot.asp?..

There is a calculation and check done on the files in the Webdata directory to
determine if the object is a file or a directory. If some flags (such as Archive
or Compressed) are set on the directory, it may cause the calculation routine to
be incorrect and produce the wrong URL.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, click the following article number to view the
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Outlook Web Access

  File Name     Version
  -----------------------
  Cdohtml.dll   5.5.2404.0

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Download the compressed Setup file appropriate for the server for your hardware
platform. Select the appropriate files as indicated by the following list:

     Alpha AXP(TM)     Psp1cdoa.exe
     Intel(R)          Psp1cdoi.exe

1. Download appropriate file to a temporary location on the server's local hard
  drive.

  Example: To download the English version for the Intel platform, visit the
  following Microsoft Web site:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/exchange/exchange-public/fixes/Eng/Exchg5.5/PostSP1/CDOHTML-fix/Psp1cdoi.exe

2. Unzip the file by typing the file name of the self-extracting archive at the
  command prompt.

  Example: The version for the Intel platform will be Psp1cdoi.

3. Stop the World Wide Web Publishing Service and the Internet Information
  Server (IIS) Administrator Service (if you are using IIS 4.0).

4. Rename your existing Cdohtml.dll in your Exchsrvr\Bin folder to Cdohtml.old.

5. Copy the included Cdohtml.dll to your Exchsrvr\Bin folder.

6. Copy the included Cdohtml.dbg file to your Winnt\Symbols folder (optional).

7. Click Start, Run, and in the text box type:

  "regsvr32.exe &lt;drive&gt;:\exchsrvr\bin\cdohtml.dll" (without the quotation
  marks)

  This will register the Cdohtml.dll.

8. Click OK on the dialog box stating the Cdohtml.dll was registered
  successfully.

9. Start the World Wide Web Publishing Service and the Internet Information
  Server (IIS) Administrator Service (if you are using IIS 4.0).

10. The Exchange Server computer should be updated successfully now, and you
  should no longer get the HTTP 404 error when opening messages.


After you apply Service Pack 3 and verify that Cdohtml.dll is the proper version,
if the problem continues to occur, uninstall the OWA component, delete the
Exchange virtual folder in IIS (if it still exists), delete the Webdata folder
off of the file system, and then, re-install OWA and SP3.
