- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This article contains information about using Windows for Workgroups
with third-party products or configurations that have not been tested
and are not supported by Microsoft.

If the steps described in this article do not function properly, use
a supported configuration or contact the manufacturer of your
third-party product for more information.

SUMMARY
=======

Although Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) Pathworks has not been tested with
Windows for Workgroups and its use is not supported with Windows for Workgroups,
you can integrate the two networks following the appropriate procedure in this
article.

Please note that separate procedures are provided for Windows for Workgroups 3.11
and Windows for Workgroups 3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WINDOWS FOR WORKGROUPS 3.11 PROCEDURE
=====================================

To properly set up Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 with DEC
Pathworks, do the following:

1. Get DEC Pathworks version 4.0 or later running at the MS-DOS level.

2. Obtain the file DECNB.386 from DEC.

3. Install Windows for Workgroups 3.11

4. Select DEC Pathworks under the "Install Windows support for the
  following network only" option.

  NOTE: There are two options for DEC Pathworks: Version 4.0 and
  Version 4.1 and later. Be sure to select the correct option.

WINDOWS FOR WORKGROUPS 3.1 PROCEDURE
====================================

The procedure below describes the steps necessary to enable the
Windows for Workgroups 3.1 full redirector to connect to DEC Pathworks
running on an Ethernet network. For additional configuration options
(such as Token Ring, asynchronous DECnet, or the Windows for
Workgroups basic redirector), call DEC Technical Support at (800)
332-8000.

This procedure assumes the following conditions are true:

- DEC Pathworks is installed in the C:\DECNET directory.
- Windows for Workgroups is installed in the C:\WINDOWS directory.
- Your boot drive is drive C.

If your system configuration differs, substitute the correct paths
where necessary.

To Integrate DEC Pathworks and Windows for Workgroups 3.1
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Make backup copies of the following files:

     AUTOEXEC.BAT
     CONFIG.SYS
     STARTNET.BAT
     PROTOCOL.INI
     SYSTEM.INI

  If you encounter any problems during this procedure, you can restore
  these files and return to your original working configuration.

2. In Windows for Workgroups Control Panel, choose the Network icon.
  Choose the Networks button and remove all the networks listed in
  the Other Networks In Use box. Choose the OK button twice to close
  the Compatible Networks and Network Settings dialog boxes. When
  prompted to restart Windows, choose the Continue button. Quit
  Windows for Workgroups, but do not restart your computer.

3. Open your AUTOEXEC.BAT file in a text editor, such as MS-DOS
  Editor, and make the following changes:

  a. Insert the REM command at the beginning of the NET START command
     line. For example, change

        c:\windows\net start

     -to-

        rem c:\windows\net start

  b. If the Pathworks directory is not already included in your PATH
     statement, add it. For example, change

        path c:\windows;c:\dos;

     -to-

        path c:\windows;c:\dos;c:\decnet;

4. Open your CONFIG.SYS file in a text editor and make the following
  changes:

  a. Insert the REM command at the beginning of the PROTMAN.SYS
     DEVICE command line. For example, change

        device=c:\decnet\protman.sys /i:c:\decnet

     -to-

        rem device=c:\decnet\protman.sys /i:c:\decnet

     NOTE: The CONFIG.SYS file contains two files with similar names:
     PROTMAN.SYS and PROTMAN.DOS. PROTMAN.SYS is the protocol manager
     for Pathworks, which you just disabled. PROTMAN.DOS is the
     protocol manager for Windows for Workgroups and should not be
     altered.

  b. Add a DEVICE command line to load the Pathworks file,
     DLLNDIS.EXE, before the line that loads WORKGRP.SYS. For
     example, change

        device=c:\windows\elnkii.dos
        device=c:\windows\workgrp.sys

     -to-

        device=c:\windows\elnkii.dos
        device=c:\decnet\dllndis.exe
        device=c:\windows\workgrp.sys

     NOTE: The file ELNKII.DOS may differ depending on the type of
     network interface card (NIC) you use.

5. The following two steps require that you use a text editor that has
  a cut and paste feature, such as MS-DOS Editor.

  a. Open the C:\DECNET\PROTOCOL.INI file, and cut the [DATALINK]
     section (including its title, [DATALINK]).

  b. Open the C:\WINDOWS\PROTOCOL.INI file, position the insertion
     point at the end of the file and paste in the [DATALINK]
     section. Do not close PROTOCOL.INI or quit the text editor.

6. Make the following additional changes to your
  C:\WINDOWS\PROTOCOL.INI file:

  a. Modify the BINDINGS statement in the [DATALINK] section so that
     it is the same as the BINDINGS statement for your other
     transports. For example, change

        bindings=elnkii.dos

     -to-

        bindings=ms$elnkii

     NOTE: In most cases, NetBEUI is your Windows for Workgroups
     transport. If this is the case, simply copy the BINDINGS
     statement from the [NetBEUI] section to the [DATALINK] section,
     and insert the REM command at the beginning of the original
     BINDINGS statement in the [DATALINK] section. For a more
     complete example of this modification, see the "Sample
     PROTOCOL.INI" section below.

  b. In the [DATALINK] section, make sure that the NI_IRQ statement
     is set to the same value as the INTERRUPT statement in your
     network card section. For example, if your network card section
     appears as follows

        [ms$elnkii]
        drivername=elnkii$
        interrupt=3
        ...

     change the NI_IRQ statement to read

        [DATALINK]
        ni_irq=3

  c. In the [NETWORK.SETUP] section, copy the LANA line for NetBEUI,
     and paste it on the next line. The line you paste should look
     similar to the following:

        lana0=ms$ewtrbtp,1,ms$netbeui

     NOTE: The first parameter, MS$EWTRBTP in this example, varies
     depending on the NIC you use.

  d. In the line you pasted, increase the LANA number by one and
     replace the last parameter, MS$NETBEUI with DATALINK. The
     resulting line should look similar to the following:

        lana1=ms$ewtrbtp,1,datalink

7. Open the STARTNET.BAT file in a text editor and make the following
  changes:

  a. Find the line that contains the NETBIND command and insert the
     REM command at the beginning of the line. For example, change

        %boot%\decnet\netbind

     -to-

        rem %boot%\decnet\netbind

  b. Add the NET START command after the line loading NETBIND. For
     example, change

        rem %boot%\decnet\netbind

     -to-

        rem %boot%\decnet\netbind
        c:\windows\net start

  c. Disable the command that starts the Pathworks redirector,
     REDIR.EXE, using the REM command. For example, change

        %boot%\decnet\redir5.exe

     -to-

        rem %boot%\decnet\redir5.exe

  d. Disable the command that loads the DLLNDIS driver using the REM
     command. For example, change

        %boot%\decnet\dllndis

     -to-

        rem %boot%\decnet\dllndis

  e. Locate the command lines that load DNNETH.EXE and add the /LANA
     switch to specify which LANA the DECnet protocol is using. (This
     is the same number you changed in step 6d; it is the LANA number
     for the DATALINK protocol.) For example, change

        %boot%\decnet\dnneth.exe /rem:2
        if errorlevel 1 %boot%\decnet\dnneth.exe /rem:2

     -to-

        %boot%\decnet\dnneth.exe /rem:2 /lana:1
        if errorlevel 1 %boot%\decnet\dnneth.exe /rem:2 /lana:1

  f. Locate the following section for the Pathworks redirector:

        echo -----------------------------------------------
        echo using basic redirector
        echo -----------------------------------------------

     Insert the line, GOTO TIMEDONE, as follows:

        goto timedone
        echo -----------------------------------------------
        echo using basic redirector
        echo -----------------------------------------------

  g. If you use LAT and/or CTERM, add the appropriate line(s) after
     the :TIMEDONE label. For example, if you want to add LAT, add
     the following lines:

        :timedone
        c:\decnet\lat.exe

     Or, if you want to add CTERM, add the following lines:

        :timedone
        c:\decnet\cterm.exe

     NOTE: If you plan to use LAT, LAD, and/or CTERM, you must copy
     the LAT.EXE, LAD.EXE, and/or CTERM.EXE files from the Pathworks
     PCSAV41 file service before you reboot.

8. Open your SYSTEM.INI file in a text editor and make the following
  changes:

  a. In the [386Enh] section, find the NETWORK statement and add the
     virtual network driver DECNET.386 as follows:

        [386enh]
        network=vnetbios.386,...,decnet.386

     NOTE: The DECNET.386 file is not included with Windows for
     Workgroups. If you have Windows version 3.1, it is located on
     Disk 2. If you are upgrading over a previous Windows
     installation that was set up for Pathworks, this file should
     already be in your WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory. If this is a new
     Windows for Workgroups installation and you do not have Windows
     3.1, DECNET.386 is available from the DECPCI forum on CompuServe
     or from DEC Technical Support.

  b. Add the following statement to the [386Enh] section:

        timercriticalsection=10000

After you restart your machine, you can connect to DEC Pathworks
servers as well as other machines in your Windows for Workgroups
workgroup. If you cannot connect to your DEC Pathworks network,
contact DEC Technical Support.

NOTE: Pathworks servers do not appear in the list of shared
directories because they are not included in the Windows for
Workgroups network browsing system. To connect to a Pathworks server,
you must type the name of the server and share name.

Sample PROTOCOL.INI
