SUMMARY
=======

The dynamic data exchange (DDE) protocol includes a feature designed to allow a
DDE client application to send commands to a DDE server. The syntax of these
execute requests and the way they should be handled by servers is not well
documented and, consequently, varies slightly with different implementations.

The current DDE protocol has no provision for returning result information from
an execute request, so a client application can only tell that the request
failed, not why it failed.

This article proposes a consistent way to handle DDE execute command requests and
a mechanism that allows result information to be returned. This article covers
the following points:

- DDE execute command syntax

- Special characters in command arguments

- Unicode considerations for Microsoft Windows NT

- The returning of result information

DDEEXEC is a dynamic data exchange (DDE) server that supports an Execute command
set. The commands allow DDE client applications to draw pictures in the main
window of the server. The following sample client applications use the DDEExec
server and are included with this application:

- EXEC is a Visual Basic(TM) version 2.0 application that allows any Execute
  command to be sent to a given topic of a DDE server. This sample client
  application tests the basic command set of a DDE server and ensures that the
  server reports command errors correctly.

- BUNNY is a Visual Basic 2.0 application that uses the server to draw a
  picture of a bunny rabbit.

- WBUNNY.DOC is a Word for Windows(TM) document based on the WBUNNY.DOT
  template that uses Word's embedded Basic language to draw yet another bunny
  picture.

- XLART.XLM is a sample Microsoft Excel macro sheet that shows how you can use
  Microsoft Excel as a DDE client to draw fascinatingly complex pictures.
