SUMMARY
=======

This article explains how protocol-driver/network-adapter pairs are numbered and
how sending, receiving, and processing orders are determined using these numbers
and network operational methods. The information is categorized under subheads;
it includes examples and suggestions for enhancing performance.

MORE INFORMATION
================

LANA Numbers
------------

LANA #:

LANA numbers provide the LAN Manager redirector a way to identify a unique
combination of one protocol driver and one network adapter (NIC) MAC driver.
LANA numbers are assigned automatically, and are based on LANA bases.

LANA Base:

A LANA base is a unique number assigned to a protocol stack. It serves as the
starting LANA number for the first protocol\MAC combination, and each subsequent
protocol\MAC binding combination is numbered in sequence starting from it. LANA
bases are specified in the PROTOCOL.INI file.

         NetBEUI           TCP/IP
LANA base   (0)              (2)
          |   \             / 
          |     \         / 
          |       \     / 
          |         \ / 
          |         / \ 
          |       /     \ 
          |     /         \ 
          |   /             \ 
LANA #:    (0)(2)             (1)
         Ethernet         Token Ring

Example:

NetBEUI has a LANA base of 0. It is bound to two NICs--Ethernet and token ring.
The first protocol\MAC combination of NetBEUI\Ethernet has a LANA number of 0.
The second combination of NetBEUI\token ring is a number in sequence starting
from 0, which gives it a LANA number of 1. If NetBEUI is bound to a third NIC it
would have a LANA Number of 2, and so on. NetBEUI only responds to LANAs 0 and
1.

TCP/IP has a LANA base of 2. It is bound to one NIC, and that combination is
uniquely identified by the LANA number of 2. TCP/IP responds only to LANA 2.

Note: In LAN Manager, TCP/IP can be bound only to one NIC at a time.


Sending Order
-------------

Once again, this information only applies to MS-DOS LAN Manager workstations with
multiple protocols. During discovery (the NCB_Call for NET USE command), the
redirector specifies the LANA number to try in the NCB [NetBIOS Control Block].
The NCB is a command destined for the protocol driver. The sequence in which the
redirector specifies the LANA numbers is determined by one of two methods.

Method 1--WRKNETS:

This parameter is found in the LANMAN.INI [WORKSTATION] section. It allows you to
specify to the redirector the order in which LANA numbers are to be attempted
when sending frames. Sending order is most important when doing discovery (the
NCB_Call) for a new resource NetBIOS name\physical network address. After a
resource is found and a session is established, future frames are sent directly
to this LANA number. Values for WRKNETS are the actual LANA numbers.

Example:

WRKNETS=2,0,1

Following the previous example, a frame is sent out in this order: on
TCP/IP\Ethernet (LANA 2); NetBEUI\Ethernet (LANA 0); and NetBEUI\token ring
(LANA 1). When a proper response (Name_Recognized) is received over one of the
LANAs, the remaining LANAs are not attempted.

Method 2--No WRKNETS:

If WRKNETS is not specified, the redirecter fills in the LANA field in the NCB
with the actual LANA numbers--lowest to highest.

The INT 5c Factor - Load Order
------------------------------

When protocol drivers are loaded, they hook Int 5c. If more drivers are loaded,
they will be chained on this interrupt. After the redirector builds the NCB and
specifies the first LANA number (see example above) to send the frame on, it
calls Int 5C with a pointer to the NCB. The last driver loaded will take a look
at the LANA number. If it does not own that number, it will pass it down the
chain to the next previously loaded protocol, which checks the LANA number and
so on until a match is found. The protocol that owns the LANA then process the
NCB and submits the frame on the wire.

                          Redirector &lt;&lt;-------- LANMAN.INI WRKNETS = 1,0,2
                          |      |
           ---------------|      |
           |                     |
           V                     V
         INT 5c                 NCB - [... SMB, LANA#, ...]
         ------
[reverse]  TCP/IP (LANA# 2)
[load   ]  NetBEUI(LANA# 1,0)
[order  ]

In this example:

- NetBEUI is loaded first by the LOAD NETBEUI command in AUTOEXEC.BAT.

- TCP/IP is loaded via the LOAD TCPIP command in AUTOEXEC.BAT.

- Note: Chain is FILO--first in last out--so TCP is first in chain.

- Redirector builds NCB with SMB, NCB command, etc. and LANA number.

- LANA number order is supplied from WRKNETS so the first number is 1.

- Redir calls Int 5c with a pointer to the NCB structure.

- TCP/IP driver is the last driver loaded, so it gets first chance to look at
  the LANA number.

- TCP knows that its LANA is 2. LANA Base &lt;= LANA # &lt;= (LANA base +
  number of TCP bindings).

- NCB LANA is 1, so the TCP driver passes control to the next protocol in the
  chain, which is NetBEUI.

- NetBEUI recognizes that LANA 1 is one of his LANAs, so it processes the NCB
  and submits the frame on the wire.

Tuning:

For the best performance:

- Place the LANA of your most used protocol first in the WRKNETS parameter.
  This factor is the most important one.

- Load your most used protocol driver last so that it will be first to look at
  the LANA number in the INT 5c chain.

Receiving Order - One MAC Driver:
---------------------------------

For this example, assume one MAC driver (one NIC). Incoming frames are passed to
each protocol driver until recognized. If a TCP frame arrives, it may be first
passed to NetBEUI, which does not recognize the frame and rejects it. The frame
may then be passed to the TCP/IP stack that recognizes it, and there be
processed. There are two ways to determine which protocol receives an incoming
frame in a particular order.

User Defined - PRIORITY:

The PRIORITY parameter in the PROTOCOL.INI (PROTMAN) section can be used to
hardcode the receive order. For example:

     PRIORITY = NETBEUI, XNS, TCPIP

Incoming frames are passed to NetBEUI first, XNS second, and TCP/IP last.

Programmed Default:

If no PRIORITY is specified, the default mechanism takes effect. This algorithm
attempts to give a frame to the protocol stack most likely to assign ownership
quickly. The order is:

1. Non LLC frames--looks at DIX type.

  TCP/IP (optional frame type)

2. LLC frames with specific LSAPs--DSAP field contains protocol type.

  NetBEUI, DLC

3. LLC frames with non-specific LSAPs--DSAP contains "AA." Type will follow
  later in frame.

  NBP

Each frame type must look further into the frame to determine protocol type, so
the protocol that has to look the least distance into the frame is the fastest.

The vector module component manages passing the frame to multiple protocol
stacks. The vector module is loaded by PROTMAN.

Receiving Order - Multi MAC Drivers:
------------------------------------

In a multi protocol/multi MAC driver configuration, a vector module is loaded for
each MAC driver (NIC). The receiving mechanism can now be derived from the
previous discussion.


Other Notes:
------------

- LAN Manager supports up to a theoretical maximum of 12 networks (LANAs).

- NetBEUI can be bound to a theoretical maximum of eight MAC drivers.

- TCP/IP can be bound to only one MAC driver.
