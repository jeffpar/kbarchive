SUMMARY
=======

If Windows fails to run in 386 enhanced mode after you run MemMaker:

- You may be having problems with a poorly behaved terminate-and-stay- resident
  (TSR) program.

- MemMaker may be using a setting that is too aggressive.

- Your computer has only 2 megabytes (MB) of memory.

- Your computer may be infected with the Stealth-C virus.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If your computer has just 2 MB of memory, you have more conventional memory
after running MemMaker but less extended memory. When you start Windows in 386
enhanced mode (after optimizing your memory use), Windows may choose to run in
standard mode since there is no longer 1 free MB of extended memory. (Windows
requires 1024 kilobytes [K] of free extended memory to run in 386 enhanced
mode.) To undo the changes MemMaker made, type "memmaker /undo" (without the
quotation marks) at the MS-DOS command prompt.

If your computer has more than 2 MB of memory, use the following steps to
troubleshoot this problem:

1. Use the interactive startup option (press the F8 function key when the
  message "Starting MS-DOS..." appears on your screen).

2. As you process your CONFIG.SYS file, select Yes to load HIMEM.SYS and then No
  to not load EMM386.EXE.

3. After responding No to EMM386.EXE, press the ESC key to load all the
  remaining device drivers.

4. Start Windows and confirm that it starts properly. If it does not, the
  problem is unrelated to MemMaker.

5. Quit Windows and run MemMaker.

6. Choose to run in Custom Setup. When you are asked if MemMaker should "Scan
  the upper memory area aggressively?", choose No.

7. Press ENTER to accept the defaults to all other options.

8. After MemMaker completes its optimization, run Windows and confirm that it
  works correctly.

9. If you are still having problems with Windows, use MS-DOS Editor to add the
  X=A000-EFFF parameter to the DEVICE= command for EMM386.EXE in the CONFIG.SYS
  file and then restart your computer.

  If the problem goes away, narrow down the exclude (X=) range.


- If you suspect your computer has the Stealth-C virus, run a virus protection
  program that can detect and remove it. To run Windows in 386 enhance mode,
  remove the UMB parameter in the CONFIG.SYS file.
