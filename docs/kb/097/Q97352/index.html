SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses basic palette awareness, such as what it takes for an
application to use palettes correctly in the Microsoft Windows graphical
environment, by covering these areas:

- Responding to palette-related messages

- Managing palette-based bitmaps

- Managing multiple palettes in one application

- Using the Clipboard with palettes

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Software
Library:

  ~ PALAWARE.EXE
  (http://support.microsoft.com/download/support/mslfiles/PALAWARE.EXE)

The reader should be familiar with basic palette use for painting operations.
This article is not about the Palette Manager, and the level of detail is
limited to the very basics of the palette managing process. A sample
application, MULTIPAL, is included on the Microsoft Developer Network CD to
illustrate the use of multiple palettes in a single application.

MULTIPAL is also included with the PALAWARE technical article located in the
Microsoft Software Library.

MULTIPAL is a Multiple Document Interface (MDI) extension to the DIBIT sample
program that accompanies the "Using DIBs with Palettes" technical article.
MULTIPAL allows you to display multiple DIBs with multiple palettes and handles
palette messaging from both the system perspective and the application
perspective. The MDI skeleton is taken from the BLANDMDI program that is
included in the Microsoft(R) Windows(TM) version 3.1 Software Development Kit
(SDK). MULTIPAL achieves device independence by using palettes at all times,
regardless of the type of device being used.

To see the application in action, open several color-intensive 8-bit
device-independent bitmaps (DIBs) at the same time and change the active DIB
window. To see the application's interaction with the rest of the system, run
another application that uses palettes (another instance of MULTIPAL will do).
