-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 6.0, 6.2, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

This information applies to both Microsoft DoubleSpace and Microsoft DriveSpace.
For MS-DOS 6.22, use DRVSPACE in place of DBLSPACE for commands and filenames.

The AutoSketch 3.0 installation program provides incorrect default settings if
you install AutoSketch on a DoubleSpace-compressed drive. Even if you correct
the settings, the installation may fail. You may receive an error message
indicating that a math coprocessor could not be found.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, disable the mounting of the compressed volume file
(CVF), install AutoSketch on the host drive, remount the CVF, and then copy the
program to the compressed drive. Detailed steps for this procedure are listed
below for both MS-DOS 6.0 and MS-DOS 6.2.

NOTE: These procedures assume drive H is your host drive; if it is not, replace H
with the actual host drive letter.

MS-DOS 6.0
----------

1. Make sure there is enough space on the host drive to install AutoSketch. If
  not, use DoubleSpace to increase the size of your host drive. (For more
  information, refer to the "Using DoubleSpace to Manage Compressed Drives"
  section of Chapter 5 in the Microsoft MS-DOS 6 "User's Guide." This section
  includes information on the Change Size command.)

2. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following commands, pressing ENTER
  after each line:

  " copy c:\command.com h:\
  copy c:\dos\attrib.exe h:\
  attrib -s -h -r h:\dblspace.bin
  ren h:\dblspace.bin temp.bin " (without the quotation marks)

3. Reboot the computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

4. Install AutoSketch on drive C (the uncompressed host drive, which was
  previously drive H).

5. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following commands, pressing ENTER
  after each line:

  " ren h:\temp.bin dblspace.bin
  attrib +s +h +r h:\dblspace.bin " (without the quotation marks)

6. Reboot the computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

7. Type the following command and press ENTER:

  " xcopy h:\sketch3\*.* c:\sketch3 /s " (without the quotation marks)

  (When prompted, indicate that this is a directory.)

8. Type the following command and press ENTER:

  " copy h:\sketch3.bat c:\ " (without the quotation marks)

9. Run the AutoSketch program to see if the installation on drive C was
  successful.

10. Quit AutoSketch.

11. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following commands, pressing ENTER
  after each line:

  " deltree h:\sketch3
  del h:\sketch3.bat " (without the quotation marks)

MS-DOS 6.2
----------

1. Make sure there is enough space on the host drive to install AutoSketch. If
  not, use DoubleSpace to increase the size of your host drive. (For more
  information, refer to the "Using DoubleSpace to Manage Compressed Drives"
  section of Chapter 5 in the Microsoft MS-DOS 6 "User's Guide." This section
  includes information about the Change Size command.)

2. Reboot the computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.

3. When the "Starting MS-DOS..." prompt is displayed, press CTRL+F5.

4. Install AutoSketch on drive C (the uncompressed host drive, which was
  previously drive H).

5. Reboot the computer by pressing CTRL+ALT+DEL.
