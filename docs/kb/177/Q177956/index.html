SYMPTOMS
========

There are a number of non-trivial interoperability issues between Exchange 5.0
and 5.5 in RTF to HTML and Imail. Some of the issues are the following:

1. If you create an HTML in any codepage OTHER then ANSI / ISO-8859-1 and put
  some international characters between &lt;TT&gt; and &lt;/TT&gt;. Then
  convert the HTML round trip HTML-&gt;RTF-&gt;HTML the International
  characters between &lt;TT&gt;&gt; and &lt;/TT&gt; are corrupted. This
  corruption is permanent and can't be fixed y changing the browser character
  set or font.

2. After HTML-&gt;RTF conversion, an extra space at the line following
  &lt;Hn&gt;...&lt;/Hn&gt; is emitted.

3. Loss of background color and bad formatting of table cells. Incorrect
  handling of &lt;TD&gt; ... &lt;TD&gt; sequence (with no &lt;/TD&gt;).

4. The background color information is appended as text output after HTML-
  &gt;RTF-&gt;TEXT conversion.

5. The Body tag property is corrupted when converted to Unicode.

6. There is corruption of the &lt;TITLE&gt; tag of an embedded message when
  converting to Unicode.

7. Foreign mail using extended Latin characters gets sent as US-ASCII with all
  the accents stripped.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem Microsoft Exchange Server version
5.0.

This problem has been corrected in the latest U.S. Service Pack for Microsoft
Exchange Server version 5.0. For information on obtaining the Service Pack,
query on the following word in the Microsoft Knowledge Base (without the
spaces):

MORE INFORMATION
================

The same corruption happens for any HTML tag implying monospace font, i.e.,
&lt;TT&gt;, &lt;KBD&gt;, &lt;SAMP&gt;, and &lt;CODE&gt;. The problem is caused
by not marking the monospace font (second font in RTF font table) with the
correct character set, which means the font is treated as ANSI.

Since cell formatting is independent of the formatting outside of the table (IE
and NN behavior), we now save and restore overlapping tag stack around tables
and emit \plain keyword in RTF at the table start. Also, we make sure any new
cell terminates the previous one and any cell formatting is ind pendent of each
other (e.g., FONT started and not terminated in one cell does not propagate to
the next one).

RTF keywords \background and \shpinst needed to be marked as IGNORABLE, so that
the destination gets ignored for plain text processing when in the encapsulated
range.

Now we have better codepage detection. In ambiguous cases (when the character
fits into multiple codepages),we use the non-Western one. Specifically, if you
compose a message using a non-Western character set on a machine set to the
Western locale, we will use that character set even if the first nternational
character encountered fits into Western codepage.
