SUMMARY
=======

The TreeView control supports drag-and-drop. When a Node is dragged to the top
or bottom of the control, the control does not automatically scroll vertically.
Because the control does not support scrolling when doing drag- and-drop,
scrolling must be implemented by the developer. This article demonstrates one
way to implement scrolling when performing drag-and-drop.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following example uses API calls to scroll the TreeView when the mouse
pointer gets close to the bottom or top of the control and you are doing a
drag-and-drop of a Node.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Create a new standard EXE project.Form1 is created by default.

2. Click Components on the Project menu. Check "Microsoft Windows Common
  Controls 5.0."

3. Add a Treeview, ImageList, and Timer to Form1.

4. Right-click the ImageList Control and select Properties from the pop-up menu.

5. On the General Tab of the Property Pages dialog, select 16 x 16.

6. Click the Images Tab, and insert 2 ICO files. NOTE: Icon files can be found
  in the directory ..\VB\Graphics\Icon.

7. Add the following code to the Code Window of Form1:

        Option Explicit

        Private Declare Function SendMessage Lib "user32" Alias _
          "SendMessageA" (ByVal hwnd As Long, _
          ByVal wMsg As Long, ByVal wParam As Long, lParam As Any) As Long
        Dim mfX As Single
        Dim mfY As Single
        Dim moNode As Node
        Dim m_iScrollDir As Integer 'Which way to scroll
        Dim mbFlag As Boolean

        Private Sub Form_DragOver(Source As Control, x As Single, y As _
          Single, State As Integer)
           If Source.Name = "TreeView1" Then
              Timer1.Enabled = False
           End If
        End Sub

        Private Sub Form_Load()
           Dim i As Integer
           Dim n As Integer
           Timer1.Enabled = False
           Timer1.Interval = 200
           TreeView1.Style = tvwTreelinesPlusMinusPictureText
           TreeView1.ImageList = ImageList1
           'Populate TreeView controls
           For i = 1 To 50
             TreeView1.Nodes.Add Text:="Node " &amp; i, Image:=1, _
                SelectedImage:=2
           Next i
           For i = 1 To 50
             For n = 1 To 5
                TreeView1.Nodes.Add Relative:=i, Relationship:=tvwChild, _
                 Text:="Child Node " &amp; n, _
                 Image:=1, SelectedImage:=2
             Next n
           Next i
        End Sub

        Private Sub Timer1_Timer()
           Set TreeView1.DropHighlight = TreeView1.HitTest(mfX, mfY)
           If m_iScrollDir = -1 Then 'Scroll Up
           ' Send a WM_VSCROLL message 0 is up and 1 is down
             SendMessage TreeView1.hwnd, 277&amp;, 0&amp;, vbNull
           Else 'Scroll Down
             SendMessage TreeView1.hwnd, 277&amp;, 1&amp;, vbNull
           End If
        End Sub

        Private Sub TreeView1_DragDrop(Source As Control, x As Single, _
          y As Single)
        ' If you were moving the Node you dragged to be the child
        ' of the Node you dropped it on, you would need to
        ' make moNode the selected Node after you made it a child
          If Not TreeView1.DropHighlight Is Nothing Then
            MsgBox moNode.Text &amp; " was dropped on " &amp; _
            TreeView1.DropHighlight.Text
          End If
          Set TreeView1.DropHighlight = Nothing
          Set moNode = Nothing
          Timer1.Enabled = False
        End Sub

        Private Sub TreeView1_DragOver(Source As Control, x As Single, _
        y As Single, State As Integer)
          Set TreeView1.DropHighlight = TreeView1.HitTest(x, y)
          mfX = x
          mfY = y
          If y &gt; 0 And y &lt; 100 Then 'scroll up
            m_iScrollDir = -1
            Timer1.Enabled = True
          ElseIf y &gt; (TreeView1.Height - 200) And y &lt; TreeView1.Height Then
          'scroll down
            m_iScrollDir = 1
            Timer1.Enabled = True
          Else
            Timer1.Enabled = False
          End If
        End Sub

        Private Sub TreeView1_MouseUp(Button As Integer, Shift As Integer, _
        x As Single, y As Single)
         Timer1.Enabled = False
        End Sub

        Private Sub TreeView1_MouseDown(Button As Integer, Shift As _
        Integer, x As Single, y As Single)
         TreeView1.DropHighlight = TreeView1.HitTest(x, y)
         'Make sure we are over a Node
         If Not TreeView1.DropHighlight Is Nothing Then
            TreeView1.SelectedItem = TreeView1.HitTest(x, y)
            Set moNode = TreeView1.SelectedItem ' Set the item being dragged.
         End If
         Set TreeView1.DropHighlight = Nothing
        End Sub

        Private Sub TreeView1_MouseMove(Button As Integer, Shift As _
        Integer, x As Single, y As Single)
         If Button = vbLeftButton Then
            TreeView1.DragIcon = TreeView1.SelectedItem.CreateDragImage
            TreeView1.Drag vbBeginDrag
         End If
        End Sub

8. Save and run the sample. Select a Node and then drag it to the bottom of the
  TreeView. You will see the TreeView scroll.
