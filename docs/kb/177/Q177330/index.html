-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SUMMARY
=======

This article contains information on how to set the Microsoft Outlook Web Access
(OWA) default calendar settings when you log on to your mailbox for the first
time.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The OWA client supports two calendar backends:

- Outlook Calendar

- Schedule+

When you connect to your Microsoft Exchange Server mailbox, the OWA client tries
to automatically detect the appropriate scheduling backend being used by your
mailbox. However, autodetection does not occur if you have never accessed your
mailbox.

If your mailbox has never been used (and therefore contains no schedule data),
the OWA client creates an Outlook Calendar folder by default, even if your
mailbox is configured to use Microsoft Schedule+ as the scheduling backend.

To specify which scheduling backend is used when you log on to your mailbox for
the first time via the OWA client, follow these steps:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and Delete
Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" Help topics in
Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Start Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

2. Select the following key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Messaging Subsystem

3. Select Add Value from the Edit menu and enter the following information:

     Value Name: AMDefaultCalendar
     Data Type: REG_DWORD

4. Click OK.

5. Enter the following data values based on the type of default calendar your
  organization uses:

     0 - Use this value to use the Outlook Calendar
     1 - Use this value to use Schedule+

This Registry setting will force the OWA client to use the specified scheduling
backend when you log on to your Microsoft Exchange Server mailbox for the first
time. Therefore, if everyone in your organization is using Microsoft Schedule+,
the OWA client can be configured to default to Schedule+, instead of Outlook
Calendar.

NOTE: If you have logged on to your mailbox at least one time, your current
calendar settings are used, and the above registry entries are ignored.

You can also change the calendar backend by setting the "Use Microsoft Schedule+
as my primary calendar" option. This setting can be accessed through the Options
icon on the Outlook Bar of the OWA client.
