The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Access Developer's Toolkit, version 7.0 
- Microsoft Office 97 Developer Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Advanced: Requires expert coding, interoperability, and multiuser skills.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use an ActiveX control in a Microsoft Access application, the control
may appear blank when the application is used in the run-time environment. You
may also receive the following error messages

  Run-time error '438': Object doesn't support this property or method

-or-

  Run-time error '2683': There is no object in this control

-or-

  Run-time error '2455': Application-defined or object-defined error

followed by:

  Execution of this application has stopped due to a run-time error. The
  application can't continue and will be shut down.

Your application then quits. The error you receive depends on both the ActiveX
control and the version of the developer tools that you are using to distribute
the application.

CAUSE
=====

You have pasted a copy of an existing ActiveX control into your form.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can resolve this error by deleting the failing control from the form and
adding a new control from the Insert menu. You should then rename the newly
placed control to the same name as the old control so that any code existing on
the form will work properly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open Microsoft Access and create a blank database.

2. Import the Customers, Employees, and Orders tables from the Northwind sample
  database. The default location for the Northwind database is:

  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Samples\Northwind.mdb

3. Create a blank form, insert a Listview control and name it ListV.

4. Type or paste the following code into the form's code module.

  Private Sub Form_Load()

  Dim clmX As ColumnHeader, mydb As Database, myrs As Recordset
  Dim itmX As ListItem

  Set mydb = CurrentDb
  Set myrs = mydb.OpenRecordset("Customers", dbOpenDynaset)
  Set clmX = ListV.ColumnHeaders.Add(, , "Company", ListV.Width / 3)
  Set clmX = ListV.ColumnHeaders.Add(, , "Address", ListV.Width / 3)
  Set clmX = ListV.ColumnHeaders.Add(, , "Phone", ListV.Width / 3)
  ListV.BorderStyle = ccFixedSingle

  While Not myrs.EOF

    Set itmX = ListV.ListItems.Add(, , CStr(myrs!CompanyName))
   
    If Not IsNull(myrs!Address) Then
      itmX.SubItems(1) = CStr(myrs!Address) ' Address field.
    End If

    If Not IsNull(myrs!Phone) Then
      itmX.SubItems(2) = myrs!Phone  ' Phone field.
    End If

    myrs.MoveNext

    Wend

  ListV.View = lvwReport

  End Sub

  Private Sub ListV_ColumnClick(ByVal ColumnHeader As Object)

  ListV.SortKey = ColumnHeader.Index - 1
  ListV.Sorted = True

  End Sub

  Private Sub ListV_ItemClick(ByVal Item As Object)

      Select Case Item.Index

      Case Is &lt;= 15
          Exit Sub

      Case Is &gt;= 15
          ' Toggle Ghosted property.
          Item.Ghosted = Abs(Item.Ghosted) - 1

  End Select

  End Sub

5. Save the form as ListVForm.

6. Open the form. The list should display without errors.

7. Create a new blank form and copy the ListV control from the previously saved
  form.

  NOTE: It is important that you copy only the control, not the whole form. Do
  not insert the control from the Insert menu.

8. Type or paste the code listed in step 4 into this new form.

9. Save the form as ListVCTlCopy.

10. Open the form. The list should display without errors.

11. Create a new form with a command button to open the ListVForm form and
  another command button to open the ListVCtlCopy form.

12. Save this form as MenuForm and in the Startup dialog box make it the Display
  Form.

13. Create a distribution disk set using the Setup Wizard and distribute the
  application to a clean Windows 95 computer. Make sure to include the ActiveX
  control file (.ocx) in the list of distribution files.

When you run this application on the clean computer, the ListVForm form will work
without any errors, but the ListVCtlCopy form will produce the errors described
in the "Symptoms" section of this article.
