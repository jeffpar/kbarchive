The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Enterprise Edition, versions 5.0, 6.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When starting Microsoft Developer Studio, the following error is displayed:

  DEVBCPX - This required file cannot be loaded. Please re-install Microsoft
  Developer Studio"

This error may be generated if you have a dual-boot machine and Numega's Bounds
Checker is installed. Even if Developer Studio is reinstalled, the error still
occurs.

NOTE: The same error occurs when Bounds Checker is uninstalled.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs if Developer Studio cannot load the Devbcpx.pkg file. This
file is installed by Numega's software package BoundsChecker, which is
integrated with Developer Studio. This error is generated if you have a
dual-boot machine for Microsoft Windows NT version 4.0 and Microsoft Windows 95,
and BoundsChecker is installed in only one operating system and Visual C++
Developer Studio is installed on both the operating systems in a common folder
on the hard drive. The file Devbcpx.pkg is installed in the
DevStudio\SharedIDE\Bin\Ide folder. When starting Developer Studio, Msdev.exe
tries to locate the Devbcpx.pkg file through the registry entry and if
BoundsChecker is not installed for the operating system in which the machine is
booted, the error occurs.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can use one of the following options to resolve this problem depending on
your requirements.

Option 1
--------

Use this option if you are using a dual-boot machine and you want to use both
Visual C++ Developer Studio and BoundsChecker, and you are getting this error
when you try to use Developer Studio in only one of the operating systems.

The resolution for the above configuration is to install BoundsChecker also for
the operating system where the error has occurred.

Option 2
--------

Use this option if you are the only user of the machine and you have no intention
of using BoundsChecker.

The resolution is to uninstall Visual C++, and verify the following information.

For Visual C++, version 5.0:

  Verify that the the directories DevStudio\SharedIDE\Bin and DevStudio\Vc\Bin
  are empty. Also, ensure that the following registry keys are deleted if you
  find them:

     HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\DevStudio
     HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Infoviewer\5.0
     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\DevStudio
     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Infoviewer\5.0

For Visual C++, version 6.0:

  Verify that the directories [Visual Studio Path]\Common\MSDEV98\Bin and
  [Visual Studio Path]\VC98\Bin are empty. Also, ensure that the following
  registry keys are deleted if you find them:

     HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\DevStudio\6.0
     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\DevStudio\6.0

Then reinstall Visual C++. If you installed the MSDN Library before, it is
advisable that you reinstall the MSDN Library also after reinstalling Visual
C++.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
