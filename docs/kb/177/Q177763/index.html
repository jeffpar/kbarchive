SUMMARY
=======

This article is a troubleshooting guide to use when an attempt to generate the
offline address book (OAB) fails with errors.

One or more of the following errors may occur. Note that other symptoms besides
the ones listed may also occur.

- Event ID 5004: Generation of the offline Address Book is complete.
  Result: The MAPI call failed.&lt;&lt;80004005&gt;&gt;.

- Event ID 5012: Failed to generate offline address book for container: /.
  Results: An unexpected, unknown error occurred. 8004010b.

- The clients can download the Offline Address Book, without any errors.

- You get the same Event IDs connecting locally and remotely.

- You may also see Errors 1232 or 1233.

Troubleshooting Procedure
-------------------------

To troubleshoot, perform the following steps:

1. Ensure that you are logged on as a user with at least Administrator
  permissions at the Organization, Site, and Configuration levels. If not,
  change the permissions or log on as someone with those permissions, and then
  attempt to generate the Offline Address Book. Ensure that the offline address
  book server is the server you are connected to when generating the OAB.

2. Ensure that the Offline Address Book folder is listed in the Folders on this
  Information Store option. To confirm whether it is listed, perform the
  following steps:

  a. In the Administrator window, click Servers, and select a server.

  b. Double-click Public Information Store.

  c. Click Instances.

  If the OAB is not listed, add it to this location and allow time for it to
  replicate. You should be able to view the properties of the OAB. Now try
  generating the Address Book.


3. If steps 1 and 2 both fail, try generating the OAB on different servers in
  the site. To do this, use these steps:

  a. Connect to the Exchange Administrator program on another server, and then
     change the OAB server entry to the new server.

  b. In the Administrator window, click Configuration, and then double- click
     DS Site Configuration.

  c. Click Offline Address Book and change the OAB server entry to the new
     server.

  d. Try to generate the OAB.

4. Next try different containers (Recipients, Custom, or Global Address List).
  Also, create a new container to test.

5. Start the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator program in raw mode.

  WARNING: Using raw mode of Exchange Server Administrator incorrectly can cause
  serious problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT Server and/or
  Exchange Server. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems resulting from the
  incorrect use of raw mode can be solved. Use raw mode at your own risk.

  Expand the site that contains the server. In the Configuration container,
  expand the Information Store Site Configuration. On the File menu, click Raw
  Properties. Check the server name listed for Site- Folder-Server, making sure
  that there is a Replica of the offline address book on this server, and that
  you can access the properties while you are connected to this server. If not,
  follow the instructions in step 2, and then try generating the Address Book.

6. If steps 3,4, and 5 fail, restart the Exchange Services in Control Panel.
  Double-click the Services icon, and run DS/IS consistency adjustment on the
  server indicated in Site-Folder-Server.

  NOTE: Do not perform the DS/IS consistency adjustment if the replication
  connection has been broken and will be reconnected later or if Directory
  Replication is occurring.

  Now try generating the OAB.

7. Check to see if there is more than one Language Template installed in any
  site. To verify this:

  a. Connect to one server in each site.

  b. Double-click the site name.

  c. Under the Site globe, click Configuration, Addressing, Details, Templates.

  This can also be verified at the following location:
  Configuration/Addressing/One-Off Address Templates.

  If more than one language is listed, make sure the server generating the OAB
  has the same languages installed in its site. When this situation exists, it
  can be resolved by either removing the additional language(s) from the other
  sites or installing the language templates in the site that is having
  problems generating the OAB.

8. Check the version of the Mapi32.dll file. It should match the appropriate
  version of Exchange Server. The version numbers can be verified according to
  the instructions in Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q172036, "INFO: MAPI
  Version Cross Reference."


9. Shut down the Exchange Server computer and restart it. There may be an issue
  involving cached information or a locked open file that's needed for address
  book generation.

10. If all of the above steps seem to result in the same errors and/or events,
  it will be necessary to implement Guidgen on the Exchange Server computer.

CAUTION: The Guidgen utility should be used with caution. Guidgen will rebuild
(erase) all the site folders. Before using Guidgen, Oabgen.dll may be the better
solution.

NOTE: At each step, check the application log for errors. Run the Guidgen utility
on the server that will become the new Site-Folder-Server. This will delete the
existing Offline Address Book. After this has been successfully done, the
Information Store on each server in the site, must be stopped and restarted
before generating the offline address Book.
