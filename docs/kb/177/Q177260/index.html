-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Executing a REPORT FORM command while an application is running minimized, sets
focus to the application and restores the application's window. After the REPORT
FORM command finishes executing, the application loses focus and continues
running minimized.

RESOLUTION
==========

Setting the visible property of the form to false before the REPORT FORM command
is executed prevents the form from being restored and displayed on screen.

The following code snippet illustrates changing the visible property before and
after a REPORT FORM command is encountered. In the example below, this code
would appear in the Timer Event method of the timer object.

     ThisForm.Visible=.F.
     REPORT FORM prtsrv FOR RECNO() &lt; 5 TO PRINT NOCONSOLE NOWAIT
     ThisForm.Visible=.T.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When an application compiled with Visual FoxPro version 5.0 is running as a
minimized background process and a REPORT FORM command is encountered, the
application's window is restored from its minimized state and displayed on
screen. After the REPORT FORM command has finished executing, the application's
window is minimized and the application continues executing as a background
process.

Applications compiled with Visual FoxPro version 3.0 that are running as a
minimized background process remain minimized when a REPORT FORM command is
encountered.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Using Visual FoxPro version 5.0, create a new project called Prtsrv.

2. Click Data, Databases and add the Testdata database from the VFP\Samples\Data
  folder.

3. Click Documents, Reports and create a new quick report using the Customer
  table of the Testdata database. Save the report as Prtsrv.

4. Click Code, Programs and create a new program file named Prtsrv with the
  following code:

        PUBLIC rollcounter
        rollcounter=0
        DO FORM prtsrv
        READ EVENTS

        _SCREEN.WINDOWSTATE=2
        _SCREEN.VISIBLE=.T.
        _SCREEN.SHOW
        ZOOM WINDOW SCREEN MAX

5. Set Prtsrv.prg as the main program file.

6. Click Documents, Forms and create a new form called Prtsrv with the following
  properties:

        AutoCenter = .T.
        Height     = 130
        ShowWindow = 2
        Width      = 192

7. In the form's Activate event, add the following code:

        _SCREEN.WINDOWSTATE=1
        _SCREEN.VISIBLE=.f.
        HIDE WINDOW SCREEN
        thiswin=WONTOP()
        ZOOM WINDOW &amp;thiswin MIN

8. Add a Timer control to the form with the following properties:

        Interval=3000

9. Add the following code to the Timer Event method of the timer object:

        rollcounter=rollcounter+1
        REPORT FORM prtsrv FOR RECNO()  &lt; 5 TO PRINT NOCONSOLE NOWAIT
        IF rollcounter=3
        ThisForm.Command1.Click
        ENDIF

10. Add a command button to the form with the following code in the Click event
  of the command button:

        RELEASE THISFORM
        CLEAR EVENTS

11. From the Project Manager, build an executable file. Open Windows Explorer
  and double-click the executable file. At 30 second intervals, the Prtsrv
  form is restored and visible on screen.
