The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you double-click Add New Hardware in Control Panel, you may receive the
following error message:

  Rundll32 caused a General Protection Fault in module Setupx.dll.

CAUSE
=====

You may receive this error message if there is a damaged .inf file in the
Windows\Inf folder.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, find and delete the damaged .inf file in the Windows\Inf
folder. To do so, follow these steps:

1. Verify that you can view hidden and system files.

For additional information about how to do this, click the article number below
to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q141276 How to View System and Hidden Files in Windows

2. Determine the date of your original Windows system files. To do so, follow
  these steps:

  a. Click Start, point to Find, and then click "Files Or Folders".

  b. In the Named box, type "win.com" (without the quotation marks), and then
     click "Find Now".

  c. Right-click the Win.com file in your Windows folder, and then click
     Properties.

  d. Note the date on the Modified line. This is the date of your original
     Windows system files.

3. Click Start, point to Find, and then click "Files Or Folders".

4. In the Named box, type "inf" (without the quotation marks), and then click
  Find Now.

5. Double-click the Inf folder.

6. Move all of the .inf files that do not have the same date as your original
  Windows system files into a new folder. For information about how to create a
  new folder, click Start, click Help, click the Index tab, type "creating
  folders" (without the quotation marks), and then click Display. For
  information about how to move files, click Start, click Help, click the Index
  tab, type "moving files" (without the quotation marks), and then click
  Display.

7. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

8. Double-click Add New Hardware, and follow the instructions on the screen. If
  you do not receive the error message, skip to step 10.

9. If you receive the error message when you run the Add New Hardware wizard,
  move the .inf files back into the Inf folder, and then reinstall Windows 95.

For additional information about how to reinstall Windows 95, click the article
number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q149712 How to Install Windows 95: Helpful Tips and Suggestions

10. If you do not receive the error message when you run the Add New Hardware
  wizard, the damaged .inf file is one of the files you moved in step 6. To
  identify the damaged .inf file, move the .inf files back into the Inf folder
  one at a time (noting the name of the .inf file you are moving), and then
  repeat steps 7-8. Repeat this process until you receive the error message
  again. When you receive the error message again, the last .inf file you
  moved is the damaged .inf file. To determine where this file originated,
  double-click the file and note any manufacturer, version, or date
  information that may indicate the origin of the file. After you determine
  the origin of the file, delete the file, and then reinstall it from the
  original installation disks or CD-ROM.
