IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it
if a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

Client Services for NetWare (CSNW) does not handle files correctly when it
receives the packet burst in the wrong order.

When this happens, CSNW and Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW) actually issue a
CloseFileRequest prior to the entire file being transferred, resulting in an
incomplete file being loaded.

A subsequent save will overlay the good file on the NetWare server, resulting in
lost data.

This behavior also causes the CSNW or GSNW open file (either a Word or Excel
document) that is located on the NetWare server to be extremely slow if the
NetWare server is on a Wide Area Network (WAN) and the routers are configured
with Multi path.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall Windows. Microsoft cannot guarantee that problems
resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use Registry
Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

Reduce the NWLink packet size or change the Router configuration. To do this,
perform the following steps:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), and go to the following subkey:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\NWLinkIPX
  \NetConfig\Driverx

  NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

2. Edit the following information:

  MaxPktSize     REG_DWORD

  Range: 0 to 65535

  Default: 0

3. Quit Registry Editor and restart your computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The registry key mentioned above specifies the maximum frame size the network
adapter card is allowed to transmit. If this number is 0, NWLink gets this
information from the card driver.

This value entry allows the administrator to make the maximum transmit size for a
card smaller than the card driver allows. A scenario in which you might want to
change this entry is in an environment in which the network adapter card on one
side of a conversation is on a link that has a larger frame size than the link
on the other side of a conversation.

For example, if the sending station is linked to a 16 Mbps Token Ring and the
receiving station is linked to an Ethernet network, go to the following registry
key and change the information as shown below:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe), and go to the following subkey:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Parameters

2. Add the following value:

  DefaultMaxPacketSize:REG_DWORD: (Using Decimal value that matches the
  MAXPKTSIZE value)

  -or-

Change the router configuration:

  Parameter MAXPATH=1.

This requires that the path to one computer will be the same (this is not a good
choice because routers are configured with multiple paths to insure network
reliability).
