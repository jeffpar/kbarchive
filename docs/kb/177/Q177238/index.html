SUMMARY
=======

This article illustrates how to use the hyperlink object from a UserDocument
(Visual Basic Active Document) to navigate to another document. It demonstrates
the following:

1. How to use the Hyperlink.NavigateTo.

2. How to use Parent.LocationURL.

3. How to construct an absolute URL.

4. Why Parent.LocationName and App.Path are not suitable for this purpose.

MORE INFORMATION
================

From your UserDocument, you can jump to other UserDocuments that are in your
application (Internal Jumping) or you can jump to other Web locations or
documents (External Jumping). In both cases, you use the Hyperlink object's
NavigateTo method and supply an absolute URL to where you want to jump. For
example, you can do the following from your UserDocument code:

     Hyperlink.NavigateTo "http://www.microsoft.com"

This will cause Internet Explorer to navigate to the specified location. You can
also use this method for jumping to other UserDocuments in your application.

Because you have to specify an absolute URL, using this approach for other
UserDocuments on a Web site requires extra work. You need to know the full URL
from which the document (.vbd) was launched. You can get this information using
Parent.LocationURL from your UserDocument code. The location can be either a Web
URL or a UNC file location name.

NOTE: You should use the Parent.LocationURL property for retrieving the location
of the UserDocument. Parent.LocationURL, unlike Parent.LocationName, works
identically in both Internet Explorer 3 and Internet Explorer 4. In Internet
Explorer 3, LocationName returns the complete path just as LocationURL does. In
Internet Explorer 4, LocationName does not always return a complete path.

You should only use App.Path when the document is loaded from the local computer
because it returns the location where your EXE or DLL exists locally, not the
location from which the document was downloaded.

Constructing an Absolute URL
----------------------------

As mentioned before, you need an absolute URL for Hyperlink.NavigateTo method.
This can be tricky for jumping to other UserDocuments in your application
because the UserDocuments can reside on a local (or network) file share or on a
Web server. The following function accepts the new URL in the form of a string.
This URL can be either a relative or an absolute path. The function returns an
absolute URL in the form of a string that can be passed to the NavigateTo
function:

      Function PathFromURL(iURL As String) As String
      '   Function Name:  PathFromURL
      '   Pass in a single filename (iURL) and return the full path to that
      '   file. This works when you run on a local computer (for testing 
      '   purposes or running from IDE) or when running from a Web server.
      
      Dim navPath As String
      Dim intLocal As Integer
          
      '   Check if there is an absolute URL being passed in.
      '   If so, return that URL.
      
      If InStr(iURL, "://") Or InStr(iURL, ":\\") Then
          PathFromURL = iURL
      Else
          '   Find the last "/"
          intLocal = InStrRev(UserDocument.Parent.locationname, "/")
          
          If (intLocal = 0) Then
          '   If there is not a "/", we are running on the local computer.
              navPath = App.Path
          Else
          '   We are running on the Web server, use locationname to get
          '   the current path.
              navPath = Left(UserDocument.Parent.locationname, intLocal - 1)
          End If
          
          '   Append the requested file name to the path for the
          '   absolute URL.
          PathFromURL = navPath &amp; "/" &amp; iURL
      End If
      End Function

As an example, suppose you have a Doc1.VBD and a Doc2.VBD stored on a server at
http://demo/hyperlink, but you do not want to hardcode the server name in your
code so that these VBD files can be moved easily from one server location to
another. To jump from Doc1.vbd to Doc2.vbd, you can use the above function as
follows:

     Hyperlink.NavigateTo PathFromURL("doc2.vbd")

Because PathFromURL can work on both URLs and UNC, this technique will work in
both cases without changing code.
