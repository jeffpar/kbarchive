- Page 13: Text correction

- Page 70: Typographical Error

MORE INFORMATION
================

Page xxx: Incorrect Web Address
-------------------------------

On page xxx, the Web address given for "Building Applications with Microsoft
Access 97" is incorrect.

Page 30, last paragraph, last sentence:

Change:

  http://www.microsoft.com/accessdev/buildapp/

To:

  http://www.microsoft.com/AccessDev/Articles/BApp97/BApp97.htm


Page 13: Text correction
------------------------

Page 13, under "Adding an Object to your Application", last sentence in the
paragraph:

Change:
"You can create this form easily by using the Report Wizard."

To:
"You can create this report easily by using the Report Wizard."


Page 70: Typographical Error
----------------------------

On page 70, toward the bottom of the page in Step 2, change "Records" to
"Contacts".

Change:
"The form now displays only contacts in Seattle. But the option group still shows
All Records - which is no longer true!"

To:
"The form now displays only contacts in Seattle. But the option group still shows
All Contacts - which is no longer true!"


Page 200: Subscription Database Out Of Date
-------------------------------------------

The code on page 200 compares the current date with a date listed in the
PaidThrough column of the Subscription database. Because this book was published
in 1997, these dates are now too old to be useful.

You can correct the problem by using the following steps:

1. In Microsoft Access 97, load 08Subscr.mdb.

2. In the Database window, select the Tables tab.

3. Double-click the Subscribers table.

4. If necessary, use the scroll bar at the bottom right of the window to scroll
  to the PaidThrough column.

5. Subtract 1997 from the current year. For example, 2000 - 1997 = 3 years.

6. Add the number of years since 1997 to each entry in the PaidThrough column.

7. Save and close the database.

8. Repeat steps 1-7 for 09Subscr.mdb, 10Subscr.mdb, and 11Subscr.mdb.

Additional information on this issue is provided in the note on page 204.


Page 325: In Step 5, Minimize Word Rather Than Close It
-------------------------------------------------------

On page 325, in step 5, you will need to minimize Word rather than close it,
because Word needs to be open when you follow the instructions on page 332 to
create a Word memo. If Word is not open when you perform step 3 on page 332, you
will receive the error message "Run Time Error 429 ActiveX component can't
create object."

Change step 5 on page 325 from:
"On the File menu, click Exit. Word closes, and Microsoft Access returns to the
front."

To:
"Minimize Word so that Microsoft Access returns to the front."


Pages 358 - 359: Steps Result in Error
--------------------------------------

Following the steps on pages 358-359 allows the code to compile but returns the
following error message:

  There is no object in this control.

Microsoft Access 97 does not recognize the Navigate method. However, Microsoft
Access 2000 does.


Page 366: Incorrect URL
-----------------------

On page 366, the URL to view Building Applications with Microsoft Access 97 is
incorrect.

Change:
http://www.microsoft.com/accessdev/docs/bapp97/bapp97.htm

To:
http://www.microsoft.com/accessdev/articles/bapp97/bapp97.htm
