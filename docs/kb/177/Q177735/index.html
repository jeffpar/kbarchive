-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade to Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 Service Pack 3
(SP3) from Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2), you are
unable to access the Microsoft Exchange Administrator program either locally or
remotely. You may experience the following symptoms:

- When you attempt to access the Exchange Administrator program, and you Select
  Browse, you receive the following message:

  Microsoft Exchange Administrator

  The list of Microsoft Exchange Server computers is not available
  because no Microsoft Exchange Server computer could be located.

  Microsoft Exchange Administrator
  ID no c10312c8

  When you manually type the name of the Exchange Server, you receive the error
  message:

  DS_E_COMMUNICATIONS_PROBLEM, connection to the Microsoft Exchange
  Server Computer could not be made

  -or-

- When you use the Compaq NetFlex-3 network card, network connectivity to a
  computer is intermittently lost and then restored every few minutes without
  having to restart the system.

  -or-

- Depending on the application, the client or application may have to be
  restarted to restore the connection. If the application has open files on the
  server during this problem, data may be lost.

  -or-

- Some applications report the lost connections. Others applications may seem
  to stop responding (hang) for several minutes before continuing.

CAUSE
=====

This occurs because Windows NT Server does not detect the newest Compaq
NetFlex-3 adapter card during setup. The drivers for the newer cards have the
same name as the drivers for the old NetFlex-3 cards, and also work with the old
NetFlex-3 cards. Replacing the old NetFlex-3 drivers with the new NetFlex-3
drivers in the I386\Drvlib.nic folder does not allow the new drivers to be
loaded for the old cards.

RESOLUTION
==========

Compaq has supplied a new Ntoemdh.inf file that allows Windows NT to detect and
load the drivers for these new cards, and allows the new drivers to be loaded
for the older NetFlex-3 cards as well.

NOTE: For information on the latest versions of the adapter card drivers, contact
the manufacturer.
