- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a recorded macro that performs the following actions:

- Changes to Outline View

- Saves the file

- Closes the document

- Opens the document

the following error message appears:

  Run-time error '4248':

  This command is not available because no document is open.

CAUSE
=====

The "ActiveWindow.ActivePane.View.Type=wdOutlineView" statement is recorded a
second time in the macro when the document is closed.

WORKAROUND
==========

Comment or delete the second occurrence of the following statement in the
recorded macro:

     ActiveWindow.ActivePane.View.Type = wdOutlineView

NOTE: The second occurrence of this statement in the sample macro in the "More
Information" section of this article immediately follows the
"ActiveDocument.Close" statement.

To Comment the Problematic Line of Code
---------------------------------------

Visual Basic ignores comments when it runs your procedures. Comment lines begin
with an apostrophe (') or with Rem followed by a space, and can be added
anywhere in a procedure. Follow these steps to convert the problematic line of
code to a comment:

1. In the open document, point to Macro on the Tools menu, and then click
  Macros.

2. Select the recorded macro, and then click Edit.

3. In the Visual Basic Editor, select the line of macro code that you want to
  convert to a comment.

4. On the View menu, point to Toolbars, and then click Edit.

5. On the Edit toolbar, click the Comment Block button. The line of macro code
  should now look similar to the following:

     ' ActiveWindow.ActivePane.View.Type = wdOutlineView

  Note the apostrophe at the beginning of the line.

6. On the File menu, click Close and Return to Microsoft Word.

To Delete the Problematic Line of Code
--------------------------------------

1. In the open document, point to Macro on the Tools menu, and then click
  Macros.

2. Select the recorded macro, and then click Edit.

3. In the Visual Basic Editor, select the line of macro code you want to delete.

4. On the Edit menu, click Cut.

5. On the File menu, click Close and Return to Microsoft Word.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
