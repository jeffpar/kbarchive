The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Office 97 Standard Edition for Windows 
- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you print a Microsoft Word 97 document from Windows Explorer by right-
clicking the document and clicking Print on the shortcut menu, the following
error message appears:

  The instruction at "0x3000A7C6" referenced memory at "0xFFFFFFFF". The memory
  could not be "read".

CAUSE
=====

This type of error can occur when the Word document contains code in the
Document_Open event or AutoOpen macro that changes the Visible property of a
menu or toolbar.

Example:

     Application.CommandBars("standard").Controls("&amp;open...").Visible = False

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, obtain Microsoft Word 97 Service Release 2 (SR-2).

To temporarily work around this problem, use the Delete method rather than
setting the Visible property to False.

For example, you can replace a statement like the following

     Application.CommandBars("standard").Controls("&amp;open...").Visible = False

with:

     CommandBars("standard").Controls(3).Delete
