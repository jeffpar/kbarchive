The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Bookshelf 98 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

messages:

  %1 caused an invalid page fault in module %2 at %3!.04x!:%4!.08x!.

  Bshelf98 caused an invalid page fault in module Bshelf98.exe.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur for any of the following reasons:

- Insufficient free memory is available.
- Virtual memory is disabled.
- Insufficient hard disk space is available.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following methods:

Free Memory and System Resources
--------------------------------

To free memory and system resources that may not have been released by other
programs, restart the computer.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Confirm That Virtual Memory is Enabled
--------------------------------------

To confirm that virtual memory is enabled, use the following steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. On the Performance tab, click Virtual Memory.

4. Click "Let Windows manage my virtual memory settings (recommended)."

5. Click the Disable Virtual Memory (Not Recommended) check box to clear it if
  it is selected.

6. Click OK, and then click Close.

7. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Yes.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Confirm That Sufficient Hard Disk Space is Available
----------------------------------------------------

To confirm that sufficient hard disk space is available on your computer, use the
following steps:

1. Double-click My Computer.

2. Right-click the hard disk on which Windows is installed, and then click
  Properties.

3. On the General tab, note the amount of free space.

4. Click OK.

5. Repeat steps 2-4 for all other hard disks installed on your computer.

6. Close My Computer.

If any hard disk on your computer has 20 megabytes (MB) or more of available
space, configure virtual memory to use the hard disk with the most available
space. To do so, use the following steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. On the Performance tab, click Virtual Memory.

4. Click "Let me specify my own virtual memory settings."

5. In the Hard Disk box, click the hard disk with the largest amount of free
  space.

6. Click OK, and then click Close.

7. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Yes.

If no hard disk on your computer has 20 MB or more of available space, increase
the amount of available space on at least one hard disk. To do so, use one or
more of the following methods:

- Empty the Recycle Bin:

  To empty the Recycle Bin, right-click the Recycle Bin icon on the desktop, and
  then click Empty Recycle Bin. If you are prompted to confirm that you want to
  delete the files, click Yes.

- Back up and delete data files:

  Back up and then remove data on the hard disk. For information about how to
  back up files, click Start, and then click Help. On the Index tab, type
  "backing" (without the quotation marks) and then double-click the "Backing up
  files" topic.

- Delete unnecessary files:

  Delete any unnecessary files from the hard disk. For information about how to
  delete files, click Start, and then click Help. On the Index tab, type
  "deleting" (without the quotation marks), and then double-click the "Deleting
  files or folders" topic.
