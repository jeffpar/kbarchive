-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to apply a service pack to a computer running Microsoft
Exchange Server, you may receive an error message during setup that says some
files are in use, even when no other applications are running. The error message
may be similar to the following:

  Could not open the file named 'C:\EXCHSRVR\BIN\ADDRESS.DLL'. It is in use by
  another application.

CAUSE
=====

The System Attendant is possibly running again. Part of the update and setup
process is to first stop all known Exchange related services; this includes the
System Attendant. However, if there is at least one server monitor running
against the server, the System Attendant can be restarted. This occurs even if:

- The system attendant is not set to be monitored.

- The server monitor is configured to take no action.

- You use ADMIN /T NR to suspend notifications and repairs.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, stop all server monitors that run against the
Exchange Server computer that is being upgraded.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in Microsoft Exchange Server
versions 4.0, 5.0, and 5.5. Mirosoft is researching this issue and will post new
information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
