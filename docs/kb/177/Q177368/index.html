-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Bookshelf 1996-97 for Windows 
- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
- Microsoft Office 97 Professional Edition for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information about how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry Key"
Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use the Lookup Reference feature in Microsoft Word 97 to
access information in Bookshelf 96-97, you may be prompted for the location of
the Bs96se.exe file.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if both Microsoft Bookshelf Basics and Bookshelf 1996-97
are installed on the computer. Bs96se.exe is the executable file for Bookshelf
Basics. Bookshelf Basics is a component of Microsoft Office 97 Professional
Edition.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, remove Bookshelf Basics from the computer. To do so, use
the following steps:

1. Quit all programs that are currently running. To do so, follow these steps:

  a. Restart the computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message,
     press the F8 key, and then choose Command Prompt Only on the Startup menu.

  b. Start Windows 95 by typing "win" (without the quotation marks) and holding
     down the SHIFT key for the duration of Windows startup. This prevents any
     programs from being loaded automatically when Windows starts.

  c. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE to open the Close Program dialog box.

  d. Quit all programs except Explorer and Systray (which are parts of Windows
     95). To quit a program, click the program, and then click End Task.

  e. Repeat steps 3-4 until you have quit all unnecessary programs.

  f. Disable any anti-virus or disk tool programs installed on the computer.
     For information about how to disable these programs, see the printed or
     online documentation for the program.

2. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

3. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

4. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click Microsoft Office 97 Professional Edition,
  and then click Add/Remove.

5. In the Microsoft Office 97 Setup dialog box, click Add/Remove.

6. In the Options box, click the Microsoft Bookshelf Basics check box to clear
  it, and then click Continue.

7. Click Yes, and then click OK until you return to Control Panel.

8. Close Control Panel.

MORE INFORMATION
