-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

There is a new Setup Wizard for Visual FoxPro for Macintosh that runs under OS
8.

The following files are available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  FoxTools.hqx
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/fox26mac/Update/1/MacOS/EN-US/FoxTools.hqx)

For additional information about how to download Microsoft Support files, click
the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Instructions on Using the File
------------------------------

After extracting the Wzsetup.app from the .hqx file, place Wzsetup.app in the
Wizards folder where Visual FoxPro is installed. In Visual FoxPro, run the Setup
Wizard. The new Wzsetup.app should be 854,747 bytes in size. The original
Wzsetup.app was 713,472 bytes. Wzsetup.app and the Readme.txt file are the only
files in the .hqx file.

Background
----------

When Apple released OS 8, the functionality of AppleScript changed in various
ways. Microsoft was unaware of the changes that were going to be made to
AppleScript in OS 8 when Visual FoxPro was released. The Visual FoxPro for
Macintosh Setup Wizard uses AppleScript to copy files and communicate with the
FoxPro Disk Layout Tool. The AppleScript commands in the new Setup Wizard were
modified to be compatible with OS 8. The new Setup Wizard also runs properly in
System software versions prior to OS 8.

For more information on changes in AppleScript in OS 8 contact Apple Computer.

Known Features and Issues with the New Setup Wizard
---------------------------------------------------

The new Setup Wizard automatically includes the Foxtools.cfm and Foxtools.slm
files on the distribution disks. The files will be installed with the
application when it is installed. Since the FoxTools files are automatically
installed, you need to obtain updated copies of the files.
