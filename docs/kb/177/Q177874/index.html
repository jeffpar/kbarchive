Age of Empires Strategy Types
September, 1997
(c) Microsoft Corporation, 1997

The following strategy .ai files are available for use in player-created
scenarios. Files with an .ai extension contain information that guides the
strategy of computer opponents. These files determine what a computer
opponent will research and build, which units will be trained, and in what
quantities. The file also determines whether the computer opponent will
try to build a Wonder. You can use any text editor to modify .ai files.

Below is the complete list of custom .ai files you can use when building
scenarios in Age of Empires. The files are located in the Data folder where
you installed Age of Empires.
