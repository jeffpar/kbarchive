-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you move a user's mailbox from Server A to Server B using the Advanced tab
of mailbox properties, it will appear that the user's Directory Object is still
homed on Server A. But when you check the destination servers Mailbox Resources,
the user's mail appears to have been successfully moved to Server B.

CAUSE
=====

During the Move Mailbox process, the Microsoft Exchange Server Administrator
program performs the following steps:

1. Copies the selected user's mailbox to the selected destination Server.

  NOTE: Move Mailbox only works between servers in the same site.

2. After the mailbox has been successfully moved, a directory synchronization
  request is issued.

During the synchronization process, the Administrator program is passing the same
source and destination server to the Move Mailbox function. As a result the
user's Directory Object does not get moved.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, do one of the following:

- On the Tools menu, click Move Mailbox to move users (instead of using the
  Home Server property in the Advanced tab of the Recipient properties dialog
  box).

- Force Directory Updates within the site, as follows:

  1. In the Administrator program, select the desired server.

  2. On the General tab of the Directory Service properties page, click Update
     Now.
