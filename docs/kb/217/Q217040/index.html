IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

There are three directory synchronization (dirsync)-related mapping rules for
the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Lotus cc:Mail. The first two are discussed
in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q197254 Customize Dirsynced cc:Mail Display and Alias Names

This article describes the mapping rule for mapping information in the Comments
field to Exchange attributes. Note that this applies to both DB6 and DB8 Post
Offices.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By taking advantage of the Comments field in Lotus cc:Mail, it is possible to
automatically map user-specific information such as office location, telephone,
department, and so on to an Exchange Server-equivalent field.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Run the Registry Editor

2. Find the following registry location:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeCCMC\Parameters

3. Add the following value:

+-------------------------------------+
| Value Name   | Dirsync Comment Rule | 
+-------------------------------------+
| Data Type    | String (REG_SZ)      | 
+-------------------------------------+
| String Value | desired string value | 
+-------------------------------------+

The following table lists the recognized parameters:

+--------------------------------------+
| Parameter       | Description        | 
+--------------------------------------+
| %a              | Alias name         | 
+--------------------------------------+
| %d              | Department         | 
+--------------------------------------+
| %o              | Office             | 
+--------------------------------------+
| %p              | Phone              | 
+--------------------------------------+
| %c              | Custom attribute 1 | 
+--------------------------------------+
| ;               | Comment delimiters | 
+--------------------------------------+
| Multiple spaces | Ignored            | 
+--------------------------------------+

For example, in cc:Mail, if you have the rule, %a;%o;%p, and the comment,
jsmith;43/3019;(425) 936-1111, this will map to the Alias, Office, and Phone
fields for that custom recipient. If cc:Mail custom recipients already exist on
the Exchange Server computer, deleting the custom recipients and running dirsync
afterwards may be required for the comments in cc:Mail to mapped over to the
cc:Mail custom recipient on Exchange Server.

In Exchange 5.5 SP3, you can only synchronize the contents of the cc:Mail
Comments field into the Exchange Custom Recipient Notes field, which is located
in the Custom Recipients properties under the Phone/Notes property page.
Meaning, if you have multiple values in the cc:Mail Comments field, and you have
configured the registry per the instructions in this article using mupltiple
parameters, all the contents will be written to the Exchange Custom Recipient's
Notes field. For example, if you were to have the following value in cc:Mail's
Comments field

  425-123-4567;Redmond;JDoe;Human Resources;Assistant

and then you configured the registry value "Dirsync Comment Rule" as follows:

  %p;%o;%a;%d;%c

You would find that this configuration does not work as expected: The entire
comment value would get written to the Exchange Notes field. The value you put
in the registry has no effect; it can even be left blank, and the behavior is
the same.
