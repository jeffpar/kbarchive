-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During the Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 2 update, you may encounter an error
message about failing to upgrade Mdbperf.dll. If you choose to abort the Setup
at this time, the following error will occur when you attempt to rerun the
update or start the Exchange services:

  Dsamain.exe -Entry Point Not Found The procedure entry point
  ?HrRegisterProtocol@@YGJPAVPROTO@@FJJJKHPAXK@Z could not be located in the
  dynamic link library Netif.dll.

CAUSE
=====

The Netif.dll file version was a pre-Service Pack 2 2448 build version.

RESOLUTION
==========

Rename the Netif.dll file on the Exchange Server in the Exchsrvr\Bin directory,
and copy it from the Service Pack 2 CD. In Control Panel, click Services, and
attempt to start the directory service manually. Proceed to the Information
Store and Message Transfer Agent services next.

If a service does not start, you may need to obtain that service executable from
the Service Pack 2 CD. The name of the service executables are:

  System Attendant - Mad.exe
  Directory Service - Dsamain.exe
  Information Store - Store.exe
  Message Transfer Agent - Emsmta.exe

When all of the core services start successfully, you will need to reinstall
Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This error is usually encountered when Mdbperf.dll is in use. This file is
opened by Performance Monitor. It will be necessary to stop all performance
monitors set to run against the server performing the upgrade.

NOTE: Customers may also report the following error message:

  STORE.EXE
  The procedure entry point could not be located in the dynamic link library
  Msvcrt.dll.

Customers should copy the files Store.exe and Msvcrt.dll from the latest service
pack.

NOTE: If you apply the following Store hotfix:

  5.5.2611.9

you also need to apply the following DSA hotfix:

  5.5.2600.0
