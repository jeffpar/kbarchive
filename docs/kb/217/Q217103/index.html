SUMMARY
=======

Web Spiders, often called Robots, are WWW search engines that "crawl" across the
Internet and index pages on Web servers. A Web Spider will then catalog that
information and make it available to the Internet for searching. This makes it
easier for users to find specific information on the Internet by allowing
"one-stop shopping" through the Spider's WWW site. Most Robots also prioritize
documents that are on the Internet, allowing search results to be "scored" or
arranged in order of most likely matches on a search.

A Robots.txt file is a special text file that is always located in your Web
server's root directory. This file contains restrictions for Web Spiders,
telling them where they have permission to search. It should be noted that Web
Robots are not required to respect Robots.txt files, but most well-written Web
Spiders follow the rules you define.

MORE INFORMATION
================

A Robot identifies itself when it browses your site, which is known as the
"User-agent" and appears in the logs for IIS. Generally, the flow of events when
a Web Spider crawls your site is similar to the following:

1. The Robot asks for your /robots.txt file and looks for a "User- agent:" line
  that refers to it specifically.

   - If it finds an entry for itself, such as "User-agent: WebRobot," then it
     follows the rules that pertain to it.

   - If is does not find an entry for itself, it looks for a global set of
     rules, such as "User-agent: *," and obeys those rules.

   - If the Robot has an entry for itself and a global set of rules is also
     present, the Robot's personal rules will supersede the global rules.

2. Rules for a user-agent are set up as "Disallow:" statements that tell a robot
  where it cannot search. A disallow statement is applied to any address that
  may have been requested by the Robot. For example:

   - "Disallow: /test" causes a Web Spider to ignore /test/index.htm, and so
     on.

   - "Disallow: /" causes a Web Spider to ignore the whole site; sometimes this
     is desirable.

   - "Disallow: " allows a Web Spider to crawl the whole site.

3. Lines that begin with the pound symbol (#) denote comments, which can be
  useful when creating long sets of rules.

Examples

   - This example disallows all Web Spiders for the entire site:

  # Make changes for all web spiders
  User-agent: *
  Disallow: / 

   - The following example disallows a Robot named "WebSpider" from the virtual
     paths "/marketing" and "/sales":

  # Tell "WebSpider" where it can't go
  User-agent: WebSpider
  Disallow: /marketing
  Disallow: /sales

  # Allow all other robots to browse everywhere
  User-agent: *
  Disallow:

   - This example allows only a Web Spider named "SpiderOne" into a site, while
     denying all other Spiders:

  # Allow "SpiderOne" in the site
  User-agent: SpiderOne
  Disallow:

  # Deny all other spiders
  User-agent: *
  Disallow: / 

   - This last example disallows FrontPage-related paths in the root of your
     Web site:

  # Ignore FrontPage files
  User-agent: *
  Disallow: /_borders
  Disallow: /_derived
  Disallow: /_fpclass
  Disallow: /_overlay
  Disallow: /_private
  Disallow: /_themes
  Disallow: /_vti_bin
  Disallow: /_vti_cnf
  Disallow: /_vti_log
  Disallow: /_vti_map
  Disallow: /_vti_pvt
  Disallow: /_vti_txt
