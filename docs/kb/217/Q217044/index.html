When you use Systems Management Server 2.0 Setup to uninstall a site server, all
components are not removed.

The following registry entries remain on your site server:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SMSPerfCountersForC:_SMSLOGON_I386_SMSPERF.DLL

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SMSPerfCountersForC:_SMS_BIN_I386_SMSPERF.DLL

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \Software\Microsoft\SMS

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \Software\Microsoft\NAL

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \Software\Microsoft\WBEM

The following directories remain on the site server:

  Winnt\System32\Wbem

  SMSLogon

The following accounts remain in User Manager for Domains:

  SMSClient_&lt;sitecode&gt; (client network connection account)

  SMSCliToknAcct&amp; (System Management internal group account)

  SMSServer_&lt;sitecode&gt; (server network connection account)

  SMSService (System Management site server account)

NOTE: If you do not delete the accounts listed above from User Manager for
Domains, the site server might not become a Systems Management Server client
when you reinstall.
