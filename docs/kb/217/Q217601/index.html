-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you modify an object in the directory, the directory may indicate that the
object was modified at a different time. The time appears in Greenwich mean
time, rather than the time zone in which you are located.

For example, if you are located in the Pacific time zone and you modify an object
in the directory at 2:00 P.M., the directory incorrectly indicates that the
object was modified at 10:00 P.M. The eight-hour difference is the same as the
difference between the Pacific time zone and Greenwich mean time.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is known to occur when Microsoft Visual C++ version 6.0 is
installed on the Exchange Server computer. The problem may also occur with other
programs that install an updated version of the Msvcrt.dll file.


This problem occurs because later versions of the Msvcrt.dll file reset the time
zone information differently.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Directory

+--------------------------+
| File name   | Version    | 
+--------------------------+
| Dsamain.exe | 5.5.2504.0 | 
+--------------------------+

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.
This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3.
