SUMMARY
=======

This article provides a programmatic workaround for the problem described in the
following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q157174 Windows NT Logon Script Does Not Run on Windows 95 RAS Client

On Win9x, if a mobile user tries to log on to a domain when the mobile machine is
not connected, the user will receive the following error message:

  No Domain Server was available to validate your password. You may not be able
  to gain access to some network resources. OK, Cancel.

If the user clicks OK and then later uses RAS to dial in to a domain, the logon
script won't run because the machine assumes it has already logged on to the
domain. The workaround is to call the 16-bit LAN Man API NetWkstaSetUID2 to
programmatically log off the domain before using RAS to dial into the domain.

The 16-bit Microsoft LAN Manager Programmer's ToolKit version 2.1 is provided
with this Microsoft Knowledge Base article for your convenience. A Visual C
version 1.52 MS-DOS project demonstrating the NetWkstaSetUID2 API to log off a
domain is also provided.

To use the sample, run "netwks16 -d yourdomain -f 3" (without the quotation
marks) in an MS-DOS console window. This logs you off the domain.

NOTE: This method should be used only if you encounter the problem described in
the KB article above. Furthermore, Microsoft does not recommend programmatically
logging off or on to a domain, because it opens up possible security problems if
the program stores and/or retrieves the password.
