The following information is from "Section 1: Introduction" of the
Microsoft C version 5.10 MTDYNA.DOC file.

1.1   Threads

Three types of multitasking are present in OS/2: screen groups,
processes, and threads. A screen group, the highest-level multitasking
element, consists of one or more processes that share a logical screen
and keyboard. For example, a word processor and a database operating
simultaneously under OS/2 would represent two screen groups. A process
is the part of an executing program that is the unit of ownership for
resources such as memory, open files, and semaphores. Finally, a
thread is the execution path within a process, and it is the smallest
multitasking unit managed by OS/2. A process may consist of one or
more threads.

Two sample programs supplied with this release highlight the use of
threads. The first example program, mhello.c, is a multiple-thread
version of the classic "Hello world" program. The second example
program, snap.c, uses multiple threads to capture screen images to a
file.

A pictorial representation of screen groups, processes, and threads is
shown in Figure 1 below. Each screen group consists of two processes.
These processes are composed of several threads. In any process,
thread 1 is the main thread. All threads in a process are independent.
