The following information is from "Section 5: Creating Dynamic-Link
Libraries" of the Microsoft C version 5.10 MTDYNA.DOC file.

5.1.2   Creating a Single-Thread Dynamic-Link Library

The process of creating a single-thread dynamic-link library is
outlined below:

1. Create a definition file (.DEF extension) for the main program
   (STMAIN.DEF). This definition file specifies which functions it
   will import from the dynamic-link library. In this simple example,
   the file STMAIN.DEF contains the following:

      NAME STMAIN
      IMPORTS STDLL._DynalibTest

2. Create a definition file for the dynamic-link library (STDLL.DEF)
   that specifies which functions it will export. In this simple
   example, the file STDLL.DEF contains the following:

      LIBRARY STDLL
      DESCRIPTION 'Sample Dynamic-Link Library written in Microsoft C'
      PROTMODE
      EXPORTS _DynalibTest
      DATA MULTIPLE

3. Compile the main program. The program may be compiled using any
   memory model and any math package. Since the sample single-thread
   dynamic-link library (STDLL.C) uses far data, the sample main
   program (STMAIN.C) can be compiled as either compact or large
   memory model. For a compact memory model, the C compiler is invoked
   with something like this:

      cl /AC /G2 /c stmain.c

4. Link the main program to produce STMAIN.EXE. The following files
   are linked together:

      STMAIN.OBJ     Output from step 3
      DOSCALLS.LIB   OS/2 support library
      CLIBCEP.LIB    Any regular C run-time library (in this
                     case, compact memory model, emulator math
                     package)
      STMAIN.DEF     Main definition-module (single thread)
      STMAIN.EXE     Output from LINK (single thread)

   The linker is invoked with something like this:

      link stmain.obj/noi,,, clibcep.lib doscalls.lib/nod,stmain.def;

5. Compile the dynamic-link library module. The module should be
   compiled with the /ALfw option which specifies large-code pointer
   size, far-data pointer size and a segment setup of SS not equal to
   DS; DS fixed. Stack checking should also be turned off. The C
   compiler is invoked with something like this:

      cl /Alfw /G2 /Gs /c stdll.c

6. Link the dynamic-link library module to produce STDLL.DLL. The
   following files are linked together:

      STDLL.OBJ      Output from step 5
      DOSCALLS.LIB   OS/2 support library
      LLIBCDLL.LIB   Single-thread dynamic-link library C
                     run-time support library
      STDLL.DEF      Dynamic-link library definition-module
      STDLL.DLL      Output from LINK

   The linker is invoked with something like this:

      link stdll.obj,stdll.dll/noi,,llibcdll.lib doscalls.lib/nod,stdll.def;

7. Place the STDLL.DLL file (from step 6) in a directory on your
   LIBPATH so OS/2 is able to find it. Then run the program
   STMAIN.EXE. If the dynamic-link-library file is not in your
   LIBPATH, OS/2 is not be able to run STMAIN.EXE.

Note: The LIBPATH is set in your CONFIG.SYS or CONFIG.OS2 file,
depending on which version of OS/2 you are using. LIBPATH is not part
of your environment strings like the LIB, INCLUDE and PATH variables.
