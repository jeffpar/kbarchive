The L2002 linker error message is as follows:

   "fixup overflow near &lt;number&gt; in frame seg &lt;segname&gt; target seg
    &lt;segname&gt; target offset &lt;number&gt;."

One possible reason for this error is that an assembler program
contains an intersegment short jump or intersegment short call.

LINK.EXE can also give this error if one of your compiled BASIC object
modules is too large. The solution is to split the module into two or
more separately compiled modules. This information applies to
QuickBASIC Versions 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50 for MS-DOS, and to BASIC
Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS and OS/2.

During the normal execution of a program, instructions residing in the
current code segment are being executed in a sequential order. A
program flows sequentially from one instruction to the next by
incrementing the IP register as each instruction is executed.

However, it is possible to alter this normal program flow. One method
is to transfer control to instructions residing in a different
segment. Referred to as an intersegment jump or intersegment transfer,
it is accomplished by altering both IP and CS.

If the size of the jump is less than 64K, but still involves
transferring to a different segment, then this is called an
intersegment short jump.

This error is usually associated with assembly language routines. It
usually doesn't occur with QuickBASIC programs.
