SYMPTOMS
========

The online documentation for UDConfig (Udconfig.hlp) indicates that it is
possible to change a Windows NT Password when you using Host Account Manager
(UDConfig.exe). This is a documentation error.

Host Account Manager is a configuration tool that allows an administrator the
ability to add or update user account information into a Host Security Domain.
When configured, this information gets stored into the Host Account Cache
(HAC).

Host Account Manager may also be install on Windows 95/98 or Windows NT
Workstation clients, allowing an end-user to manipulate their own cached
entries.

Though this tool can add or update cached entries and determine whether a user ID
and password is mapped or replicated, it cannot change a password in the Windows
NT User database as indicated by the online documentation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.


MORE INFORMATION
================

When you open Host Account Manager, you are presented with the Windows NT Domain
and Host Security Domain dialog boxes. The Windows NT Domain dialog box includes
Password and Confirm Password fields. When a "new" password is entered into
these fields, one of the following scenarios occurs, depending on which action
is taken.

If you click the Apply button is selected:

- The new password is sent to the AS/400 User database (or host User database
  if third-party software is being used). If the host or AS/400 User database
  accepts the password syntax, it changes the password on that system. The
  password does not get updated in the Windows NT database.
- The Host Account Cache for this user is updated reflecting the new password
  change.

If you click the Update Cache button:

- Only the Host Account Cache is updated for this user.

Becuase Host Account Manager does not have the ability to change a password in
the Windows NT database, this must done through a supported method. The
following is a list of the methods that are supported:

- Windows NT Server by using User Manager for Domains.
- Windows NT Workstation by using the CTRL-ALT-DELETE key combination, and then
  selecting Change Password.
- Windows 95/98 by clicking the Passwords icon in Control Panel.
