  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

You may need to move the Microsoft Exchange Server Internet Mail Service flat
database folder to a drive other than the installation drive, because of an
increase in mail volume or additional requirements for logging and archiving. By
default, the Internet Mail Service flat database folder location is
C:\Exchsrvr\Imcdata.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Exchange Server version 5.5, you can move the Internet Mail Service files by
using the Performance Optimizer. If necessary, you can move the Internet Mail
Service files manually by using the following steps:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Stop the Exchange Server Internet Mail Service; at a command prompt, type
  "net stop msexchangeimc" (without the quotation marks), and then press the
  ENTER key.

2. Start the Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

3. Locate the RootDir value under the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIMC\Parameters

4. Change the value to the new location of the Exchsrvr\Imcdata folder, for
  example, F:\Exchsrvr\Imcdata.

5. Create the new Imcdata folder. For example, to create the folder in the
  example in step 4, at a command prompt, type "md f:\exchsrvr\imcdata"
  (without the quotation marks), and then press the ENTER key.

6. From the original Imcdata folder, copy the In, Out, and Pickup folders to the
  new folder location. This maintains any messages that may be in these
  queues.

  NOTE: Ensure that when you perform this step that you do not copy the
  Queue.dat file.

7. Restart the Internet Mail Service; at a command prompt, type "net start
  msexchangeimc" (without the quotation marks), and then press the ENTER key.
