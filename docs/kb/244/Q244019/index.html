The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to retrieve files in Visual SourceSafe that have been
deleted but not destroyed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you delete a file from a project in Visual SourceSafe, a dialog box appears
that gives you the option of either deleting the file or destroying it
permanently.

If you choose to merely delete the file, the file will be removed from the view
in the SourceSafe explorer, but the file and all of its history will still exist
in the SourceSafe database. This gives you the option of recovering the file at
a later time.

If you elect to destroy a file, the file will not only be removed from the
SourceSafe explorer view, but it will be gone from the SourceSafe database as
well. A file that has been destroyed cannot be recovered.

Steps to Retrieve Deleted (Not Destroyed) Files in the Visual SourceSafe Explorer
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. In the Visual SourceSafe Explorer, select the project folder that contained
  the deleted file.

2. Click Show Properties, and then select the Deleted Items tab.

3. Select the deleted files and click Recover.

To Retrieve Deleted (Not Destroyed) Files from the Command Line
---------------------------------------------------------------

- Use the SS RECOVER command on the parent project of the deleted file.

  For example, this command will recover files that were deleted from the
  $/MyProj project:

  "SS RECOVER $/MyProj/*.*" (without the quotation marks)
