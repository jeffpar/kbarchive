-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft ODBC for Oracle version 2.5, versions Build 2.573.2927, Build 2.573.3513, Build 2.573.3711, Build 2.573.4202, Build 2.573.4403, Build 2.573.5303, Build 2.573.6019 
- Microsoft Data Access Components versions 2.1, 2.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using the Microsoft ODBC Driver for Oracle, NUMERIC fields that have been
defined with a null or odd scale but are bound as a character ODBC datatype
(such as SQL_C_CHAR) are returned with a trailing zero appended to the decimal
portion of the number, so that the scale contains an even number of digits.

This can potentially cause problems in applications such as Microsoft Access,
which does not compare "1.123" and 1.1230" equally.

CAUSE
=====

Internal to Oracle, NUMERIC fields that have been defined with an odd scale are
actually stored in Oracle with a trailing zero as the least significant digit.
Changes in recent builds of the ODBC driver for Oracle permit these trailing
zeros to be returned to the calling application.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem has been resolved with the Microsoft Oracle ODBC driver that ships
with MDAC 2.6.

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Data Access Components service pack that contains this
fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

This problem was corrected in MDAC 2.6.

MORE INFORMATION
================


The hotfix version of the Microsoft Oracle ODBC driver (msorcl32.dll) has been
modified to include a new connection attribute that will strip trailing zeros
from NUMERIC fields being returned as SQL_C_CHAR. This connection attribute may
also be added as an additional parameter to an Oracle connection string.

To configure this new attribute once the hotfix has been installed, use the ODBC
Administrator to locate an existing datasource that uses the Microsoft ODBC for
Oracle driver, and double-click on the DSN to bring up the configuration
screen.

In the Oracle ODBC driver configuration screen, use the Options button to expand
the dialog box so that extended configuration attributes are displayed. At the
bottom of the dialog box will be a checkbox titled "Truncate insignificant
trailing zero when using null or odd scale."

Checking this box will cause a new parameter called "StripTrailingZero" to be
added to the datasource in the registry. This is a String value, and will be set
to "1" for TRUE, and "0" for FALSE.

"StripTrailingZero" can also be added directly to a connection string, for
example:

DSN=OracleServer;UID=scott;PWD=tiger;StripTrailingZero=1;

-or-

Driver=Microsoft ODBC for Oracle;Server=OracleServer;UID=scott;PWD=tiger;StripTrailingZero=1;

Manual Installation
-------------------

1. Close or stop any applications or services that are using Msorcl32.dll. This
  may include Internet Information Server (IIS), Microsoft Transaction Server
  (MTS), and any ODBC, ADO, or OLE DB applications.

2. Download the hotfix version of Msorcl32.dll into a temporary directory.

3. Locate and rename the current version of Msorcl32.dll, which is in the
  \Winnt\System32 folder for Windows NT computers, and in the \Windows\System
  folder for Windows 9x computers.

4. Copy the hotfix version of Msorcl32.dll into the same location, and then
  restart your services and applications.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

- Use the ODBC Administrator to configure an Oracle datasource so that the
  "Truncate insignificant trailing zero when using null or odd scale" checkbox
  is cleared (not set).

- Copy the following code into a console application (modifying your Oracle
  server, username and password as necessary), compile and run it.

- Notice that several values have extra zeros appended to them. In particular,
  all of the odd scale fields have extra zeros, even when this puts the number
  of decimal digits beyond the defined size. Additionally, the no-scale fields
  will have zeros appended to create an even number of decimal digits.

- Use the ODBC Administrator to modify the Oracle datasource so that the
  "Truncate insignificant trailing zero when using null or odd scale" checkbox
  is checked, and run the code again. Notice that all values appear as they
  should.
