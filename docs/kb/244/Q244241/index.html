  A new advertised program is available. Do you want to open the Advertised
  Programs Wizard now?

If the user is not logged on when the advertised program is sent, the message is
not displayed when the user subsequently logs on to the network. However, the
Advertised Programs Monitor icon is displayed in the system tray (the area on
the right side of the taskbar).

Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, use either of the following methods.

Using the Hotfix Installer
--------------------------

NOTE: This method works on Intel-based computers only.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a share on your network. Q244241.exe is
  an Systems Management Server (SMS) Installer file that updates specific files
  on your site server.

2. Log on to your site server using an account with administrative privileges.

3. On the site server, quit the SMS Administrator console.

4. Run Q244241.exe and follow the directions in the wizard. You can run the file
  in quiet mode by using the /s switch.

Manual Installation
-------------------

NOTE: You can use this method for both Intel-based and Alpha-based site servers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a local subfolder on your site server or
  to a share on your network.

2. Quit the Systems Management Server Administrator console and stop all Systems
  Management Server services.

3. Copy the following files from the hotfix I386 folder into the
  &lt;Drive&gt;:\Sms\Bin\I386 folder:

  Odpsys32.exe
  Odpusr32.exe

4. If Alpha-based support is enabled on the primary site, copy the following
  files from the hotfix Alpha folder into the &lt;Drive&gt;:\Sms\Bin\Alpha
  folder:

  Odpsys32.exe
  Odpusr32.exe

5. Copy the updated Swdist32.exe file from the appropriate &lt;Platform&gt;
  subfolder into the
  &lt;Drive&gt;:\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Swdist\&lt;Platform&gt; folder.

6. Copy the updated Compver.ini file into the
  &lt;Drive&gt;:\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Swdist folder.

7. Restart the SMS services.
