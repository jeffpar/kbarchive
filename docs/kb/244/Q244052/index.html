SUMMARY
=======

AFP (also known as Advanced Format Printing and Advanced Function Presentation)
is not supported by SNA Server. This form of the data stream, IPDS (Intelligent
Printer Data Stream), requires the installation of a third-party product in
addition to SNA Server.

The following links list some of the products from the online SNA Resource Guide
related to AFP:

The third-party products discussed in this article are manufactured by vendors
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
these products' performance or reliability.

MORE INFORMATION
================

AFP is a set of rules and conventions created by IBM. These rules and
conventions govern various data types, such as text, font, image, graphics, bar
codes color, multimedia, and so on. IBM developed specific document architecture
to accommodate these data types. MO:DCA-P (Mixed Object Document Content
Architecture-Presentation) is this specification. This architecture supports the
storage and interchange of such data types on such platforms as IBM Mainframes,
AS/400 systems, RISC System/6000 and OS/2 for printing to IBM impact, laser, PCL
supported and PostScript supported print devices and print queues.
