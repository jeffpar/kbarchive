  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When IBM Client Access software is used for logon validation on a computer that
is running Windows NT Workstation, the logon dialog box may take a long time to
appear, and the Domain list may not appear at all.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the Protected Storage service must start before
the Client Access services start. The behavior is intermittent because the
timing of services' starting on a Windows NT Workstation-based computer is
affected by several circumstances.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, contact IBM to obtain a fix.


WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this behavior, run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe) and add a value
to Services keys:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate and click the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Cwbnetnt

NOTE: The above registry key is one path; it has been wrapped for readability.

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

  Value name: DependOnService
  Data type: REG_MULTI_SZ
  Value data: ProtectedStorage

4. Add the same value to the following keys also:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Cwbrdr

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Cwbrxd

5. Quit Registry Editor.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior can occur on a network when IBM Client Access 3.2 or 4.4 is
installed on Windows NT Workstation-based computers to validate their logon
identification to IBM AS400 mainframe computers that may be running System
Management Server 2.0.
