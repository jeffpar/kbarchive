-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After the Mailbox Cleanup Agent (MBClean) utility finishes running, personal
distribution lists (created by using Outlook 2000 clients) are missing.

CAUSE
=====

The MBClean utility was not designed to recognize personal distribution lists as
special items.

RESOLUTION
==========

Install Exchange Server version 5.5 Service Pack 3 (SP3) and Mailbox Manager
(included with SP3). By using Mailbox Manager, you can specify the folders that
are not to be scanned. If the Contacts folder is not scanned, personal
distribution lists that are stored there are not deleted.

MORE INFORMATION
================

After you upgrade to Outlook 2000, clients can create personal distribution
lists in the Contacts folder on the server. This feature was not available
before Outlook 2000, and was not taken into account when the MBClean utility was
created. If the MBClean utility version 1.93 or earlier is run on a server that
contains these distribution lists, it removes them, based on the policies that
are in place for other mail messages. The MBClean utility version 1.93 or
earlier ignores other special items, such as Contacts, Calendar Events, and
Tasks, but does not ignore personal distribution lists.
