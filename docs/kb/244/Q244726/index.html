MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft has released an update file that corrects problems you may experience
when you install the U.S. version of any of the programs listed at the beginning
of this article.

NOTE: Do not use this patch on Encarta 2001 products. This patch is designed for
Encarta 2000 products only.

If you experience problems when you install your Encarta program, download and
run the Crow.exe update file, and then install the Encarta program.


The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  Crow.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/encarta2000ref/enc2k/1.0/WIN98/EN-US/crow.exe)

Release Date: Oct-29-1999

Microsoft scanned this file for viruses. Microsoft used the most current
virus-detection software that was available on the date that the file was
posted. The file is stored on secure servers that prevent any unauthorized
changes to the file.

After you download the file:

1. Copy the Crow.exe file to a blank, formatted floppy disk.

2. Quit all programs that are running on your computer.

3. Insert the Encarta Installation and Resources CD-ROM into the CD-ROM or
  DVD-ROM drive.

  If Setup does not start automatically, double-click the My Computer icon on
  the desktop, and then double-click &lt;drive&gt; where &lt;drive&gt; is the
  drive letter of the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive.

4. When Setup starts, insert the floppy disk into the floppy disk drive.

5. Click Start, and then click Run.

6. In the Open box, type "a:" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.

7. Double click the Crow.exe file.

8. Click OK.

9. When you receive the following message, click OK.

  This patch is provided by Microsoft Product Support Services and may not be
  distributed by non-Microsoft personnel.

10. Follow the instructions on the screen to install your Encarta program.

IMPORTANT: Do not install Microsoft Natural Language Search from the list of
components (Microsoft Encarta Reference Suite 2000 and Microsoft Encarta World
English Dictionary only).

If you install Natural Language Search, Microsoft Encarta World Atlas 2000,
Encarta World English Dictionary, and Microsoft Research Organizer may not be
installed.

If you want to install Natural Language Search, install the other components
included with Encarta Reference Suite 2000 first, and then install Natural
Language Search. To do this:

1. Insert the Encarta 2000 Installation and Resources CD-ROM into the CD-ROM or
  DVD-ROM drive.

  NOTE: You may need to run the Crow.exe file before you install Natural
  Language Search.

2. Click Encarta Extras.

3. Click Microsoft Natural Language.

4. Follow the instructions on the screen to install Natural Language Search.

Microsoft has determined that this issue was caused by faulty disks produced at a
third party manufacturing site. If you wish replacement disks, please contact
the Microsoft Order Desk at 800-360-7561.

If you are still unable to install your Encarta program, you may need to
troubleshoot your CD-ROM drive. For additional information about how to
