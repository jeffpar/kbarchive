SYMPTOMS
========

When you start a computer that is running Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0
Service Pack 3 and has an Intel EtherExpress Pro 100+ LAN Model # PILA8480
network interface card (NIC) installed, one or more services may not start
automatically, and Event Viewer may record the following event:

  Event ID 5719 netlogon
  No Windows NT Domain Controller is available for domain domain name.
  The following error occurred:
  There are currently no logon servers available to service the logon request.

When this occurs, Event Viewer may also record similar events at startup
involving, but not limited to, the following services:

- Domain Name Service (DNS)
- Remote Access Service (RAS)
- Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
- Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)

Though these services may not start automatically, the NIC may still initialize
properly, and you can manually start these services in Control Panel.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because the standard NIC driver and the Iaft.sys virtual
network driver for the Intel EtherExpress Pro 100+ LAN NIC do not load properly.

RESOLUTION
==========

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry.
Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you
understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information
about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following
article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this behavior, change the value data in the 'Group' value from
'NDIS' to 'PNPTDI' in the following registry keys:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\IAFT
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\IAFTPROTOCOL

NOTE: Intel Corporation supplied this workaround. Microsoft has not tested it and
therefore cannot guarantee its results.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Intel EtherExpress Pro 100+ LAN NIC, Model # PILA8480, is a fault-tolerant
NIC designed to run in conjunction with another Intel NIC of the same model. The
Iaft.sys driver affects the functionality of this NIC. To make this NIC work
properly, please contact the Intel Corporation to inquire about a Network Driver
Interface Specifications (NDIS) patch for this NIC.
