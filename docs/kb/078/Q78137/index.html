<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Article: Q78137
Product(s): Microsoft LAN Manager
Version(s): 
Operating System(s): 
Keyword(s): kbnetwork
Last Modified: 30-JUL-2001

SUMMARY
=======

This article applies to LAN Manager versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.1a, and 2.2 running
under OS/2 versions 1.2 and 1.3 or MS-DOS version 5.0.

SYMPTOMS
========

3Com ELNK16 adapters are not jumper-configurable. Instead, they contain an
EEPROM that stores configuration information. You set up the interrupt, I/O base
address, transceiver type, and so on by running the 3Com 3c507 Setup program.
Because the card doesn't contain jumpers to set the I/O base, the ELNK16 uses
I/O base 100 as a reference point during start-up and diagnostics. Once the
driver is activated (at binding), it uses the configuration settings stored in
the EEPROM.

When the computer starts up, both ELNK16 cards use I/O base 100 as a reference
point. Because the ELNK16 is ROM configurable, there is no way for the driver to
know which adapter is being bound. Thus, the following messages may appear upon
rebooting (an OS/2 machine):

  HPFS File system driver is installed MS OS/2 Lan Manager Protocol V1.1 3Com
  OS/2 Network Driver for the Etherlink16 (3C507) V1.1 3Com OS/2 Network Driver
  for the Etherlink16 (3C507) V1.1 Microsoft OS/2 NetBEUI 2.0 Installing
  NETWKSTA.SYS Ver2.0.292 (May 25, 1991)

  PRO003: INTERRUPT CONFLICT in binding NETBEUI to ELNK16_NIF2 SYS1719: The file
  "C:\LANMAN\NETPROG\NETWKSTA.SYS" specified in the IFS command on line 46 of
  the CONFIG.SYS file does not contain a valid device driver or file system
  driver.

CAUSE
=====

Normally, jumpers and the IOADDRESS= parameter in PROTOCOL.INI differentiate
adapters from one another so the drivers know where to look for the board. In
the case of the ELNK16 adapters, the IOBASE= parameter must be put under the
DRIVERNAME=ELNK16$ (and ELNK16x$) in PROTOCOL.INI so the driver can find the
appropriate address to bind. Leaving out this parameter generates the above
interrupt conflict message, even though there may appear to be no conflict with
the interrupt.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Listed below is a sample configuration, tested on a Compaq 386/33 with LAN
Manager 2.0c and OS/2 1.3, running NETBEUI protocol:

          IOBASE = 0x320

LANMAN.INI
----------

  In [NETWORKS] section:
     net1 = netbeui$,0
     net2 = netbeui$,1

  In [WORKSTATION] section:
     wrknets = net1,net2

  In [SERVER] section:
     srvnets = net1,net2

Notes
-----

1. Any ISA adapter that uses an EEPROM to store settings will operate in a
  similar manner.

2. NetBEUI is not a routable protocol. As a result, nodes attached to the two
  network segments connected to the server can communicate with the server, but
  cannot exchange information between themselves.
