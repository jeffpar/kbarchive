The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

According to Security Microsystems Consultants, upgrading to MS-DOS version 5.0
or later with LOCKIT Utility version 1.5 installed may cause the MS-DOS Setup
program to default to the "Welcome to SETUP" message screen that prompts for the
setup to floppy disks routine.

CAUSE
=====

The LOCKIT Utility is a password protection product of Security Microsystems
Consultants.

During installation the LOCKIT Utility, the partition table and boot sector of
the hard disk are modified, and the following line is added to the CONFIG.SYS
file:

  " device=cleandsk.drv " (without the quotation marks)

As a result, SETUP is unable to recognize the hard disk and defaults to the setup
to floppy disks routine.

WORKAROUND
==========

LOCKIT Utility version 1.5 must be deleted before you upgrade to MS-DOS 5.0 or
later, and LOCKIT version 2.1 or later should be installed after the upgrade.

Security Microsystems Consultants recommends the following steps when upgrading
to MS-DOS with LOCKIT Utility version 1.5:

1. Uninstall LOCKIT Utility version 1.5 by following guidelines outlined in
  LOCKIT documentation. (Do NOT disable the DEVICE=CLEANDSK.DRV line in the
  CONFIG.SYS file or rename the CONFIG.SYS to disable this utility. The hard
  disk is completely inaccessible without the DEVICE=CLEANDSK.DRV driver
  enabled.)

2. Install the MS-DOS Upgrade.

3. Re-install LOCKIT Utility version 2.1 or later to use with MS-DOS version 5.0
  or later, or upgrade to version 3.0 for use with Windows 3.0 or 3.1.
