-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft MS-DOS operating system versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0, 6.2, 6.21, 6.22 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When upgrading some MS-DOS versions (primarily original equipment manufacturer
[OEM] versions) to MS-DOS 5.0, 6.0, or 6.2 the time and date are no longer
maintained when the computer is rebooted.

CAUSE
=====

The CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) chip was introduced as a
standard for storing hardware information (including time and date) with
AT-class machines. When XT machines were introduced, there was no standard for
saving/accessing the date and time information. Computer manufacturers (OEMs)
often added hardware to store and maintain the date and time settings. To then
access this hardware, those OEMs had to modify MS-DOS. Thus, when the upgrade to
MS-DOS 5.0, 6.0, or 6.2 is made, the modifications are overwritten and the time
and date are no longer accessible.

WORKAROUND
==========

Some OEMs have developed device drivers and hardware for their machines that
allow the time and date to function properly, but others do not support time and
date in MS-DOS 5.0, 6.0 and 6.2.

The following is a list of computers that have been found to lose the date and/or
time when booting with MS-DOS 5.0, 6.0, and 6.2. The Workaround column lists
device drivers/cards that may be used to work around this limitation.
