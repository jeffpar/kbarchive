-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition for Windows, version 2.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 2.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition for Windows, version 1.0 
- Microsoft Windows 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Windows version 3.0, the mouse behaves unexpectedly in both Visual Basic
version 1.0 and 2.0 under the following conditions:

- A Visual Basic program is run from the environment (VB.EXE) or from an
  executable using the run-time module.

- The program has a form that contains menus.

- While holding a menu open with the left button, if you click the right mouse
  button, the mouse selection appears to be inactivated.

- Moving up or down the menu while holding the left button down, causes no
  selection until you get several inches below the pop-up (or pull-down) menu.
  At that point, the mouse causes selection again from the remote position.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article when used with Microsoft Windows version 3.0. This bug
was corrected in Microsoft Windows version 3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem occurs when running a Visual Basic program that has menus. It
requires a mouse with two buttons and has been reported with both the Microsoft
and the Logitech mouse.

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

1. Run the Cardfile program that comes with Visual Basic. You'll find it in the
  Samples subdirectory.

2. Put the mouse cursor on one of the menu labels and press the left mouse
  button to activate it.

3. While continuing to hold down the left button, move the cursor to a menu item
  within the pop-up menu to highlight the menu item.

4. While holding the left button down, click the right button once. The menu
  item should no longer be highlighted.

5. Move the mouse from the item you were selecting. Observe that the mouse no
  longer activates submenus, and the menu does not retract.

6. Continue to move the mouse down from the menu. At some point, the
  highlighting of the submenu items will be activated again.

7. Upon stopping on a submenu item and releasing the left button, that menu
  command will execute.

NOTE: This behavior also occurs if you open a menu and, while holding down the
left button, you use the right button to click the screen.
