-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

During the installation or re-installation of Internet Information Services
(IIS) 5.0, you may receive the following error message:

  "Error Writing Encrypted Data to the Web Services Configuration Database."

The installation halts, and you are prompted to Retry, Write unencrypted, or
Write unencrypted all.

CAUSE
=====

This error occurs because of incorrect (corrupt) information. If this is a new
installation of IIS 5.0, the corrupt information is located in the following
folder:

  %Windir%\Documents and Settings\

If you are re-installing IIS, the corrupt information is located in the following
folder:

  %Windir%\Profiles\All Users\Application Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, follow these steps:

1. If you are still prompted to retry, delete all keys except the key that
  corresponds to the start of the latest installation from the MachineKeys
  folder. This key has a date/time stamp that corresponds to the time that you
  started your last installation.

  -or-

  If the installation is cancelled or did not complete successfully, use Windows
  Explorer to remove encryption from the %Windir%\Profiles\All
  Users\Application Data\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\MachineKeys folder. To this,
  follow these steps:

  a. Right-click the folder, and then click Properties.

  b. On the General tab, click Advanced.

  c. Clear the "Encrypt contents to secure data" check box, and then click OK.
     If this check box is NOT already selected, rename the MachineKeys folder
     to "OldMachineKeys".

2. Log off, and then log back on as Local Administrator. The installation or
  reinstallation of IIS 5.0 should complete successfully.
