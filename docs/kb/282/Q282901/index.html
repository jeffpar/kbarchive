If you insert an ATA PC Card before turning on a computer that already has a
SCSI PC Card present, the following problems may occur:

- No drive letter is assigned to some of the SCSI devices (such as a CD-ROM
  drive).

- A "ghost" drive appears (there are no folders or files, and you cannot write
  to the drive).
