-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you open a project and do anything that uses IntelliSense, you receive a
"permission denied" error message when you try to recompile the project. The
project defines a public User Defined Type (UDT) that it uses as a parameter to
a public function, and binary compatibility is set.

RESOLUTION
==========

Save the changes, and close your project. Then, reopen your project and compile
it.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Note that there are other situations where you expect to receive a "permission
denied" error message. For example, if you run another application to test your
.dll, you are not able to recompile your .dll until the other application is
closed and the .dll is released.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. In Visual Basic, create a new ActiveX DLL project. Class1 is created by
  default.

2. Add the following code to Class1:

  Public Type MyType
     type1 as integer
     type2 as integer
  End Type

  Public Function F1 (t as MyType)
  End Function

3. On the File menu, save the project.

4. On the File menu, select Make to compile the project.

5. On the Project menu, select Properties, select the Component tab, and then
  set the Binary Compatibility to the compiled .dll.

6. Close Visual Basic.

7. Reopen Visual Basic, and reload the .dll project you just created.

8. Drop down the list in the upper-left of the Class1 code window where it says
  "(General)," and select Class. This puts your cursor in the Class_Initialize
  procedure. Type "Err." (without the quotation marks) to see the IntelliSense.
  You can now press the BACKSPACE key to delete Err.. (You just want to view
  the IntelliSense, not add a line of code to the project.)

9. Try to recompile the project, and note that you receive the "permission
  denied" error message.

10. Save the project, and then close Visual Basic.

11. Reopen Visual Basic, reload the project, and note that you are able to
  recompile it.

NOTE: Instead of closing Visual Basic in the preceding steps, you can also start
a new Standard EXE (or any other project type), and then reload the ActiveX DLL
project.
