-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Contrary to what is stated in the "Microsoft FORTRAN Getting Started" booklet
included with Microsoft FORTRAN version 5.0 and the "Microsoft FORTRAN
Installing and Using the Professional Development System" booklet shipped with
Microsoft FORTRAN version 5.1, SET statements for environment variables should
not be included in the STARTUP.CMD file. These statements should be included in
the CONFIG.SYS file, an OS2INIT.CMD file, or in another .CMD file that is
executed before FORTRAN is used.

The FORTRAN version 4.10 manuals do not contain this documentation error, but the
information included below about setting up the environment also applies to
version 4.10.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 20 of the "Microsoft FORTRAN Getting Started" booklet included with FORTRAN
5.0 states the following:

  The environment-setting commands can be included in your AUTOEXEC.BAT or
  STARTUP.CMD file to ensure that the compiler environment is properly set up
  each time you reboot.

Page 21 of the "Microsoft FORTRAN Installing and Using the Professional
Development System" booklet included with FORTRAN version 5.1 states the
following:

  If the host operating mode is OS/2, add the contents of the NEW-VARS.CMD file
  to your STARTUP.CMD file and the contents of NEW-CONF.SYS to CONFIG.SYS.

This is correct for the MS-DOS AUTOEXEC.BAT file but not for the OS/2 STARTUP.CMD
file. Both files are executed when a machine running their respective systems is
booted, but the environment variables set in STARTUP.CMD are only recognized by
the OS/2 screen group that executes the .CMD file. If another OS/2 screen group
is started, STARTUP.CMD is not automatically executed and the environment set by
it in the original screen group does not affect the new screen group.

To ensure that the environment settings required by FORTRAN are set under OS/2,
the PATH, SET LIB, SET TMP, SET INIT, and SET INCLUDE statements should be
included in the CONFIG.SYS file, in an OS2INIT.CMD file, or in a .CMD file that
is executed before working with FORTRAN.

Environment variables can be set in the CONFIG.SYS file for OS/2 versions 1.1 and
later. The variables set there are recognized by each OS/2 screen group. This
feature is not available in version 1.00 of OS/2. In this case, an OS2INIT.CMD
file can be used to set the environment.

The OS2INIT.CMD file is the OS/2 equivalent to the MS-DOS AUTOEXEC.BAT in terms
of setting the environment for an OS/2 screen group. To use OS2INIT.CMD, the /K
option for CMD.EXE must be included in the PROTSHELL statement of CONFIG.SYS.

For example:

     PROTSHELL=... ... C:\0S2\CMD.EXE /K OS2INIT.CMD

The file specified after the /K option is executed every time a new screen group
is started. Any name can be used for the .CMD file.
