SUMMARY
=======

BUG: 8029

SYMPTOMS
========

When an ADMIN account is downgraded (under NIF) to a USER or GUEST account, NIF
detects the change correctly (the user no longer has the access permissions he
or she had while his or her account was an ADMIN account). However, the menus
still allow the user to access most of the screen groups he or she could access
before. NIF should update the menus to reflect the change in the user's
privileges.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in OS/2 LAN Manager versions 2.x.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.

Additional query words: 2.00 2.10 2.10a 2.20 keep net
