SYMPTOMS
========

  When attempting to start OS/2 or MS-DOS LAN Manager version 2.x for the first
  time on a Gateway 2000 (25-MHz 386, 8 MB) computer with a 3Com 3C603 Token
  Link card, NET STARTing the server causes the OS/2 system to hang. At this
  point, only a power shutdown can revive the system.

CAUSE
=====

  By default, a Gateway 2000 computer has a bus speed of 12 MHz, which must be
  changed to 8 MHz by setting the appropriate jumpers on the motherboard. Once
  the bus speed has been set to a lower value (8 MHz), the 3C603 Token Link
  card will work correctly, and so will OS/2 or DOS LAN Manager.

  The reason the bus speed must be changed is that all ISA net cards are
  designed to run with a bus clock of 6 to 8.333 MHz. Therefore, a higher (or
  different) bus clock frequency will affect all ISA devices in an unspecified
  manner.

  EISA devices (net cards) are designed to handle higher bus clock frequencies
  (up to 33 MHz).
