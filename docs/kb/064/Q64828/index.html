The following list outlines reasons why the sample programs included
with many Microsoft language products might produce warnings when
compiled:

1. Many of the language elements (for instance, typecasts), which
   might be necessary to eliminate the warnings, could obscure the
   points the writer is trying to emphasize.

   The sample programs are included to explain a topic or demonstrate
   how to use a feature, and might not necessarily reflect model
   programming practice.

2. The documents are written well before the compiler is finished in
   the development process. The warnings sometimes change as the
   compiler progresses. Therefore, it is very difficult to write
   warning-free code early in the development process and have it
   compile with no warnings with the release version.
