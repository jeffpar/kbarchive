SYMPTOMS
========

After a power failure occurs on an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) protected
server, this message appears at the workstation:

  A power failure has occurred at \\SERVER1. Please terminate all activity with
  this server.

Attempting to save open files fails and an error message appears, indicating that
the path is no longer available.

CAUSE
=====

The power failure message is sent to all session connected workstations,
MESSDELAY seconds after power is lost. Then, unless the UPS has the capability
to inform the server of a low-power state (see note below), the UPS server stops
the SERVER service BATTERYTIME seconds after the point of initial power loss.

MESSDELAY defaults to 5 seconds and BATTERYTIME defaults to 60 seconds. Thus, by
default, all files must be closed within 55 seconds of receiving the warning
message. If the files are not closed within (BATTERYTIME minus MESSDELAY)
seconds from the initial power failure warning, you then cannot close the files
because the server service has stopped.

RESOLUTION
==========

When the server service is properly stopped, as it is when it is stopped by the
UPS service, all open files are safely closed in the state they were in when
they were last saved.

Using a NET USE command at the workstation shows that connections to the stopped
server are in a "disconnected" state. After power returns and the server service
is restarted, workstation application files can be closed safely.

EXAMPLE
=======

1. At a network workstation, a Microsoft Word document is opened from a remote
  share-point linked to drive F.

2. Power is lost at the server. All open files are closed and the server service
  is stopped before the user has a chance to save the Word document.

3. The user tries to save the Word document and receives a "disk error" message
  notification. Drive F is now in a "disconnected" state.

4. Power is restored to the server and the server service is restarted; shares
  are re-established.

5. The user tries again to save the Word document (as described in step 3
  above). Drive F is automatically reconnected and the Word document is saved
  successfully.

Note: If the UPS has the capability to inform the UPS service of a "low battery"
state, and the SIGNALS' second digit is accordingly set to 1, the UPS service
ignores BATTERYTIME and does not initiate server shutdown until it receives the
low-power signal from the UPS.
