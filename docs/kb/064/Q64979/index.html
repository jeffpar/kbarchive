The following article gives a benchmark comparison of ISAM file speed
in Microsoft BASIC Professional Development System (PDS) version 7.10
versus the following products: BASIC PDS version 7.00, Fox Software's
FoxPro version 1.0, and Novell's Btrieve version 5.0c.

These performance comparisons are taken from the Microsoft press
release document (for BASIC PDS 7.10) dated July 24, 1990.

ISAM DATABASE SPEED COMPARISONS
-------------------------------

The benchmark suites used by Microsoft for performance testing and
comparison are similar to those used by Software Digest at National
Software Testing Laboratories (NSTL) for benchmarking of relational
databases. All benchmark tests below were performed on a COMPAQ 386
20e with a 110 MB hard disk and 640K of conventional memory under
MS-DOS.

The following four files ("tables" in BASIC PDS) were used: two files
(tables) with three indexed columns and 1000 records; one file (table)
with three indexed columns and 10000 records; and one file (table)
with two indexed columns and 10000 records. Each record (in each
file/table) contained 10 text columns plus one integer column, for a
total of 122 characters per record. The total database size for the
four files (tables) was 6 megabytes in both BASIC PDS and Novell
Btrieve. A disk unfragmentation utility was run to compact the
databases before performing the benchmarks.

BASIC PDS 7.10 Versus 7.00
--------------------------

All tests ran using 64K of ISAM buffer space.

--------------------------------------------------------------

These tests ran using maximum buffer space available in 640K
conventional memory.
