SYMPTOMS
========

When a user connects to an IIS site that uses SSL, the browser may encounter a
problem. Specifically, Internet Explorer may generate an error message (usually
a Dr. Watson in Windows NT or a General Protection Fault in Windows 95/98) for
the Schannel.dll file.

Note: Netscape Navigator does not use the standard Windows Schannel.dll file.
When you are connecting with Netscape, you are notified that an error occurred
in the secure communication.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can be caused when the server certificate (intermediate, non-root
certificate) installed on IIS has the same Subject and Issuer. For example, if
the certificate's Issued to: and Issued by: fields both contain "Microsoft."

When Schannel processes the request, it sees this certificate as being
self-signed (in other words, a root Certificate Authority certificate). Schannel
does not allow these to be sent out, and therefore sends the client no server
key. The client, not expecting this, does not know how to process this error.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem in the Schannel.dll file has been corrected in Internet Information
Services 5.0 for Windows 2000.

Note: The server certificate must be deleted and re-installed.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, delete the server certificate, and then create a
new server certificate with a different Subject and Issuer. You can delete the
existing certificate, by doing the following:

1. Start Internet Explorer on the IIS computer.

2. From the Internet Options menu, click the Content tab.

3. In the Intermediate Certification Authorities list, remove the server
  certificate.
