The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft ODBC for Oracle version 2.0 Build 2.73.7269 
- Microsoft ODBC Driver for Oracle (Build 2.06325), version 1.0 
- Microsoft ODBC for Oracle version 2.5, versions Build 2.573.2927, Build 2.573.4403, Build 2.573.6526, Build 2.573.7713.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade from Microsoft Oracle Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) driver
version 1.0 (Build 2.00.6325) to a newer Oracle ODBC driver (for example,
2.573.2927 or 2.573.4303), the transaction commit and rollback behaviors change,
and the following error message may occur in the code that was previously
working:

  Run-time error 3146: ODBC-Call Failed

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur because in Oracle ODBC driver version 1.0 (Build
2.00.6325), the cursors are preserved in the same position as before the COMMIT
or ROLLBACK operation.

This behavior is by design.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this behavior, programs have to take into account that the cursor
commit behavior is changed. If either a COMMIT or ROLLBACK operation is
implemented, then the resultset must be recreated. The Oracle ODBC driver does
not support preserving with a cursor after a COMMIT or ROLLBACK operation.

STATUS
======


MORE INFORMATION
================

To determine how a cursor is treated after a COMMIT or ROLLBACK operation, use
the ODBC application programming interface (API) SQLGetInfo with the
SQL_CURSOR_COMMIT_BEHAVIOR or SQL_CURSOR_ROLLBACK_BEHAVIOR options.

For the Oracle ODBC driver, the result of this call is changed from
SQL_CB_PRESERVE to SQL_CB_CLOSE. This means that when a COMMIT occurs for a
transaction, active cursors close if they are a part of the transaction. For
prepared statements, the application can call SQLExecute on the statement
without calling SQLPrepare again. When you commit a transaction the cursor is
closed, but the "access plans" on prepared statements are retained.

Oracle ODBC driver version 1.0 has the following capabilities:

  SQLGetInfo:
  InfoType = SQL_TXN_CAPABLE=46
  Out: *InfoValuePtr = SQL_TC_DML = 1

SQL_TC_DML means that transactions can only contain Data Manipulation Language
(DML) statements (SELECT, INSERT, etc). Data Definition Language (DDL)
statements encountered in a transaction can cause an error.

  SQLGetInfo:
  InfoType = SQL_CURSOR_COMMIT_BEHAVIOR=23
  Out: *InfoValuePtr = SQL_CB_PRESERVE = 2

  SQLGetInfo:
  InfoType = SQL_CURSOR_ROLLBACK_BEHAVIOR=24
  Out: *InfoValuePtr = SQL_CB_PRESERVE = 2

SQL_CB_PRESERVE means the Oracle ODBC driver can preserve cursors in the same
position as before the COMMIT or ROLLBACK operation. The application can
continue to fetch data or it can close the cursor and re-execute the statement
without repreparing it.

Oracle ODBC driver version 2.0 and higher drivers return the following:

  SQLGetInfo:
  InfoType = SQL_TXN_CAPABLE=46,
  Out: *InfoValuePtr = SQL_TC_DDL_COMMIT = 3

This means that transactions can only contain DML statements. DDL statements (for
example, Create TABLE) that are encountered in a transaction cause the
transaction to be committed.

  SQLGetInfo:
  InfoType = SQL_CURSOR_COMMIT_BEHAVIOR=23
  Out: *InfoValuePtr = SQL_CB_CLOSE = 1

This means Close cursors on commit. For prepared statements, the application can
call SQLExecute on the statement without calling SQLPrepare again. So when you
commit a transaction, the cursor is closed, but the "access plans" on prepared
statements are retained.

  SQLGetInfo:
  InfoType = SQL_CURSOR_ROLLBACK_BEHAVIOR=24,
  Out: *InfoValuePtr = SQL_CB_CLOSE = 1

This means Close cursors on rollback. For prepared statements, the application
can call SQLExecute on the statement without calling SQLPrepare again. So when
you rollback a transaction, the cursor is closed, but the "access plans" on
prepared statements are retained.
