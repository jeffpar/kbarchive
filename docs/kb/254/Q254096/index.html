development tools provided for Windows NT 3.51 x86-based and Windows NT 4.0 x86-
and Alpha-based computers; including all service pack revisions. These tools are
available in English language only. These tools extend the functionality of
existing debugging tools such as a kernel debugger, provide new features upon
which new debugging methodologies can be based, and provide development support.
This article provides information about these tools, and how to install them.

IMPORTANT: OEM Support Tools Phase 3 Service Release 0 is also available and
replaces OEM Support Tools Phase 2 Service Release 2. Phase 3 SR0 supports
Windows NT 4.0 (x86 only) and Windows 2000. For additional information, click

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following four tools/set of tools are available in OEM Support Tools Phase 2
Service Release 2:

Kernel Debugger Extensions
--------------------------

New debugger extensions to facilitate examination and analysis of a wider range
of kernel data structures than is conveniently possible today, especially when
dealing with crash dumps.

Pool Enhancements
-----------------

Tools for memory pool caller-tracking/tail-checking, pool logging, pool free
block pattern fill, and increasing available pool statistics.

Kernel Memory Space Analyzer
----------------------------

A heuristics-based kernel memory crash dump analysis tool to aid in diagnosing
memory corruption problems. This tool discovers and analyzes anomalies in the
kernel memory space.

User Mode Process Dump
----------------------

A tool that allows users to create dump files from any Win32 process, such as
Csrss.exe or Explorer.exe, that can be examined using Windows Debugger. The tool
