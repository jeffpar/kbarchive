How to Eliminate Document-Specific Printing Problems
----------------------------------------------------

Printing problems in Microsoft Word can be specific to particular documents and
templates. You may have one or more documents that may not be printed or that
give you some sort of error message. To resolve problems similar to this, try
the following:

Step 1: Can You Print Other Word Documents?:

If you are having problems printing a particular document, close the problem
document and try to print a different document.

If you cannot print other documents, create a new document and try to print it by
using the following steps:

a. Close all open Word documents.

b. On the File menu, click New.

c. On the General tab, click Blank Document, and then click OK.

d. In your new blank Word document, type some text.

e. On the Print menu, click Print.

f. In the Print dialog box, click OK.

If you can print this new document, you have identified that the problem is
specific to particular Word documents. Proceed to Step 3 to resolve the problem
with these documents.

If you cannot print this new document, proceed to step 2.

Step 2: Rename Normal.dot:

If you cannot print the new Word document that you created in step 1, rename the
Word global template (Normal.dot). To do this, follow these steps:

a. Quit Microsoft Word.

b. On the Windows Start menu, point to Find, and then click Files or Folders.

c. In the Named box of the Name &amp; Location tab, type "Normal.dot" (without
  the quotation marks). Change the Look in box to your C: drive or Local hard
  drives (C:,D:) if you have multiple hard disks. Make sure the Include
  subfolders check box is selected, and then click Find Now.

d. For each occurrence of the Normal.dot file that is found, rename it to
  Normal.old. To do this, follow these steps:

  1. Click Normal.

  2. On the File menu, click Rename.

  3. Type "Normal.old" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER.

If Find Now finds other Normal.dot files, rename each one to Normal.old.

e. Restart Microsoft Word. Word automatically creates a new Normal.dot file.

f. In the new blank Word document, type some text.

g. On the File menu, click Print.

h. In the Print dialog box, click OK.

If you can print the new Word document, you have determined that the problem is a
corrupted Normal.dot file. You can now print new documents that are created from
the new global (Blank Document) template (Normal.dot).

If you cannot print this new document, there may be a problem that prevents
Microsoft Word from printing. If this is the case, proceed to the "What Are Some
Other Things I Can Try?" section of this article for additional steps to help
resolve this problem.

However, you may still be unable to print existing documents that were created by
using your old corrupted Normal.dot file. If this is the case, proceed to step 4
to resolve problems with these documents.


Step 3: Create a New Custom Template:

You may still not be able to print particular Word documents. Examine the problem
documents to determine whether they were created from the same custom template.

To determine which template the problem document was created from, follow these
steps:

a. Open a document that you cannot print.

b. On the Tools menu, click Templates and Add-ins.

c. The template that the document was created from should be listed in the
  Document template box.

If the template listed is Normal.dot, proceed to step 4 to resolve the problem
with this document.

If the template listed is a different template, create a new custom template. To
do this, follow these steps:

1. On the File menu, click New.

2. On the General tab, click Blank Document, and then click OK.

3. In the blank new Word document, type and create your template as you want it
  to appear.

4. On the File menu, click Save As.

5. In the Save As dialog box, type a new file name for your new custom template,
  change the Save as type box to Document Template, and then click Save.

6. On the File menu, click Close to close your new custom template.

7. On the File menu, click New.

8. Click the new template that you created, and then click OK.

9. Type any additional text that you want, and then click Print on the File
  menu.

10. In the Print dialog box, click OK.

If the document that was created from your new custom template is printed
correctly, you have determined that the major problem is with a corrupted custom
template, and you need to create a new custom template for new documents.

However, you still may not be able to print the documents that were created from
your corrupted custom template. If this is the case, proceed to step 4 to
resolve problems with these documents.

Step 4: The Problem Document:

You have reached this step because you have determined that you cannot print the
document because it is damaged in some way.

To print your document, try one or more of the following:

- Try printing a range of pages. To do this, follow these steps:

  a. On the File menu, click Print.

  b. In the Print dialog box, click Pages, and then type a range of pages that
     you want to print. For example, type "1-1" (without the quotation marks).
     This prints the first page of your document.

  c. If this page is printed correctly, repeat the process, and specify the
     next range of pages as needed to print your entire document.

  -or-

- Save your problem document as Rich Text Format. To do this, follow these
  steps:

  a. On the File menu, click Save As.

  b. In the Save As dialog box, type a new file name for your document in the
     File name box.

  c. Change the Save as type box to Rich Text Format.

  d. Click Save. Your new document is saved with the RTF extension.

  e. On the File menu, click Close to close the new RTF document.

  f. On the File menu, click Open, and then open the new RTF document that you
     just saved.

  g. On the File menu, click Save As.

  h. In the Save As dialog box, change the Save as type box to Word Document,
     and then click Save.

     NOTE: You do not need to type a new file name in the File name box, because
     you renamed your new document in step b.

  i. On the File menu, click Close to close your new Word document.

  j. On the File menu, click Open, and then open the new Word document that you
     just saved.

  k. On the File menu, click Print.

  l. In the Print dialog box, click OK.

  If you can print your new document, you have resolved the problem with your
  damaged document. Delete the old Word document that was causing your printing
  problems, and work with your new Word document.

  -or-

- Copy and paste your entire Word document into a new Word file. To do this,
  follow these steps:

  a. Press CTRL+END to go to the end of your Word document.

  b. Press CTRL+SHIFT+HOME to select the entire document and go to the top of
     your Word document.

  c. On the Edit menu, click Copy.

  d. On the File menu, click New.

  e. On the General tab, click Blank Document, and then click OK.

  f. In the new blank Word document, click Paste on the Edit menu.

  g. On the File menu, click Print.

  h. In the Print dialog box, click OK.

  If you can print your new Word document, you have resolved the problem. Your
  old Word document is damaged. Save your new Word document and work with it.
  Then you can delete the damaged document.

  -or-

- Copy and paste sections of your Word document to a new file. To do this,
  follow these steps:

  a. Select a portion of your Word document. If your document contains
     sections, do not select a section break.

  b. On the Edit menu, click Copy.

  c. On the File menu, click New.

  d. On the General tab, click Blank Document, and then click OK.

  e. In the new blank Word document, click Paste.

  f. On the File menu, click Print.

  g. In the Print dialog box, click OK.

  If you can print your new Word document, you have determined that your
  existing Word document is damaged. Repeat these steps with the next portions
  of your damaged document, and copy them into your new Word document. You may
  want to copy a portion at a time and print your new Word document after you
  paste each portion. This ensures that you are not copying a damaged portion
  to your new Word file.

  IMPORTANT: Do not copy and paste any section breaks into your new Word
  document, because this may copy the problem into your new Word document.

  After you copy all the portions of the damaged document to your new Word
  document, save it as a Word document with a new file name. After you print
  your new Word document, you may want to delete the damaged Word document.

If these steps still have not allowed you to print your Word documents, proceed
to the "What Are Some Other Things I Can Try?" section of this article.

What Are Some Other Things I Can Try?
-------------------------------------

You have reached this section because you cannot print any document from
Microsoft Word. Try the following items to correct this problem.

Damaged Printer Driver:

Printing problems in Microsoft Word can be caused by a damaged printer driver. If
this is the case, delete and reinstall your printer driver. To do this, follow
these steps:

1. Quit all Windows applications.

2. On the Windows Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Printers.

3. Right-click your installed default printer, and click Delete from the
  shortcut menu that appears.

4. Click Yes to the following message

  Are you sure you want to delete the printer 'printername'?

  where 'printername' is the name of your installed default printer.

5. You may receive an additional message when you delete your printer driver.
  Click Yes to the following message:

  Some files were used only for this printer and are no longer needed. Would
  you like to delete these files now?

6. After Windows removes your installed default printer and its associated
  files, re-install the printer. To do this, do one of the following:

   - In the Printers dialog box (on the Windows Start menu, point to Settings,
     and then click Printers), double-click Add Printer, and then follow the
     Add Printer Wizard to reinstall your Windows printer driver.

     -or-

   - Use the disk that was provided by your printer manufacturer, and install
     it according to the installation instructions. For more information about
     how to install the printer driver that was provided with your printer,
     please contact your printer manufacturer.

  Q60782 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, Q-Z

After you reinstall your printer driver, restart Windows. Start Microsoft Word,
and try to print your Word document. If you can print your Word document, you
have resolved the problem. If you continue to have problems when you try to
print from Microsoft Word, try other suggestions listed in this article.

Damaged Word Data Key:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Printing problems in Microsoft Word can be caused by a damaged Word Data key in
the Windows registry. If this is the case, you need to delete the Data key. When
you restart Microsoft Word, Word recreates the Word Data key automatically.

IMPORTANT: After you delete the Word Data key, some settings in Microsoft Word
are reset to their default settings.

To delete the Word Data key in the Windows registry, follow these steps:

1. Quit all Windows applications.

2. On the Windows Start menu, click Run.

3. In the Open box, type "Regedit" (without the quotation marks) and click OK.

4. Open the following registry key:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\8.0\Word

5. Under the Word key, click the Data subkey.

6. On the Edit menu, click Delete.

7. Click Yes to the following message:

  Are you sure you want to delete this key?

8. On the Registry menu, click Exit.

After you delete the Word Data key, restart Microsoft Word and try to print your
Word document. If you can print your Word document, you have resolved the
problem.
