-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft ODBC for Oracle version 2.5, versions Build 2.573.2927, Build 2.573.3513, Build 2.573.3711, Build 2.573.4202, Build 2.573.4403 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a Microsoft Transaction Server (MTS) or Microsoft Distributed Transaction
Server (MS DTC) application encounters errors that are MTS-related or MS
DTC-related, only the following error message is returned to the application:

  DIAG [NA000] [Microsoft][ODBC driver for Oracle][Oracle]ORA-00000: normal,
  successful completion (0)

This error message is misleading in an environment that uses MTS and MS DTC
because it masks the location of the true error and prevents useful error
messages from being returned to the application.

CAUSE
=====

With the current releases of the Oracle ODBC driver (MSORCL32.DLL) and the
MTS/OCI layer (Mtxoci.dll), error messages that are generated by the underlying
MS DTC/MTS layer are not correctly trapped by the Oracle ODBC driver.

The driver incorrectly assumes that the Mtxoci.dll file is reporting only Oracle
errors, and the driver checks the Errors collection for the Oracle connection to
retrieve error information. Because there are no Oracle errors, the only error
message to return is the "normal, successful completion" error message.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Data Access Components service pack that contains this
fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date      Version        Size             File name     
  --------------------------------------------------------
  02/14/00  02.573.5014    138,512 bytes    Msorcl32.dll
  03/04/00  1999.6.904     87,312 bytes     Mtxoci.dll



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================


Steps to Reproduce the Behavior
-------------------------------

1. Configure the Oracle database server to accept only a limited number of
  client connections, such as 15 or 20. This can be done by modifying the
  Processes parameter in the Init"sid" (without the quotation marks).ora file.
  Then, stop and restart the Oracle service.

2. Use Visual Basic to create an ActiveX DLL with one method. Within this
  method, create an ADO connection to an Oracle database by using the Microsoft
  ODBC for Oracle driver, create a simple recordset that selects a few records
  from any table, and then close the recordset and the connection.

3. Compile this DLL and register it under MTS. Mark the DLL as "Requires a New
  Transaction."

4. Create a client application that creates an instance of the new object, and
  calls the single method in a loop of about 10 times.

5. Compile this client application to an .exe, and then launch approximately 10
  instances of it.

6. Notice that some instances of the client application encounter errors when
  attempting to connect to the Oracle server. Several of the returned errors
  are the Ora-00000 "Normal, successful completion" errors.
