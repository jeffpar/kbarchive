-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Server message transfer agent (MTA) stops unexpectedly
and an event similar to the following is logged in the application event log:

  Event Id: 9405
  Source: MSExchangeMTA
  Type: Error
  Category: Field Engineering
  Description: An unexpected error has occurred which may cause the MTA to
  terminate.
  Error: Out of Semaphores

When this problem occurs, no User.dmp file is created, even though the registry
keys that force the MTA to stop (raise exception on fatal error and handle
exceptions) are enabled.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur because static variables are used to hold the semaphores,
rather than dynamic variables.

The Calls.out file shows that the MTA terminates every time with the following

  Thread 52 (01.091) owns semaphore 6601, created by (01.091).

where 6601 is the maximum count of semaphore.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 service pack that contains
this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.
