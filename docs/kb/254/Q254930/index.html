SYMPTOMS
========

A TCP session with a server may seem never to close, even though the client has
requested to close the session. For example, a connection is established between
two Windows NT-based computers. The server application quits, and the server
sends a FIN request (which the network loses). The server state is now
FIN_WAIT_1 or LAST_ACK and the client state is ESTABLISHED. The server will
remain in the FIN_WAIT or last_ack state until a reboot is issued to restore
incoming sessions.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT Server and Workstation

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the client initiates the close of a session, it sends a FIN packet to the
server. If the FIN packet is lost and never reaches the server, the client
should retransmit the FIN packet when it does not receive an ACK response for
the FIN packet. If the client does not retransmit the FIN packet, the server
session does not close and orphans the session.

The server will remain in the FIN_WAIT or last_ack state until a reboot is issued
to restore incoming sessions.

Example of a servers netstat -an:

  TCP nj031fpsb01:nbsession NC031LLAB03.wcc.microsoft.com:1094 LAST_ACK
  TCP nj031fpsb01:nbsession NC031LLAB03.wcc.microsoft.com:1096 LAST_ACK
  TCP nj031fpsb01:nbsession NC031LLAB03.wcc.microsoft.com:1097 LAST_ACK

Refer to the Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) for more information about FIN
WAIT states and TCP state diagrams.
