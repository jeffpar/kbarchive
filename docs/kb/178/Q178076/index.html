SUMMARY
=======

When using the PrintForm method to print a Form, you have no control over the
orientation. This article describes a way to use a PictureBox to print the
client area of a Form in either orientation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The PrintForm method creates its own Device Context and therefore ignores any
Printer object settings. It will just use the default orientation of the current
default printer. Because you cannot change how PrintForm behaves, you must print
another way. You could change printer settings with APIs, print the Form, then
change them back, but a simpler approach is to print from a PictureBox. The
drawback to this method of using PictureBoxes is that you are printing a Bitmap
graphic, so the quality is less than the PrintForm methods. The process
described here uses two PictureBoxes, each one covering the Form. The second
PictureBox is to avoid a shadowing effect caused by a small offset of the redraw
on a single PictureBox. This same technique can be used to print any group of
controls or to print the client area of a Form that is larger than the screen.
It also allows you to print text or other images onto the same page as the
form's (PictureBox's) image.

Example of Using a PictureBox to Print a Form in Any Orientation
----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Create a new Standard EXE Project. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add two PictureBoxes to Form1 so that each nearly covers the Form.

  NOTE: Avoid drawing the second PictureBox within the first. Doing so makes the
  second PictureBox a member of the first. A simple way to avoid the problem is
  to place the origin point of the second PictureBox to the left of the origin
  point of the first PictureBox. Once the second box is drawn, you can resize
  it so that it is the same size as the first PictureBox.

3. Right-mouse click on Picture2 and choose "Send to Back."

4. Place Picture1 on top of Picture2, covering Picture2.

5. Add a CommandButton and some other controls to Picture1, leaving Picture2
  empty.

6. Place this code in the Declarations Section of the module of the Form:

        Private Declare Function SendMessage Lib "user32" Alias _
           "SendMessageA" (ByVal hwnd As Long, ByVal wMsg As Long, _
           ByVal wParam As Long, ByVal lParam As Long) As Long

        Private Const WM_PAINT = &amp;HF
        Private Const WM_PRINT = &amp;H317
        Private Const PRF_CLIENT = &amp;H4&amp;    ' Draw the window's client area
        Private Const PRF_CHILDREN = &amp;H10&amp; ' Draw all visible child windows
        Private Const PRF_OWNED = &amp;H20&amp;    ' Draw all owned windows

        Private Sub Command1_Click()
         Dim rv As Long
         Picture1.SetFocus  ' So that the button doesn't look pressed
         Picture2.AutoRedraw = True
         rv = SendMessage(Picture1.hwnd, WM_PAINT, Picture2.hDC, 0)
         rv = SendMessage(Picture1.hwnd, WM_PRINT, Picture2.hDC, _
            PRF_CHILDREN + PRF_CLIENT + PRF_OWNED)
         Picture2.Picture = Picture2.Image
         Picture2.AutoRedraw = False
         Printer.Orientation = vbPRORLandscape   ' 2
         Printer.Print ""
         Printer.PaintPicture Picture2.Picture, 0, 0
         Printer.CurrentY = Picture2.Height + 200   ' get below image
         Printer.Print "Text on the same page as the image!"
         Printer.EndDoc

         Command1.SetFocus  ' Return Focus
        End Sub

        Private Sub Form_Load()
         Me.Show
         Command1.Caption = "Print Form"
        End Sub

7. Run the Project and click on the "Print Form" button. Note that when you
  click on Command1, "Print Form", it will print the PictureBox and the
  controls it contains in Landscape orientation.
