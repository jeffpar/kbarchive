SYMPTOMS
========

After you install ICMP-fix, the following events may be logged in the system
event log:

  Event ID: 4199
  Source: TCP/IP
  Description: The system detected an address conflict for IP address
  0.0.0.0 with the system having network hardware address
  xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx. Network operations on this system may be disrupted as
  a result.

  Event ID: 26
  Source: Applications Popup

For more information on ICMP-fix, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q143478
  TITLE : Stop 0A in TCPIP.SYS When Receiving Out Of Band (OOB) Data

CAUSE
=====


The ICMP hotfix includes a fix where ARP requests sent from 0.0.0.0 are now
processed. The handling of ARP requests sent from 0.0.0.0 has been introduced
because RFC 1541 suggests that a DHCP client should verify an IP lease offered
from a DHCP server by sending an ARP request. In the RFC, the sender's IP
address is defined as 0.0.0.0.

If a computer is in a state where it has no valid IP address lease (for example,
when starting or when the lease has expired), the computer's TCP/IP stack is
initialized with the address 0.0.0.0.

If, in this state, an ARP request with sender's IP address 0.0.0.0 is received,
the above events will be logged.

For additional information on the ICMP hotfix, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q154174
  TITLE : Invalid ICMP Datagram Fragments Hang Windows NT, Windows 95
