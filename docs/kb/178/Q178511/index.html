-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.0, 5.5 
- Microsoft Outlook Web Access, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are attempting to log on to a Microsoft Exchange Server computer using
Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA), you may receive the following error
message:

  Failed to connect to the Microsoft Exchange Server, &lt;servername&gt;.

CAUSE
=====

This error can be caused by incorrect permissions being set on the Winnt
directory or all of its sub-directories or both. Additionally, incorrect
permissions on the Exchsrvr\Webdata directory and all of its sub- directories,
or incorrect permissions on the Exchsrvr\Webtemp directory and all of its
sub-directories may cause the error to occur.

WORKAROUND
==========

If you are using Exchange Server version 5.0, the Winnt directory and all of its
subdirectories must have Change permissions set on them for the Domain Users
group. The Winnt\System32 directory must have at least Read permissions set for
the Domain Users group.

When you use Microsoft Exchange Active Server Components to access information on
a computer running Microsoft Exchange Server, files with an .mmp extension are
created in your Winnt directory by default.

The .mmp file is a temporary file used by Active Messaging to store certain
profile information during the active session. This file should be deleted after
the user logs off and the session is closed.

Because these files must be created dynamically, the Microsoft Internet
Information Server (IIS) Anonymous Logon account (IUSR_Server by default) needs
to have Change permissions on the Winnt directory. Refer to Microsoft Knowledge
Base article Q166599, "XWEB: .MMP File Created by MS Exchange Active Server,"
for an optional workaround to having Change permissions on the Winnt directory.

If you are using Exchange Server version 5.0 Service Pack 1 or later, verify that
the Winnt directory and all of its sub-directories have at least Read
permissions set on them for the Domain Users group. Verify that the
Winnt\System32 directory has at least Read permissions set for the Domain User
group.

If you are using Exchange Server version 5.5 or later, no special permissions
have to be set on the Winnt directory.

You may need to change the permissions on the Exchsrvr\Webdata directory and all
of its sub-directories to Read. Verify also that the Exchsrvr\Webtemp directory
and all of its sub-directories are set to Change.
