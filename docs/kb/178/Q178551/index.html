SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Microsoft Flight Simulator 98, you may receive one or more of the
following error messages:

- Fltsim98.exe caused an Exception Error in module Panels.dll.
- Fltsim98 caused an exception 10H in module Panels.dll.
- Fltsim98 caused an invalid page fault in module Panels.DLL

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur for any of the following reasons:

- You have not downloaded Flight Simulator 98 Patch Set 1.0.
- You are running background terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs or
  other unnecessary programs when you start Flight Simulator.
- You are loading drivers for the Miro DC10 or DC30 video capture cards.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following methods:

Obtain Flight Simulator 98 Patch Set 1.0
----------------------------------------

Download and install Flight Simulator 98 Patch Set 1.0 from the following
Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/games/products.asp?filter=fsim

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Quit All Unnecessary Programs
-----------------------------

Quit all unnecessary programs that are running before you start Flight Simulator
98. To do so, use the following steps:

1. Restart the computer at a command prompt. To do so, follow the steps in the
  appropriate section below:

  Microsoft Windows 95
  --------------------

  Restart your computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, press
  the F8 key, and then choose Command Prompt Only from the Startup menu.

  Microsoft Windows 98
  --------------------

  Restart your computer, press and hold down the CTRL key after your computer
  completes the Power On Self Test (POST), and then choose Command Prompt Only
  from the Startup menu.

2. Start Windows by typing "win" (without the quotation marks) and holding down
  the SHIFT key for the duration of Windows startup. This prevents any programs
  from loading automatically at startup.

3. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE to open the Close Program dialog box.

4. Quit all programs except Explorer and Systray (which are parts of Windows).
  To quit a program, click the program, and then click End Task.

5. Repeat steps 3-4 until you have quit all programs except Explorer and
  Systray.

6. Disable any anti-virus or disk tool programs installed on the computer. For
  information about how to disable these programs, see the printed or online
  documentation for the program.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Disable Drivers for the Miro DC10 or DC30 Video Capture Cards
-------------------------------------------------------------

If the Miro DC10 or DC30 video capture card is installed on your system, use the
following steps to disable the drivers for the video capture card:

1. Open the Miro Control Panel.

2. Click the Use As Default check box to clear it.

3. Close the Miro Control Panel, and then restart the computer.

If the Miro DC10 or DC30 video capture card is no longer installed on your
system, use the following steps to disable the drivers for the video capture
card:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "system.ini" (without the quotation marks), and then
  click OK.

3. On the Search menu, click Find.

4. In the Find What box, type "miro" (without the quotation marks), and then
  click Find Next.

5. If a line containing this text is found, disable the line by typing a
  SEMICOLON (;) at the beginning of the line, and then click Find Next.

6. Repeat this step until you receive the following message,

  Cannot Find "miro"

  and then click OK.

7. On the File menu, click Save.

8. On the File menu, click Exit.

9. Restart the computer.
