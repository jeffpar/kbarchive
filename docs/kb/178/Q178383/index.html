-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 
- Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 Professional Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start Flight Simulator 2000, or fly an Adventure in Flight Simulator
98, you may receive an error message similar to the following:

  FLTSIM98 CD-US South Central

  This performance booster source directory was not found. Insert the Flight
  Simulator CD-ROM and press RETRY, or press OK to ignore this booster for this
  session.

When you fly an Adventure in Flight Simulator 2000, you may receive an error
message similar to the following:

  Insert CD into any drive and continue. CD="FS2KCD2"

In addition, the scenery and graphics in the Adventure may disappear, you may not
hear the voices of the Adventure Pilot, the Co-Pilot, or the Air Traffic
Controller (ATC), and VOR navigation may not function properly.


CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Flight Simulator 98 CD-ROM or Flight Simulator
2000 Disc 2 CD-ROM is not inserted into the CD-ROM drive.

When you fly an Adventure, Flight Simulator may need the sound and scenery files
for the Adventure that are located on the Flight Simulator CD-ROM.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following methods in the order in which they are
presented.

Insert the CD-ROM for Your Version of Flight Simulator
------------------------------------------------------

If the Flight Simulator 98 CD-ROM or the Flight Simulator 2000 Disc 2 CD-ROM is
not inserted in the CD-ROM drive, insert it, wait 10-15 seconds, and then click
Retry.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Clean the Flight Simulator CD-ROM
---------------------------------

Clean the CD-ROM to remove dust, smudges, and fingerprints. To do this, use a
CD-ROM cleaning kit, or gently wipe the silver side of the CD-ROM with a soft,
lint-free cotton cloth. Do not use paper cloth which can scratch the plastic and
leave streaks. When you clean the CD-ROM, wipe from the center of the disc
outward; do not use a circular motion.


If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Remove and Reinstall Flight Simulator 98 or Flight Simulator 2000
-----------------------------------------------------------------

To do this:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

3. On the Install/Uninstall tab, click Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 or
  Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000, and then click Add/Remove.

4. Follow the instructions on the screen to remove your version of Flight
  Simulator.

5. Close Control Panel.

6. Delete the folder in which Flight Simulator is installed.

  By default, Flight Simulator 98 is installed in the following folder:

  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator

  By default, Flight Simulator 2000 is installed in the following folder:

  C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\FS2000

  For information about how to delete folders, click Start, and then click Help.
  On the Index tab, type "deleting" (without the quotation marks), and then
  double-click the "Deleting files or folders" topic.

7. Insert the Flight Simulator 98 CD-ROM or the Flight Simulator 2000 Disc 1
  CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive.

  If Flight Simulator Setup does not start automatically, click Start, click
  Run, type the following line in the Open box, and then click OK

  &lt;drive&gt;:\setup.exe

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive.

8. Follow the instructions on the screen to install Flight Simulator.

  NOTE: To improve performance and run Flight Simulator without inserting the
  Flight Simulator CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive, install the Adventure files on
  the hard disk. To do this:

  a. When you are prompted to select a Setup option, click Custom, and then
     click Add All.

  b. Click to select the Install Adventures and "Copy adventure sound files to
     hard disk to improve performance" check boxes, and then click OK.
