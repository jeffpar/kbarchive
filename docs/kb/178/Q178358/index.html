SUMMARY
=======

This article includes information about using Internet Explorer with the October
1997 release of the Microsoft Developer Network Library (MSDN).

In order for the MSDN Library to function properly, Microsoft Internet Explorer
version 3.01 or higher should be installed on your system. The version of
Internet Explorer that you install, should be a released non- beta version,
Internet Explorer 4.0 is fully supported. There are some features and known
problems using Internet Explorer 4.0 with the MSDN Library that are addressed in
this document.

MORE INFORMATION
================

INSTALLING INTERNET EXPLORER WITH THE MSDN LIBRARY

If you do not have Internet Explorer 3.01 or higher installed, you will be
prompted during MSDN Setup to install Internet Explorer version 3.02. When you
select Yes, MSDN setup will halt and display a dialog box saying, "MSDN Setup
was not completed successfully." You must click OK, complete Internet Explorer
setup, and then reboot. You must then restart MSDN setup. If you select No, you
will be required to install Internet Explorer manually.

The U.S. English Internet Explorer Version 3.02b, which includes the Authenticode
2.0 update, is available on the October 1997 MSDN Library CD1 in the \IE
subdirectory. To install, run the file Msie302.exe.

To download the latest version of Internet Explorer, connect to

USING INTERNET EXPLORER 4.0

Accessibility Enhancements
--------------------------

Internet Explorer 4.0 includes some new accessibility features that can be used
within InfoViewer and the MSDN Library. You now have the ability to specify your
own color, font, style settings so that your settings always override settings
specified by an MSDN topic or Web site. You can change these settings in
Internet Explorer 4.0 by selecting Internet Options from the View menu, then
clicking on the Accessibility button under the General tab. You can modify the
following settings.

Ignore Colors Specified on Web Pages
------------------------------------

This option specifies whether you want Internet Explorer to use the color
settings you choose for text, background, and links. You can set these colors on
the General tab by clicking the Colors button. If the author of a Web page
chooses different colors for text and background, the settings you choose here
will override them. You cannot change the size or color of graphics.

Ignore Font Styles Specified on Web Pages
-----------------------------------------

The option specifies whether you want Internet Explorer to use the font settings
you choose. You can set these types on the General tab by clicking the Fonts
button. If the author of a Web page chooses different fonts, the settings you
choose here will override them. You cannot change the size or color of
graphics.

Ignore Font Sizes Specified on Web Pages
----------------------------------------

This option specifies whether you want Internet Explorer to use the default font
size you choose. You can set the default font size on the General tab by
clicking the Fonts button. If the author of a Web page chooses a different
default font size, the settings you choose here will override it. You cannot
change the size or color of graphics.

User Style Sheet
----------------

This option specifies whether you want Internet Explorer to use your own style
sheet to format all Web pages when they are displayed, and provides a place for
you to type the path to your style sheet. Style sheets can specify the default
font style, size, colors, and background for the body text in addition to
headings.

Problems Accessing Sample Data
------------------------------

Users of the Integrated Development Environment for Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0,
Visual InterDev 1.0, or Visual J++ 1.1 who also have Microsoft Internet Explorer
4.0 installed will receive the following error when selecting a URL in an MSDN
title that accesses samples:

  Error Accessing Sample Data

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem with Visual Studio 97 development
products. This problem was corrected in Visual Studio 97 service Pack 2. The
Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 2 is available from the Microsoft Web Site at:

  http://www.msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/sp/.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q170365 INFO: Visual Studio 97 Service Packs - What, Where, and Why

This bug also affects the standalone versions of the MSDN Library prior to
October 1997. The October release of the Microsoft Development Library includes
an update required by Internet Explorer 4.0 users who want to access samples
from within an MSDN title. This update affects only the MSDN executable,
Iv5.exe. Users of the IDE who wish to benefit from this fix as well can get it
one of two ways:

- Install the Visual Studio 97 Service Pack 2

  -or-

- Copy the file containing the fix, Ivauto.dll, from the MSDN CD1 to the
  directory containing IDE executable. For example, if you installed Visual C++
  to its default directory, C:\Program Files\DevStudio, you would copy
  Ivauto.dll as follows:

     From:  Disc 1 subdirectory  \x86\bin\IVAUTO.DLL
     To:  C:\Program Files\DevStudio\SharedIDE\Bin\IVAUTO.DLL

Problem with Font Sizes Appearing Very Small in Some Topics
-----------------------------------------------------------

This problem is caused by changes in stylesheet support in Internet Explorer 4.0.
The best workaround is to change your accessibility settings in Internet
Explorer 4.0 and choose to ignore font sizes. This problem will be fixed in the
documentation of a future release of the MSDN Library.

Problem with Very Narrow Table Columns in MFC Documentation
-----------------------------------------------------------

Some documentation for MFC in Visual C++ 5.0 will appear improperly formatted
when using Internet Explorer 4.0. The Class Members topics in the Class Library
reference uses table columns that are formatted incorrectly using hardcoded
point sizes. The descriptions display as a very narrow column. There is no good
workaround for this problem. The MSDN team will fix this in the next quarterly
library release.

Transact SQL Topic is Blacked Out
---------------------------------

This problem is caused by a mistake in the underlying HTML. The background color
setting is incorrectly authored. The good news is there is no documentation in
this section. It is a simple reference to the new location of the Transact SQL
documentation. The documentation titled "Transact-SQL Reference" is now
integrated with the Platform SDK documentation on the MSDN Library. You can find
this information in the Microsoft SQL Server Programmer's Toolkit located in the
Database and Messaging Services section of the Platform SDK.

Known Problems in Internet Explorer 4.0 Beta Preview Releases
-------------------------------------------------------------

- Downloading samples from an MSDN topic did not work at all in some Internet
  Explorer 4.0 preview releases. This was fixed in newer releases. Connect to:

  http://www.msdn.microsoft.com

  to download the latest version of Internet Explorer.

- Downloading samples with a space in the filename does not work. You may
  receive the following error message:

  Error copying file

  If you experience this problem then you may need to use Internet Explorer 3.02
  or download the file from the MSDN Library Online at
  http:/msdn.microsoft.com/msdn/library/.

- Some Internet Explorer 4.0 beta releases had prevented InfoViewer users from
  changing the font size of topics. This has been corrected. Connect to:

  http://www.msdn.microsoft.com

  to download the latest version of Internet Explorer.

- Some Internet Explorer 4.0 preview releases caused crashes when viewing
  InfoViewer Titles if ratings were enabled. This has also been fixed.
