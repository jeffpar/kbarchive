The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Windows 95/98 client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
- Microsoft Exchange Windows 3.x client, versions 4.0, 5.0 
- Microsoft Outlook 97, versions 8.0, 8.01, 8.02, 8.03 
- Microsoft Outlook, Exchange Server Edition, version 8.0, used with:
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

In the Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Outlook clients, it is not possible to
open a read-only Personal Folder (.PST) or Personal Address Book (PAB) file.

You may receive the following error message if you attempt to open a read- only
.PST file:

  Unable to display the folder. File access is denied. You do not have the
  permission required to access the file C:\Outlook\outlook.pst

You may receive the following error message if you attempt to access a read- only
Personal Address Book (PAB) file:

  Your personal address book could not be opened. The file is either not
  accessible or is not a personal address book. Choose Retry to use your
  personal address book, or choose Cancel to not use your personal address
  book with this application.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. Because of the way that the Microsoft Exchange and
Microsoft Outlook clients access these files, .PST and PAB files must be opened
for read/write access in order to function properly.

WORKAROUND
==========

If possible, remove the read-only attribute of the file prior to opening it. If
the file is located on a shared network drive or on a CD-ROM drive, copy the
file to your local hard drive and verify that the read-only attribute is not
set.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior usually occurs when a user attempts to access a .PST or PAB file
located on a shared read-only drive or a file located on a CD-ROM drive.
