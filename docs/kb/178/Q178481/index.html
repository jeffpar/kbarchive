CAUSE
=====

You may have selected Outlook Express as your default e-mail program and made
Outlook Express the default simple MAPI client.

WORKAROUND
==========

Do not set Outlook Express as the default simple MAPI client. Outlook Express
was designed for use with Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.x. While you can use
Outlook Express to send e-mail from Word, the Outlook Express Address Book is
not designed for use with Word.

NOTE: To send e-mail from Word, point to Send To on the File menu, and then click
Mail recipient.

Clearing the Simple MAPI Client Check Box
-----------------------------------------

To clear the Simple MAPI client check box, follow these steps:

1. In Outlook Express, on the Tools menu, click Options.

2. On the General tab, click to clear the "Make Outlook Express my default
  Simple MAPI client" check box.

  NOTE: The "Make Outlook Express my default Simple MAPI client" check box is
  not available unless the "Make Outlook Express my default e-mail program"
  check box is selected. This check box is also not available for Outlook
  Express 5.0.

You may need to restart your computer, or reinstall Microsoft Office or Outlook
after clearing the "Make Outlook Express my default Simple MAPI client" check
box. After you restart your computer or reinstall Office or Outlook, your
previous address book should again function correctly with Word.


MORE INFORMATION
================

When you send a document from Word as an e-mail message, the e-mail program that
is set as your default simple MAPI client is used to send the document.

NOTE: To send your Word document as an e-mail message, point to Send To on the
File menu and then click Mail Recipient.

The following information explains the purpose and functionality of the options
that are required to use Microsoft Outlook Express with Word.

"Make Outlook Express my default e-mail program" Check Box
----------------------------------------------------------

Specifies whether to use Outlook Express whenever you click a link in a Web page
to send an e-mail message or choose the mail command in your Web browser.

"Make Outlook Express my default Simple MAPI client" Check Box
--------------------------------------------------------------

Specifies whether Outlook Express is used when you send documents from within
other applications by using the Send command on the File menu. Selecting this
check box disables both the Microsoft Exchange and Microsoft Outlook mail
programs.
