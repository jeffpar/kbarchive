Question:

Why am I limited to allocating 128K with halloc() or a huge array
unless the size of the elements I am using is a power of 2?

Response:

With huge pointers and arrays, the Microsoft C Compiler produces
32-bit pointer arithmetic only when accessing whole elements. Only the
16-bit offset of a pointer is used when accessing the individual
members of elements. This technique is used in the interest of speed
and smaller code size. However, it assumes that elements do not extend
from the end of one segment into the beginning of the next. When
crossing a 64K segment boundary, elements must end evenly with the end
of that segment. The following diagram illustrates the conditions
necessary for huge pointers and arrays:

                         Seg1 Seg2
     Segment 1               FFFF 0000               Segment 2
     ----------------------------+----------------------------
    ......| Elem | Elem  | Elem  + Elem  | Elem  | Elem  |.....
    ......| X     | X+1  | X+2   + X+3   | X+4   | X+5   |.....
     ----------------------------+----------------------------
                                 ^ Elements must not cross
                   a segment boundary.

If an element's size is not a power of 2, an array of that element
will not fit evenly into a 64K segment. This is the root of the 128K
limitation. To avoid breaking an element across a segment boundary in
this case, extra space is left at the beginning of the first segment,
pushing the entire array upwards in memory so that the element before
the one that would have spanned the segment boundary ends exactly at
the segment ending. The element that would have spanned the segment
boundary is pushed to the beginning of the second segment.

If the allocated elements do not fit evenly into a segment, there can
be only one segment boundary onto which they fall evenly. The function
halloc() uses the element size it is passed to calculate and return a
pointer with an offset that results in the allocated elements falling
evenly on this boundary. The following diagram demonstrates the way
this is done and what can happen at the end of the second segment:

        Segment 1                     Segment 2
        0000           FFFF 0000           FFFF
     +----------------------+-------------------+
     +Pad |Elem |Elem |Elem +Elem |Elem |Elem | +
     +----------------------+-------------------+
      ^   ^                                   ^
      ^   ^                                   Next element will not fall
      ^   ^                                   on segment bounds.
      ^   ^
      ^   Offset returned to allow elements to fall on segment bounds.
      ^
      Padding area used to force element boundary to fall on segment
      boundary

These restrictions should also be considered when allocating memory
for very large elements. For example, a request for three 33K
structures will fail. Two of the structures could be allocated, but
since each would go into a separate segment, neither of the segments
would contain enough space for the third element.
