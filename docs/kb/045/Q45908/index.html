Batch (.BAT) files can be executed only from a BASIC program SHELL
statement. The RUN and CHAIN statement cannot be used to execute a
batch file.

This information applies to the following BASIC products:

1. Microsoft GW-BASIC Versions 3.20, 3.22, and 3.23

2. QuickBASIC Versions 1.00, 1.01, 1.02, 2.00, 2.01, 3.00, 4.00,
   4.00b, and 4.50

3. Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 6.00, and 6.00b for MS-DOS and
   MS OS/2.

4. Microsoft BASIC PDS Version 7.00 for MS-DOS and MS OS/2.

The SHELL statement can be used to execute a .COM, .EXE, or .BAT file,
or almost any MS-DOS command, and then return to the original BASIC
program. However, the SHELL statement cannot pass any information or
variables to the program or statement it is executing.

The statement or program being executed from the SHELL statement is
being executed as a "child" process of BASIC. The BASIC program is
exited (but remains in memory), the command string is executed, and
then control is returned to the BASIC program. Two methods can be used
to pass information down to a batch file:

1. Write the information to a file and have the batch file access the
   file for the necessary information.

2. Set a special environment variable with ENVIRON that can be read
   by the batch file.

The RUN and CHAIN statements expect to RUN or CHAIN to a program that
has an extension of .BAS or .EXE, depending on whether the program is
being executed within the QB.EXE or QBX.EXE environment or as a compiled
application.

For more information, consult the BASIC language reference manual
included with your BASIC package.
