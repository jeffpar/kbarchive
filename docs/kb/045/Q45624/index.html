Question:

How can I view structures with many members in CodeView with the "??"
command? It shows only those members that fit on the screen. Is there
some trick I haven't found?

Response:

Unfortunately, the "??" command is limited in this respect -- there is
no way to view the last members of a large structure with this
command. This feature is under review and will be considered for
inclusion in a future release.

Instead, however, you can view each element of the structure by itself
by dereferencing the struct and element, i.e., "?structname.field".

There are at least two ways to work around the problem in CodeView
Versions 2.20 and 2.30. One way is to shrink or nest the structures.
Another workaround is to use the "?" or Watch command to look at the
individual member(s) you want to see.
