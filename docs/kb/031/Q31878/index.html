As of June 1988, Microsoft offers the run-time license agreement shown
below for its language compilers, including the following:

1. QuickBASIC Versions 2.00, 2.01, 3.00, 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50 for the
   IBM PC and compatibles

2. Microsoft BASIC Compiler Versions 5.35 and 5.36 for MS-DOS, and
   Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS and MS OS/2

3. Microsoft BASIC PDS Version 7.00 for MS-DOS and MS OS/2

4. QuickBASIC Version 1.00 for the Apple Macintosh

5. Microsoft BASIC Compiler Version 1.00 for the Apple Macintosh

6. Microsoft COBOL Compiler Versions 2.00, 2.10, 2.20 for MS-DOS;
   Versions 3.00 and 3.00a for MS-DOS and MS OS/2; and Versions 2.10
   and 2.20 for XENIX

The agreement allows you to distribute your programs on a royalty-free
basis.

You can read this agreement on the back of the "break-the-seal" disk
envelope (paragraph number 2) for the compiler. The agreement reads as
follows:

   DISTRIBUTION OF RUNTIME MODULES: Microsoft grants to you a
   royalty-free right to reproduce and distribute the runtime modules
   of the COMPILER provided that you: (a) distribute the runtime
   modules only in conjunction with and as a part of your own software
   product; (b) do not use Microsoft's name, logo, or trademarks to
   market your software product; (c) include Microsoft's copyright
   notice for the COMPILER on your product label and as part of the
   sign-on message for your software product; and (d) otherwise comply
   with this Agreement. The "run-time modules" are those files in the
   COMPILER that are identified in the documentation as required
   during execution of your compiled program. The runtime modules are
   limited to runtime files, install files, and ISAM and REBUILD
   files.

If you are interested in receiving a complete copy of the latest
run-time license agreement, contact the Microsoft Information Center
by calling (800) 426-9400 or (206) 882-8088.
