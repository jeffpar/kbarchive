The Toshiba T1200 computer is not officially supported by QuickBASIC.

The dedicated cursor keys on the Toshiba T1200 may not work correctly
with the QB.EXE Versions 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50 editors, except as
explained in a separate article in this database. For more
information, query on the following words:

   Toshiba and dedicated

You can obtain an alternative set of working cursor keys on the
Toshiba T1200 by using FUNCTION+NUM LOCK as a toggle to activate a
10-key keypad in the middle of the regular keyboard, as shown below.

Also, according to Toshiba Product Support, the Toshiba T1200 comes
with a program called SETUP1.EXE or SETUP12.EXE that has a 101-key
installation option that makes the cursor keys behave normally (even
though the Toshiba only has 84 keys). The Toshiba T5100 and Toshiba
T3100 come with the program TEST3.EXE, which serves the same purpose.

This information applies to QuickBASIC Versions 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50,
to the QuickBASIC editor that comes with Microsoft BASIC Compiler
Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS and MS OS/2, and to the QBX.EXE
editor that comes with Microsoft BASIC PDS Version 7.0 for MS-DOS and
MS OS/2.

When running QB.EXE (or QBX.EXE from BASIC PDS Version 7.00) on the
Toshiba T1200, you can activate a 10-key keypad in the middle of the
typewriter keyboard by holding down the FUNCTION key and pressing NUM
LOCK. Subsequently pressing NUM LOCK alone switches between numbers
and cursor functions. To return to typewriter mode, press FUNCTION+NUM
LOCK again.

The numeric keypad is mapped as follows:

   Typewriter Keys      Numeric       Cursor
   ---------------      -------       ------

   7  8  9              7  8  9       HOME   UP    PGUP

   U  I  O              4  5  6       LEFT   ----  RIGHT

   J  K  L              1  2  3       END    DOWN  PGDN

   M  ,                 0  .          INS    DEL   ----

Selecting text and performing other cursor-oriented features of
QuickBASIC Version 4.00 works correctly using the above regular
keyboard keys as your keypad, instead of using the dedicated cursor
keys.
