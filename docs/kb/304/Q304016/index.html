The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

After you run a Systems Management Server (SMS) software inventory scan on a
Microsoft Exchange Server 2000-based server, you may notice that the "Last
Logged On By" and "Last Logon Time" columns in the Exchange System Manager tool
have changed. The "Last Logged On By" column displays "SMSCliToknAcct&amp;" as
the account name and the "Last Logon Time" column matches the date and time the
software inventory scan last ran. Depending on the number of mailboxes, the
software inventory scan could take hours to finish.

Note that accessing the mailbox folders on the Exchange Installable File System
(IFS) drive (which defaults to drive M) with a domain administrator account has
the same effect on the "Last Logged On By" and "Last Logon Time" columns.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because the SMS Software Inventory agent recognizes the
Exchange Server 2000 IFS drive as a fixed drive rather than as an IFS drive and
scans the drive during its inventory cycle.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Systems Management Server service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English Service Pack 2 (SP2) version of this fix should have the following
file attributes or later:

  Date         Time   Version         Size     File name        Platform

also resolves this issue, and vice versa. For additional information, click the

contains the above files may also contain additional files.





WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

You can make the following registry change to hide the IFS drive from Windows
Explorer and prevent SMS from scanning the drive:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate and click the following value in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EXIFS\Parameters\DriveLetter

3. Change the data value to be blank (clear the M and do not leave a space).

4. Reboot the server.

IMPORTANT: Hiding the Exchange IFS drive by modifying the registry value may
prevent Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA) from functioning properly.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
