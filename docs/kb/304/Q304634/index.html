SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to properly set the Microsoft SQL Server version 7.0
compatibility level for Systems Management Server (SMS) version 2.0. SQL Server
7.0 provides the option of running in a compatibility mode that emulates SQL
Server 6.0 or 6.5 behavior. You can run Compatibility mode so that legacy
programs can continue to run and interact with SQL as they did before the
upgrade to SQL Server 7.0.

Because SMS 2.0 is able to fully utilize the advanced features of SQL Server 7.0
and does not require legacy support, you should always run the SMS database in
SQL Server 7.0 mode.

If you run SQL Server in a compatibility mode that is lower than version 7.0, you
cannot take advantage of certain SQL Server 7.0 features that are not enabled at
lower compatibility levels. In addition, support for these legacy behaviors may
not be included in future versions of SQL Server.

When you set a SQL Server compatibility level, the setting affects the behaviors
in the database you specify, not the entire SQL server. Because of this (even in
the unlikely event that SMS 2.0 shares an SQL server with legacy programs that
are running in an SQL 60 or 65 compatibility level), you should still run the
SMS database in SQL 70 mode for maximum performance and compatibility.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The compatibility level is specified for each database by using the
sp_dbcmptlevel system stored procedure. Note that you can determine the current
compatibility level of your database by running "sp_dbcmptlevel DATABASENAME"
(without the quotation marks) in the SQL Query Analyzer tool. The database
compatibility level can be set to 60 (version 6.0 compatibility), 65 (version
6.5 compatibility) and the default of 70 (version 7.0 compatibility).

An upgrade from an earlier version of SQL Server to version 7.0 sets the
compatibility level of existing user-defined databases to the version of SQL
Server from which you are upgrading. For example, if your server was a version
6.5 server before you upgraded to SQL Server 7.0, the compatibility level for
all your existing user-defined databases is set to 65.
