  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

After you establish a Systems Management Server (SMS) remote control session to
a client computer, you may lost mouse and keyboard functionality, but you may
still be able to view the remote desktop.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur after the SMS client is removed. When this happens, the
mouse and keyboard drivers for SMS remote control may not have been removed
correctly. When the SMS client is then re-installed, the SMS remote control
information that is left behind from the previous installation can prevent the
proper re-installation of the drivers. This incomplete removal can happen during
operating system upgrades or manual client removals.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To work around this problem:

1. Uninstall the SMS client by using the 20clicln.bat tool from the SMS support
  tools that you can obtain from the Microsoft Web site.

2. After you remove the SMS client, use Registry Editor to delete the following
  registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CUrrentControlSet\Services\Wuser32

3. Reinstall the SMS client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
