-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to install the Systems Management Server (SMS) client on a Microsoft
Windows NT-based backup domain controller (BDC) or Microsoft Windows 2000-based
domain controller may not succeed. When this occurs, the following error message
is generated in the %SystemRoot%\MS\SMS\Logs\Wnremote.log file:

  ERROR: Could not create global group on PDC (1326)
  ERROR: Unable to create the Client Service Account. Win32 Error: 1326
  Warning: Could not launch/register CCIM - 1326
  UpdateClientRegistryForCCIMLaunch returned Logon failure: unknown user name or
  bad password.

Because of this issue, several installation attempts may be made, causing
additional replication traffic in the domain.

CAUSE
=====

This issue occurs because the SMS client bootstrap loader does not wait long
enough for a child process (Ccmboot.exe) to finish the account synchronization
of the SMS Client Service account (SMS&amp;_&lt;Computername&gt;). When it
stops, Client Configuration Manager (CCM) on the SMS site server waits 15
minutes, then deletes the SMS Client bootstrap account
(SMS#_&lt;Computername&gt;). Therefore, the Ccmboot.exe process, which is
running under the SMS#_&lt;Computername&gt; context, cannot successfully
complete the account-configuration process for the SMS&amp;_&lt;Computername&gt;
account.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q288239 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

For Windows NT-based environments, manually trigger the synchronization of the
BDC with the primary domain controller (PDC) by using Server Manager
approximately 10 minutes after the remote client installation is initiated for
that computer. You need to force a synchronization with the PDC after the
SMS&amp;_&lt;Computername&gt; account is created, but before the SMS Client
Bootstrap service times out while waiting for Ccmboot.exe to finish. Monitor the
Wnremote.log file in the %SystemRoot%\MS\SMS\Logs folder. Force the
synchronization as soon as the following message appears:

  Waiting for PDC/BDC Sync (2221)

NOTE: Forcing the replication may create additional or unwanted network traffic,
particularly over slow network links. If you are considering using this
workaround, you may want to avoid using it on several BDCs simultaneously. You
may want to stagger the SMS client installations on domain controllers after
hours or on a weekend.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4.
