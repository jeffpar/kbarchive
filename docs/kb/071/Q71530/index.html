SUMMARY
=======

Hewlett-Packard (HP) Intellifont-for-Windows 3.0 is a font utility package that
provides scalable screen fonts to match available printer fonts used on the HP
LaserJet III and IIID printers. The package also includes a PCL 5 printer driver
for use with Windows 3.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

HP Intellifont-for-Windows 3.0 package adds the following to your Windows 3.0
setup:

- HP Intellifont-for-Windows 3.0 application icon

- Intellifont screen font driver: for automatic on-the-fly screen fonts

- Eight scalable typefaces: from the CG Times and Univers families

- HP Font Installer: for scalable typefaces and bitmapped printer fonts

- PCL 5 Printer Driver: for HP LaserJet III and IIID printers

- Help files: for quick information

Screen Font Driver
------------------

HP Intellifont-for-Windows 3.0 includes a screen-font driver that automatically
creates screen fonts from scalable typeface files at all point sizes supported
by Windows 3.0. The screen fonts are created "on-the- fly," eliminating the need
to use memory for traditional bitmapped screen fonts. The HP
Intellifont-for-Windows 3.0 screen font driver can only create scalable screen
fonts for scalable typeface products. Windows 3.0 displays representative screen
fonts for other kinds of fonts.

Eight Scalable Typefaces
------------------------

Eight scalable typefaces from the CG Times and Univers families are included with
HP Intellifont-for-Windows 3.0. These typefaces match the resident typefaces in
the HP LaserJet III and IIID printers and are the source of scalable screen
fonts. Both typefaces are available in regular, bold, italic, and bold italic
styles. Optional typefaces are available from HP.

HP Font Installer and Compatible Fonts
--------------------------------------

Using the HP Font Installer, you can install the following font products for use
in Windows 3.0:

- Scalable typefaces

- Bitmapped printer fonts: cartridge or disk-based (soft)

- Scalable printer fonts: through AutoFont Support utilities

- Printer Cartridge Metric (.PCM) files

Disk-based (soft) bitmapped printer fonts must be in PCL format for HP LaserJet
printers. Scalable typeface products must be in AGFA Compugraphic's FAIS format.
All other font products require AutoFont Support files or .PCM files.

PCL 5 Printer Driver
--------------------

HP Intellifont-for-Windows 3.0 includes an upgraded PCL 5 printer driver. The new
driver (version 3.77) allows selections for: printer model, paper source (tray),
paper size, printer memory size, Page Protection status, orientation, installed
font cartridges, graphics resolution, gray scale, and number of copies. The PCL
5 Printer Driver contains special code that allows Windows 3.00 software
applications to access the advanced features of the HP LaserJet III and IIID
printers such as: pattern shades; multiple print directions on a single page;
and mirrored, shadowed, and reverse (white on black) printing.

To improve graphic image printing, three new gray scale settings are available.
Try printing your graphics with the different gray scale settings to choose the
one that looks best to you.

Help Files
----------

Updated online help information is supplied for the new HP Intellifont-for-
Windows 3.0 icon, PCL 5 Printer Driver, and HP Font Installer windows. Help
files contain step-by-step procedures for installing accessory typeface and font
products along with definitions of terms.

Use Help any time you need to review a procedure (remember, with Windows 3.0, you
can print a help topic any time).

we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance
or reliability.
