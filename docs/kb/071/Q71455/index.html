SUMMARY
=======

The term "system resources" refers to two scarce system-wide resources: the USER
heap and the GDI heap. These two segments are each limited to 64K, and they are
both shared by all the applications running under Windows.

During development of a Windows-based application, it is important to make sure
that all the system resources allocated by the application at run time are
released when the application terminates.

If too many system resources are lost, and either the USER heap or the GDI heap
gets too full, performance will degrade for the entire Windows system.

The information below discusses how system resources can be "lost" by an
application, and how to track down and correct such problems when they occur. In
particular, it discusses:

- Free System Resources -- A rough gauge of system resource use.

- The GDI Heap -- The types of objects that are allocated in the GDI heap, and
  general rules for making sure that these objects are properly released.

- The USER Heap -- The types of objects that are allocated in the USER heap,
  and general rules for making sure that these objects are properly released.

- Troubleshooting and Heap Walker -- Specific techniques and tools for tracking
  down lost system resources.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Free System Resources
---------------------

The Program Manager's About Program Manager dialog box displays a Free System
Resources value. This value indicates the amount of room left in the heap (USER
or GDI) with the smallest amount of free space. There is no Windows API call
that an application can use to obtain this value.

The easiest way to tell if an application is losing system resources is to
examine Program Manager's Free System Resources value before and after running
the application. It is acceptable if this value goes down a little the first
time the application is run, however if the value decreases every time the
application runs and exits, system resources are being allocated and not
released.

The GDI Heap
------------

There are six GDI objects that a Windows program can create: pens, brushes,
fonts, bitmaps, regions, and palettes. Space for each of these objects is
allocated in the GDI heap.

Normally, the life cycle of a GDI object requires that the following steps be
performed:

1. Create the GDI object.

2. Use the object.

3. Delete the object.

The DeleteObject call is used to delete most GDI objects.

The three general rules for deleting GDI objects are:

- An application deletes all GDI objects that it creates.

- Do not delete GDI objects while they are selected into a valid device
  context.

- Do not delete stock objects.

Also, the following calls should always be matched:

     CreateDC           -&gt; DeleteDC
     CreateCompatibleDC -&gt; DeleteDC
     CreateIC           -&gt; DeleteDC
     GetDC              -&gt; ReleaseDC
     BeginPaint         -&gt; EndPaint

Creating GDI objects that are never destroyed is probably the most common cause
of lost system resources. A careful examination of every place in the
application's code that uses GDI objects will often reveal the problem.

The debugging version of Windows 3.1 will FatalExit when an application
terminates if a GDI object owned by the application has not been deleted.

The USER Heap
-------------

When an application creates window classes, windows, and menus, these objects
take up room in the USER heap. When an application terminates, Windows usually
reclaims the memory used by objects in the USER heap.

Menus are a notable exception to this rule. Windows destroys the current menu of
a window that is being destroyed. Windows does not destroy menus if they are not
the current menu for any window. This can cause problems for applications that
switch between multiple menus: the "extra" menus are not automatically destroyed
when the application terminates.

Therefore, if an application uses multiple menus, perform the following steps:

1. Keep the handle to each menu.

2. When the application is terminating, use the GetMenu function to discover
  which menu is currently being used. Do not call the DestroyMenu function on
  this menu, Windows will destroy it automatically.

3. Call the DestroyMenu function to destroy each of the other menus. This will
  reclaim the memory in the USER heap that these menus were using.

Because the USER heap is a shared system resource, it is important that an
application does not allocate too many USER objects at once. If the USER heap
becomes too full, subsequent calls to the RegisterClass and CreateWindow
functions will fail.

This means that an application cannot create an excessively large number of
windows. Also, when calling the RegisterClass functions, make sure that the
cbWndExtra and cbClassExtra fields of the WNDCLASS structure are explicitly set
to 0 (zero) if no extra bytes are needed.

Also, the following calls should always be matched:

     CreateIcon   -&gt; DestroyIcon
     CreateCursor -&gt; DestroyCursor

Troubleshooting and Heap Walker
-------------------------------

As mentioned above, Program Manager's Free Systems Resources value can provide
evidence that memory objects are not being reclaimed in the USER or GDI heaps.

It is sometimes unclear whether or not a particular Windows API call that creates
an object must be balanced by a later call to explicitly delete the object. The
following is a simple test that can be performed to find out:

1. Alter the Generic sample application to ensure that it contains a loop that
  makes the API call in question 50 times, creating 50 of the objects in
  question.

2. Run this version of Generic repeatedly. If the Program Manager's Free System
  Resources value goes down every time Generic runs and exits, a balancing API
  call must be made to reclaim the system resources before Generic terminates.

The most powerful tool for looking at problems with lost system resources is the
Heap Walker application. Heap Walker is included with the Microsoft Windows
Software Development Kit (SDK). Chapter 11 of the "Microsoft Windows Software
Development Kit Tools" guide explains how to use Heap Walker. In particular,
page 11-8 outlines the procedure for checking for leftover GDI objects.
