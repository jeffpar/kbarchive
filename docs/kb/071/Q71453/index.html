  The Wacom menu will appear with three choices:

  FUNC SET -- Main settings menu
  JAP/ENG -- Japanese or English menus

2. Choose FUNC SET. Another menu appears:

  TABLET | VIDEO | BACK LIGHT | MACRO | MAINTENANCE

3. Choose the TABLET menu and modify each of the parameters as follows:

  COMM = "WACOMHD" (without the quotation marks)
  FORMAT = "BIN" (without the quotation marks)
  MODE = "STREAM" (without the quotation marks)
  COORD = "ABS" (without the quotation marks)
  ALWAYS = "DSB" (without the quotation marks)
  BAUDRATE = "19200" (without the quotation marks)
  PARITY = "NONE" (without the quotation marks)
  STOP BIT = "1" (without the quotation marks)

  MM/INCH = "INCH" (without the quotation marks)
  BUZZER = "OFF" (without the quotation marks)
  ORIGIN = "UPPER LEFT" (without the quotation marks)
  DSR = "DSB" (without the quotation marks)

4. Choose the VIDEO menu and modify each of the parameters as follows:

  RGB SIGNAL = "G (disregard R and B)" (without the quotation marks)
  DISPLAY MODE = "POS" (without the quotation marks)
  MODEL = "PS/2" (without the quotation marks)

5. Choose the BACK LIGHT menu and modify each of the parameters as follows:

  AUTO LIGHT OFF TIME = "5min" (without the quotation marks)
  BRIGHT ON LIGHT OFF = "10%" (without the quotation marks)

6. Choose the MAINTENANCE menu and modify each of the parameters as follows:

  HORIZON = "45" (without the quotation marks)
  VERTICAL = "33" (without the quotation marks)
  PLL.CNT = "94" (without the quotation marks)
  DOTDLCOK = "DOWN" (without the quotation marks)
  ANALOG RGB LEVEL
  R = "18" (without the quotation marks)
  G = "18" (without the quotation marks)

After making these changes, if the video output is not satisfactory, modify the
parameters on the VIDEO and MAINTENANCE menus to fine tune the output for your
machine.
