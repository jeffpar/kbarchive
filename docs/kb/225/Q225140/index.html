-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 4.0, 4.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The function COleDateTime::operator=(const time_t&amp; timeSrc) does not
properly handle dates later than December 31, 1999. For example, 02/05/2000 may
be represented as 02/05/100.

This bug can be seen in the Windows 95/Windows 98 diagnostics applet
Msinfo32.exe. If the date on the computer is set to later than December 31,
1999, the dates in the Msinfo32-generated report are not displayed properly.

CAUSE
=====

COleDateTime::operator= calls a helper function in MFC named OleDateFromTm. This
function is used to convert from the CRT time structure, which stores the year
relative to 1900 (for example, 99 = 1999, 100 = 2000) to what the OLE date/time
conversion functions expect. OleDateFromTm assumes that any year that is passed
to it that is less than 100 is an abbreviated date relative to 1900 and adds
1900 to it. If the year is greater than 99 (that is, 100 = 2000) nothing is
added. Therefore, when 100 is passed (for 2000) to OleDateFromTm, nothing is
added to it and the date comes back as 100.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a bug in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

This bug has been fixed in patched versions of the Mfc40.dll and Mfc40u.dll.
Version number is 4.1.6140. These DLLs are included as part of the Y2K updates
for Windows 95 and Windows 98. For Windows NT 4.0, a hot fix is available.
