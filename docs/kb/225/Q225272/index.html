- Microsoft Windows 95

SYMPTOMS
========

During the installation of a German Windows 95 client in a Small Business Server
(SBS) network, the client computer may restart automatically before finishing
the Client Application Setup Wizard. After the restart, the wizard restarts and
may display the following error message.

  Setup cannot be continued, since there is not enough disk space on the drive.
  Please verify the list of the components which can be installed.

NOTE: This behavior occurs only on German localized versions of Windows 95. It
does not occur with Microsoft Windows 98 or Microsoft Windows NT Workstation
clients.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the wizard does not indicate which programs had been
installed before the restart. Therefore, the wizard tries to install all of the
client programs again. If there is not enough disk space to install all the
programs, the wizard cannot continue.


RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this behavior, use the Add Software To The Computer Wizard from
the SBS console and clear the check boxes for all the client programs. When you
log on to the client again, the wizard starts and then shuts down, preventing it
from running at the next restart. You can then install any necessary programs
from the console if there is enough disk space on the client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the German-language version of
Windows 95.
