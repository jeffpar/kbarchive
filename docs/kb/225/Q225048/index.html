SUMMARY
=======

When migrating an application from using DAO and the Jet database engine to
using ADO and the Jet database engine, there are a number of issues that need to
be taken into account before determining the feasibility of such a transition.

MORE INFORMATION
================

DAO and ADO were designed to solve two different problems. As such, they expose
two different object models and different methods of manipulating the underlying
data engines. These differences could mean that you have to make some extensive
changes when migrating your application from DAO to ADO.

The DAO object model is designed specifically for the Microsoft Jet database
engine. Jet itself incorporates ISAM and ODBC connectivity and makes the
back-end providers look as much like the native Jet engine as possible, though
this comes at the expense of performance. DAO also has an ODBCDirect mode that
allows it to host RDO objects and access ODBC datasources in a very efficient
manner.

The ADO object model was designed for OLE DB providers and is a much simpler and
more flexible object model than DAO. However, its architectural design poses
some problems when using the Microsoft Jet OLE DB provider, and it is more
limited than DAO in Jet functionality it supports.

This article outlines several issues you need to consider when making the
decision whether to migrate your applications from DAO to ADO.

Provider: OLE DB Provider for Jet 3.51 vs 4.0
---------------------------------------------

The first decision is which OLE DB provider to use. The OLE DB provider for Jet
3.51 uses the same version of Jet as Access 97 and Visual Basic 5.0 and 6.0, but
it has limited functionality. The OLE DB provider for Jet 4.0 has more
functionality, but its native database format is incompatible with Access 97,
though it can read and write to older database formats through an ISAM driver.

Cursors: Client-Side vs Server-Side
-----------------------------------

The next decision you have to make in ADO, as in ODBC and RDO, is whether to use
client-side cursors or server-side cursors.

If you choose client-side cursors, the Client Cursor engine requests the records
from Microsoft Jet and buffers them in a temporary file on your local machine.
This will allow your application to have standard ADO functionality, such as
disconnected and/or saved recordsets and batch updates. However, you will not be
able to see new records added to any table using an Autonumber column as the
Primary key unless you Requery the records. You will also not be able to see
changes other users make until you requery the recordset.

For more information about this topic, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q190370 PRB: AutoNumber Field Is Not Incremented When Using ADO

The OLE DB Provider for Microsoft Jet 3.51 does not return enough schema
information for some recordsets to be updated when using client-side cursors.

For more information about this topic, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q190108 PRB: Error Updating adUseClient Cursor Based on MDB Query

When using server-side cursors that are provided by the Microsoft Jet OLE DB
provider and Rowset Helper, functionality will be more limited. However,
performance of certain operations, such as scrolling through records in a
recordset, will be faster, and you will be able to see records added to tables
that contain Autonumber fields without having to requery the recordset.

Multiple Providers
------------------

As stated at the beginning of the article, DAO and Jet try to make all providers
appear the same to the programmer. The drawback is performance. The benefit is
fewer special case decisions in code. ADO, however, exposes the native
functionality of each provider. This can mean more efficient programs if they
are coded against a single provider, but if writing code to access multiple
providers, then you will have to use client-side cursors to minimize differences
between them, or you will have to devote more of your application to special
case scenarios where two or more providers expose different functionality.

Limited Functionality of ADO and the OLE DB Provider for Jet
------------------------------------------------------------

The OLE DB Provider for Jet 3.51 is a limited provider. It was intended to
provide a thread-safe method of using Microsoft Jet with Microsoft's Internet
Information Server.

For more information about this topic, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q222135 INFO: Using Microsoft Jet with IIS

It does not expose the full capabilities of the Microsoft Jet database engine. It
provides the ability to open recordsets against tables, non-parameterized
queries, and parameterized or non-parameterized SELECT statements. It also
allows the execution of SQL commands, but not stored Microsoft Jet action
queries. It does not allow access to ISAM data sources.

The OLE DB Provider for Jet 4.0 exposes most of the Microsoft Jet functionality,
but not all of it. In addition to the ADO type library, you must include
references in your project to the ADOX and Jet and Replication Objects type
libraries to take advantage of functionality outside the core ADO objects. This
mainly falls into the category of manipulating Access-specific objects and some
of the other issues noted below.

Limited Functionality of DAO
----------------------------

- DAO 3.51 cannot use the Microsoft Jet 4.0 database engine, but it does have
  full control over the Microsoft Jet 3.51 database engine.

- DAO 3.6 provides DAO 3.51 level of control over Microsoft Jet 4.0, but does
  not expose any new functionality available in Microsoft Jet 4.0.

Performance
-----------

DAO makes much more efficient use to the Microsoft Jet database engine than ADO
and many operations are faster under DAO, sometimes up to 5 or 10 times faster,
such as use of Batch updates. Another issue is that the calls made to retrieve
schema information are inefficient when applied against Jet. This results in
queries and updates against tables with a large number of columns being 30
percent to 80 percent slower than the equivalent query using DAO. One example of
inefficient usage of Jet by ADO is illustrated in the next section on Connection
Issues.


Connection Issues
-----------------

Microsoft Jet can host multiple independent sessions within the same process.
Each session has overhead and a separate read cache. A session in DAO is
represented by the DBEngine object. By default, all DAO objects you create and
all DAO Data controls in Visual Basic use the same Jet session.

In OLE DB, a Jet session is represented by the Data Source object. Multiple
connections can be opened against a single Data Source object.

In ADO, the OLE DB object model is somewhat simplified: An ADO Connection object
consists of an OLE DB Data Source object and an OLE DB Connection object. This
means that in ADO, every Connection object and ADO Data control use a separate
Jet session.

This has important ramifications when migrating your application from DAO to ADO.
First, Microsoft Jet can only handle a limited number of sessions. If your
application uses a large number of ADO Data controls, Jet may run out of
resources. In addition, Jet's read buffer has a five-second time-out, so changes
made on one connection will not be visible on another for five seconds. In DAO,
this was not an issue, because all objects were using the same buffer. The
following Knowledge Base article provides more information on this topic, and
how to share connections between data controls to eliminate the problems caused
by multiple Jet sessions:

  Q216925 PRB: Single-User Concurrency Problems With ADO and Jet

A second method of improving concurrency is to use the RefreshCache method of
JetEngine object. This object is exposed via the Microsoft Jet and Replication
Objects 2.1 Library, available starting with ADO 2.1 Sp1 GA. ADO is downloadable
from:

http://www.microsoft.com/data

Redistribution
--------------

When using DAO, you have a much smaller number of files that you must install on
the client machine. The Visual Basic Setup Wizard (Visual Basic 5.0 and earlier)
or the Package and Deployment Wizard (Visual Basic 6.0) handles this for you.
With ADO, you have to redistribute all of ADO and OLE DB, including ODBC, and
some default drivers other than Microsoft Jet.

Wild Card Characters
--------------------

The query wild-card characters are different in DAO than in ADO. DAO exposes the
following characters for use with the SQL LIKE operator:

+---------------------------------------------------+
| Character | Function                              | 
+---------------------------------------------------+
| *         | Match any string                      | 
+---------------------------------------------------+
| ?         | Match any character                   | 
+---------------------------------------------------+
| #         | Match any digit                       | 
+---------------------------------------------------+
| [a-cf]    | Match any of 'a' through 'c' or 'f'   | 
+---------------------------------------------------+
| [~a-c]    | Match anything but of 'a' through 'c' | 
+---------------------------------------------------+

ADO exposes the following ANSI wildcard characters:

+---------------------------------+
| Character | Function            | 
+---------------------------------+
| %         | Match any string    | 
+---------------------------------+
| _         | Match any character | 
+---------------------------------+

Wildcards and Stored Queries
----------------------------

If you have a stored QueryDef in an MDB file, created through Access or DAO, that
uses wildcard characters, it will not return any records if run under ADO. The
OLEDB provider for Jet recompiles the SQL and tells the query engine to use the
ANSI wildcard characters (see table above).

If you create a QueryDef in a Jet 4.0 database using the ADO CREATE PROCEDURE or
CREATE VIEW statements and ANSI wildcards, the queries will not run correctly
under DAO 3.6. More information on ANSI query issues is in the "Access 2000 and
Legacy Application Compatibility" section later in this article.

Find vs FindFirst
-----------------

In ADO, the Find method has a couple of limitations:

- Neither the 3.51 nor 4.0 versions of the OLE DB provider for Microsoft Jet
  implement the Find method natively, so the Rowset Helper is used. The Rowset
  Helper implements the Find method by stepping through the records
  sequentially. To avoid this performance penalty, you should use a SELECT
  statement with a WHERE condition to return just the record(s) you need and,
  if this is not feasible, then use client-side cursors and the Filter method.
- Unlike FindFirst or the ADO Filter method, which allow complex search
  criteria, the Find method allows only a single comparison with limited
  syntax:

  fieldname operator literal

OLE Container Control
---------------------

Many databases, including the SQL Server 7 Northwind database, contain pictures
and other objects saved by Microsoft Access. In Visual Basic, you can see the
pictures by binding the OLE Container control to the DAO Data control. However,
the OLE Container control is not compatible with the ADO Data control and there
is no way to access these pictures and display them using ADO. The OLE Container
control cannot be used unbound because GetChunk does not retrieve the data in a
format compatible with the ReadFromFile method.

Security
--------

When using ADOX to create users in a secure Jet environment, you cannot specify
the PID. This means that if the SYSTEM.MDW file is deleted you will not be able
to recreate the accounts from scratch, but must rely on a backup SYSTEM.MDW
file.

Access 2000 and Legacy Application Compatibility
------------------------------------------------

There are three main compatibility issues:

- The first is that using the Jet 4.0 database format means that legacy
  applications, such as Access 95 and Access 97, and Visual Basic 4.0, 5.0, and
  6.0 applications that use the DAO Data control, are all hard-coded to use the
  Jet 3.x database format will not be able read Jet 4.0 data.

- The second issue is that stored queries created by ADO are not visible to
  Access 2000. The reason for this is a change in the Jet 4.0 query processor
  to make it more ANSI compliant, including adding new SQL commands. Access
  2000 does not even display these queries in order to avoid confusing users.
  However, they can be seen and executed via DAO and ADO. They can also be
  referenced in Form and Report RecordSource properties and in SQL statements;
  you will have to type the name in manually as the builder will not display
  the name. The Microsoft OLE DB provider for Jet 4.0 always sets the ANSI flag
  to a non-NULL value. DAO always sets this flag to NULL.

- The third issue is that Jet 4.0 drops support for the FoxPro IISAM. Any
  FoxPro tables must be accessed through the FoxPro ODBC driver. If your Jet
  database uses linked FoxPro tables, and you convert to Jet 4.0, you will have
  to re-link them to use the FoxPro ODBC driver instead.
