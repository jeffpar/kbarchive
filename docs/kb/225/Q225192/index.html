IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade a Systems Management Server (SMS) version 1.2 client to the SMS
version 2.0 client, the client installation process automatically removes the
SMS 1.2 client from both the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive and the HKEY_CURRENT_USER
hive in the registry, and then installs the new SMS 2.0 client entries into the
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive.

However, if there are two or more SMS 1.2 client users sharing the computer with
their own (possibly roaming) profiles, when the second user logs on, the second
user has the SMS 2.0 client installed on the computer under the
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive, but still has the SMS 1.2 registry entries in
HKEY_CURRENT_USER.

WORKAROUND
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Although this situation may not cause an actual problem, it is best to avoid it.
You can either manually remove the redundant registry entry, or possibly create
an advertisement for a package to use a utility such as Regini.exe to remove the
entry. Use Regedit.exe to remove the Smsrun32.exe string value from the Load
value in the following key:

  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows

Additional query words: prodsms deinstall deinstalls uninstall uninstalls
