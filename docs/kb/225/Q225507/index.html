SYMPTOMS
========

After enabling Hardware Inventory on Systems Management Server with clients that
have multiple network providers, the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI)
service may exhibit high processor usage, which can substantially affect
performance of the client system.

You may also see large temporary inventory files in the \Ms\Sms\Clicomp\Hinv
folder on the client computer.

Upon examining the hardware inventory agent log (%windir%\Ms\Sms\Logs\Hinv32.log)
it is observed that the agent times out while attempting to enumerate the
Win32_NetworkClient class:

  ...

  CLASS - Process Class: Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration  	Hardware Inventory Agent	4/2/99 12:01:35 AM	182 (0xB6)	
  CLASS - Process Class: Win32_NetworkClient  	Hardware Inventory Agent	4/2/99 12:01:36 AM	182 (0xB6)	
  INSTANCE WARNING - Enumeration Timeout  	Hardware Inventory Agent	4/2/99 1:01:37 AM	182 (0xB6)	
  CLASS - Process Class: Win32_OperatingSystem  	Hardware Inventory Agent	4/2/99 1:01:37 AM	182 (0xB6)	
  ...

When the Systems Management Server 2.0 client runs hardware inventory and uses
the CPU for a long period of time, the computer will appear to have stopped
responding and/or will send up a huge badmif. The enumeration of the
Win32_NetworkClient class can be disabled by modifying the Sms_def.mof file. To
prevent this problem, set reporting for the Win32_NetworkClient class to false
in the site's Sms_def.mof file. For more information on the procedure to do
this, please refer to Chapter 10 of the Systems Management Server
Administrator's Guide.


CAUSE
=====

The hardware inventory agent uses the Sms_def.mof file to determine which
classes it will attempt to enumerate from WMI. When enumerating the
Win32_NetworkClient class from WMI, the Windows Management service processor
usage raises substantially and continues to maintain high usage. WMI never
returns the requested values for the Win32_NetworkClient class back to the
hardware inventory agent, which then will time out one hour after making the
request to WMI and logs the error indicated above. This problem is typically
caused because the hinv process gets hung up trying to detect a third-party
network redirector, such as Novell Intranetware client, IBM Client Access
client, or Hummingbird client and Lanworks client.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server 2.0. For additional information, click the following article number to
view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Systems Management Server 2.0.
This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack
Service Pack 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use the following registry key to determine which providers and how many
providers are installed on a given computer:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Lanmanworkstation\Networkprovider

NOTE: Client computers running Windows 95 or Windows 98 continually run WinMgmt
to be accessible remotely. This is not the case with Windows NT clients, where
the WinMgmt service is set to Manual and is started on demand (for example, when
hardware inventory is started or when WMI is accessed remotely).

Additional query words: prodsms winmgmt hang hung hangs freeze lock up win9x win95 win98 winnt hinv
