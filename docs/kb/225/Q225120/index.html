SYMPTOMS
========

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry.
Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you
understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information
about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following
article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

When using the Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW) to deploy an Internet
Information Server (IIS) application to a Web server, you may receive the
following error:

  Unexpected error number C0042116 has occurred: The Web server returned the
  following error: The signature on cabinet file XX.CAB could not be verified.

CAUSE
=====

The PDW uses the Posting Acceptor on the remote Web server to post and unpack
the .cab file. After the file has been posted, a registry key is automatically
checked to determine whether the signature on the .cab file must be verified. If
this key is set to Yes, the error message results.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To Resolve the PDW Problem
--------------------------

1. Start the Registry Editor (Regedit.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Publishing\RemoteInstaller

3. Double-click the ComponentRequireSignature value below the RemoteInstaller
  key.

4. Change the value data to No and click OK.

5. Quit the Registry Editor.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
