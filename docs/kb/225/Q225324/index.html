-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If clients try to connect to a server and are configured to use a node type
other than B-Node name resolution (for example, H-,M-, or P-Node), they can no
longer connect to the server and the following error message is displayed:

  Network Path Not found

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the server replies to a name query from the client
with a group name response instead of a unique name response. Without the hotfix
below, the NetBT client only allows a connection attempt to a group name to
occur if it is configured as a B-Node client.

Note that this problem only affects connections to servers that reply to name
queries with a group name, rather than a unique name response. At present, no
server implementations supplied by Microsoft reply with group names. Only
third-party server implementations are likely to be affected by this problem.

RESOLUTION
==========

individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This new version of Netbt.sys allows connection to the first name returned in a
group name response regardless of the node type. It does not attempt to connect
to any other names that may be returned in the group name response.
