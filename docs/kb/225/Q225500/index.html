-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When using CDO to find entries in a large Exchange Server global address list
(GAL) using the property CdoPR_MHS_COMMON_NAME, the operation can take a long
time to complete. The CdoPR_MHS_COMMON_NAME property is sometimes referred to as
the "alias" or "mailbox" name.

Consider the following Visual Basic code-fragment:
(Assume that the MAPI session is already established, and that NameToSearch
contains a string name).

  Dim objSession As MAPI.Session
  Dim objAddrEntFilt As MAPI.AddressEntryFilter
  Dim objAddressEntries As MAPI.AddressEntries
  Dim objAddressEntry As MAPI.AddressEntry

  Set objAddressEntries = objSession.AddressLists("Global Address List").AddressEntries
      
  objAddrEntFilt.Fields.Add (CdoPR_MHS_COMMON_NAME), NameToSearch
          
  Set objAddressEntry = objAddressEntries.GetFirst

The objAddressEntries.GetFirst method may take a long time to execute based on
the size of the global address list.

CAUSE
=====

With respect to the AddressEntryFilter object, the platform SDK currently
documents the following:

  For fields of data type String, the restriction type is RES_CONTENT with
  fuzzy level options FL_SUBSTRING, FL_IGNORECASE, and FL_LOOSE. However, the
  following MAPI properties are compared using FL_PREFIX instead of
  FL_SUBSTRING:

  PR_ACCOUNT
  PR_BUSINESS_ADDRESS_CITY
  PR_COMPANY_NAME
  PR_DEPARTMENT_NAME
  PR_DISPLAY_NAME
  PR_GIVEN_NAME
  PR_OFFICE_LOCATION
  PR_SURNAME
  PR_TITLE

Because CdoPR_MHS_COMMON_NAME (PR_MHS_COMMON_NAME) is not listed, a search
(restriction) using this MAPI property will result in a restriction type of
RES_CONTENT with the fuzzy level options FL_SUBSTRING, FL_IGNORECASE, and
FL_LOOSE. These fuzzy level options result in an inefficient (wildcard type of)
search mechanism, and it is recommended that searches for MAPI properties not
using FL_PREFIX be avoided.

RESOLUTION
==========

A modification was made to Cdo.dll to treat PR_MHS_COMMON_NAME as it does
PR_ACCOUNT (and the other MAPI properties listed above) which results in an
efficient FL_PREFIX search.

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Cdo.dll

+------------------------+
| File name | Version    | 
+------------------------+
| Cdo.dll   | 5.5.2580.0 | 
+------------------------+


WORKAROUND
==========

Extended MAPI could be used instead of Cdo.dll providing more control for the
creation of restrictions.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 3.
