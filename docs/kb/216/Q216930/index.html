SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to use the Update Device Driver wizard to update a driver and you
click Other Locations to browse to a folder, you may be unable to click OK, or
you may receive the following error message:

  The selected location does not contain an updated driver for your device.

  To continue using your current driver, click Finish. To search for an updated
  driver manually, click Other Locations. Or to begin the automatic search
  again, click Back.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if you are trying to browse to an updated driver file
that is located in the root folder of your local hard disk, or the root folder
of a mapped network drive. Note that this behavior does not occur if the file is
in the root folder of drive C.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this problem, move the updated driver files from the root folder
to a different folder, or the root folder of drive C before you try to use the
Update Device Driver wizard.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

This problem is resolved in Microsoft Windows 98.
