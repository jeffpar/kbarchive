-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Outlook 2000 
- Microsoft Outlook 97 
- Microsoft Outlook 98 
- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When a user plans a meeting by using Microsoft Outlook, some attendees may not
display the same amount of free/busy calendar information as their clients are
configured to publish.

CAUSE
=====

This may happen after a user makes a change to an account's calendar, and that
user is set to publish a different number of months of free/busy information.
The client publishes the same number of months of free/busy information as the
client that makes the change is set for.

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the "Steps to Reproduce the Problem" in the "More Information" section of
this article to change User1 to publish 12 months (or match Resource1's setting)
free/busy information, open Resource1's calendar, and manually make a change in
an existing calendar item. Quit and log off Outlook. Resource1 publishes the
amount of free/busy information as set by User1.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce the Problem
------------------------------

1. In Outlook 98, set the number of months of free/busy information to publish
  in; on the Tools menu, click Options, click Calendar Options, and then click
  Freebusy Options. Type the number of months in the Publish box.

  - or -

  In Outlook 97, set the number of months of free/busy information to publish;
  on the Tools menu, click Options, and then click the Calendar tab. Click
  Advanced Scheduling, and then, under "Settings for free/busy information", in
  the Publish box, enter the number of months.

2. Set up two accounts, Resource1 and User1. Set Resource1 to publish 12 months
  of free/busy information, and set User1 to publish 2 months of free/busy
  information. Grant User1 Editor permissions to the Resource1 calendar.

3. Create an appointment in the Resource1 calendar that is set to recur for 52
  weeks. Quit and log off the Resource1 mailbox.

4. Log on as User1 and plan a meeting with Resource1. You see the recurring
  appointment far out into the future.

5. Now open the Resource1 calendar. On the File menu, click Open Other User's
  Folder, and manually enter an appointment or meeting. Close the Resource1
  calendar. Quit and log off User1 from Outlook.

6. Log back on to Outlook as User1 and plan a meeting with Resource1.

Expected results:

You see free/busy information for Resource1 far out into the future, as in step
3.

Actual results:

You only see free/busy information for Resource1 for two months (or whatever
User1 is set to publish).
