-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Schedule+, version 7.5, Danish version 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Appointments between the last Sunday in September and the last Sunday in October
may appear one hour off from the expected time. This occurs in specific time
zones that have changed the transition dates for entering and leaving Daylight
Savings Time.

The same symptoms can occur during the period from the first Sunday in March to
the last Sunday in March.

CAUSE
=====

Schedule+ uses an internal table to store transition times for each individual
time zone. When a governing body decides to change transition dates, the tables
no longer agree with the dates observed in the time zone.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server version 5.0 service pack that contains
this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.
