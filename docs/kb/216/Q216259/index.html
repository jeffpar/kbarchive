SYMPTOMS
========

During normal operation of the Microsoft Exchange Information store, users may
report that response to client operations is very slow or results in a "Client
Operation Failed" error message. Reviewing the Windows NT Event Viewer
Application log, the following event IDs will be generated in succession:

  Event ID: 1160
  Source: MSExchangeIS
  Type: Error
  Category: General
  Description: Database resource failure error Out of memory occurred in
  function 'JTAB_BASE::EcCreateIndex' while accessing the database.

NOTE: The string enclosed in single quotes above may differ in some events.
However, the description will always read Out of memory.

If the store is left in this state for a long period of time, the Information
Store (Store.exe) may terminate unexpectedly with an RPC exception. If the
correct Windows NT and Exchange Server debug symbols are installed, the
resulting Dr. Watson log may display a stack dump similar to the following:

FramePtr  RetAddr   Param1   Param2   Param3   Function Name
4c41f498  77e20f68  0000000e 2cf93cf0 4a4a7a10 RPCRT4!RpcRaiseException

8d31454b  00000000  00000000 00000000 00000000 0x09000802

NOTE: The item to look for in the resulting Dr. Watson log or User.dmp file is
the first parameter to the RPCRT4!RpcRaiseException call, it will be 0x0000000e.
This maps to a decimal value of 14 which then maps to the error: "Not enough
storage is available to complete this operation". The rest of the call stack may
vary.

CAUSE
=====

Any logon operation to the Information Store process results in initialization
of a Windows NT critical section and any logoff operation will result in the
de-initialization (or deletion of the critical section). A critical section
reserves virtual memory when it is initialized and releases it when deleted.

A problem in a post-Service Pack 1 hotfix to Store.exe (starting with builds
2365.0 through build 2448.7) introduced a leak in critical sections that results
in the Store process eventually using up all 2 GB of virtual address space
available to a user-mode process. With no virtual memory available, operations
between the Information Store and Exchange Database Engine will fail, as seen by
the Event ID 1160 error in the Windows NT Application log.

This leak would occur for every logon operation to the Information Store. Servers
that have a high number of POP3 or IMAP clients would encounter this problem
more often because every connection to the server would require a logon
operation and therefore, leak a critical section.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For more information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Information Store

+------------------------+
| File name | Version    | 
+------------------------+
| Store.exe | 5.5.2448.8 | 
+------------------------+



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 2.
