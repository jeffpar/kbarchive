SYMPTOMS
========

Exchange Server 5.5 may not function properly on DEC Alpha EV6 (21264)
computers. In particular, Exchange Server may stop responding (hang) or
experience performance problems. Note that this problem does not occur on
earlier DEC Alpha computers, including the EV4 (21064), EV5 (21164), and EV5.6
(21164A).

CAUSE
=====

Certain operations performed by the Ese.dll dynamic-link library (DLL) file do
not completely conform to the DEC Alpha architecture specification.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Exchange Database Engine

+------------------------+
| File name | Version    | 
+------------------------+
| Ese.dll   | 5.5.2545.0 |

(Alpha) and Psp2esei.exe (x86):

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/exchange/exchange-public/fixes/Eng/Exchg5.5/PostSP2/ESE-fix/


STATUS

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 3.
