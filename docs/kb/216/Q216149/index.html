IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

The installation of Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) presents special
challenges when installing on Terminal Server. Also, as the Terminal Service
Licensing service uses Open Database Connectivity (ODBC), an incorrect
installation of MDAC renders the service inoperable.

Both programs and system services use ODBC, and some manual steps may have to be
used to ensure that nonprivileged services can access the components.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

The first set of steps is necessary to ensure the MDAC service installation will
finish. The last steps will ensure that MDAC will run on the terminal server and
all users will be able to take advantage of the updates.

NOTE: The person performing the installation must be in the local Administrators
group.

1. Stop all ODBC-dependant services including, but not limited to, Internet
  Information Services (IIS), Structure Query Language (SQL) Server, SQL Server
  Enterprise Manager, Terminal Server (TS) licensing service, and ODBC
  Administrator itself, and so on.

2. Remove all users who are logged on.

3. Create a temporary folder in the System32 folder named "Oldodbc" (or any
  folder not in the computer's path), and then move the following files into
  that folder:

  Ds16gt.dll
  Ds32gt.dll
  Odbc16gt.dll
  Odbc32.dll
  Odbc32gt.dll
  Odbcad32.exe
  Odbcconf.dll
  Odbcconf.exe
  Odbccp32.cpl
  Odbccp32.dll
  Odbccr32.dll
  Odbcinst.cnt
  Odbcinst.hlp
  Odbcint.dll

If a webdata package has ever been installed, then all values need to be removed
under the following registry key. Do not remove the key. Save the key to a file
before removing the values.

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Setup\ExceptionComponents


4. At a command prompt, type "change user /install" (without the quotation
  marks), and then close the command window.

5. Now you are ready to start the installation. Download MDAC from the following
  Microsoft Web site and install it with the "complete" option:

  http://www.microsoft.com/data

IMPORTANT: Before closing the Setup screen or restarting, you must run the
program compatibility script, Odbc.cmd, which is located in the following
folder:

  &lt;SystemRoot&gt;\Application Compatibility Scripts\Install

6. Shutdown and restart the computer. This will automatically return the
  computer to Execute mode.

NOTE: Once you have verified that MDAC has installed properly, you may delete the
folder created in Step 3 and all of its contents.

Access to some components located in &lt;Systemroot&gt;\System32 is limited to
the person who performed the installation, the Administrator group, and System.
The generic Everyone group needs Read and Execute rights to the following ODBC
files. The current rights on these files will vary depending on the version of
MDAC that is installed.

  Msvcirt.dll
  Msvcrt.dll
  Odbc32.dll
  Odbc32gt.dll
  Odbccp32.cpl
  Odbccp32.dll
  Odbccr32.dll
  Odbccu32.dll
  Odbcint.dll
  Odbcjet.*
  Odbcji32.dll
  Odbcjt32.dll
  Odbctl32.dll

NOTE: If you are installing MDAC 2.6 and higher, the Jet 4.0 database also needs
to be installed for Terminal Server to operate properly. This is a separate
installation from MDAC. This is not needed for MDAC 2.6 or earlier. You can
download the Jet 4.0 Service Pack 3 Release from the following Microsoft Web
site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/data/download.htm#Jet4SP3info
