-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft BackOffice Small Business Server versions 4.0, 4.0a 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You see either of the following symptoms:

1. When you attempt to manage network users through the Manage Server Console on
  the Small Business Server (SBS) computer, the User List is empty.

2. When you attempt to manage network users through the Remote Manage Server
  Console utility (REMOTECSL) for Windows NT Workstation, the User List is
  empty.

NOTE: In either case, however, when you click Add a New User and then click
Cancel, the list is then populated with the user accounts.

CAUSE
=====

The symptoms on the Small Business Server result from the installation of the
Windows NT Option Pack without applying the BackOffice Update utility.

The symptoms on the Windows NT Workstation computer result from a required
console file not having been updated. The updated file is included in the
BackOffice Update utility.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve the problem, do the following:

1. Running the BackOffice Update utility (Boupdate.exe) on the server re-creates
  the necessary dependancies required in order for the Manage Server Console to
  operate properly with Microsoft Internet Information Server 4.0 (included in
  the Windows NT Option Pack).

  NOTE: To obtain Boupdate.exe, contact Microsoft Product Support Services. For
  a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
  information on support costs, please go to the following address on the World
  Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS


2. To fix the Remote Console utility on the Windows NT Workstation computer, do
  the following:


  1. Click Start, click Programs, and then click Command Prompt.

  2. At the command prompt, type "mkdir boupdate" (without the quotation
     marks).

  3. Insert a floppy disk containing boupdate.exe into the floppy disk drive.

  4. At the command prompt, type "copy a:\boupdate.exe c:\boupdate" (without
     the quotation marks).

     NOTE: This assumes that the floppy disk drive is drive A and the local
     drive is drive C.

  5. At the command prompt, type "cd boupdate" (without the quotation marks).

  6. At the command prompt, type "boupdate.exe /c" (without the quotation
     marks).

  7. A dialog box will appear asking for a location to which to copy the files.
     Type "c:\boupdate" (without the quotation marks) in the text box, or you
     can browse to the directory by using the Browse button.

  8. Click OK. The files are then extracted to c:\boupdate.

  9. At the command prompt, type the following: "copy saminfo1.ocx
     c:\smallbusiness" (without the quotation marks).

     NOTE: This assumes that the installation of SBS was done on drive C.

  10. At the command prompt, type "regsvr32 c:\smallbusiness\saminfo1.ocx"
     (without the quotation marks).

  11. Click OK to close the dialog box stating that the file has been
     successfully registered.

  12. The c:\boupdate folder and its contents can now be deleted.
