The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you connect through a terminal server client to view or modify the audit
properties of a directory on a member server or workstation, you receive the
following error message:

  A required privilege is not held by the client.

This error can occur even if the account you are using is a member of the Domain
Admins global group in the master domain or a resource domain.

CAUSE
=====

The account does not have necessary rights on the terminal server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, make the user a member of the local Administrators group
on the terminal server and the member server/workstation where the user will be
configuring the auditing changes.

As a more secure solution, you could simply grant the user the right to "Manage
auditing and security log" on the two computers. The user will then be able to
manage auditing on a member server/workstation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This is the same error message that a user will receive if he or she tries to
manage auditing directly on a computer to which he or she has not been granted
the "Manage auditing and security log" right.
