MORE INFORMATION

DirectX 6.1 is composed of the following six components:

- Direct3D (used for 3-dimensional rendering)
- DirectPlay (used for multi-player gaming)
- DirectDraw (used for screen graphics)
- DirectSound (used for audio playback)
- DirectInput (used for input device support)
- DirectMusic (used for message-based musical data)

The following new features are included in DirectX 6.1:

DirectMusic
-----------

- Several new DirectMusic components.

DirectDraw
----------

- Enables AGP Command Buffers.

- ModeX fixed for AGP computers.

Direct3D
--------

- Improved performance of DX5 RAMP rasterizer.

- Improved support for video memory vertex buffers.

- Improved support for PowerVR usage of Clear2.

- Drivers implementing ValidateDevice can now consider texture format if
  required.

- Multitexture stage counting is now more accurate.

- Directional and Spot light types now operate correctly on Pentium II
  computers.

- Ramp rasterizer now uses blue channel for gray-scale instead of averaging.
  This is for compatibility with earlier releases.

- Vertex fog now works with SPECULARENABLE set to false.

- 16-Bit ramp rasterizer now supports COPY mode.

- New cap bit for textures which are not powers of two.

DirectPlay
----------

- The serial service provider could attempt to send multiple blocks of data
  simultaneously, which could cause the connection to be lost. Now access is
  serialized.

- If a client was dropped from a session ungracefully and someone else tried to
  join the game before the host timed out that player, all subsequent joins
  would fail. Now joins succeed again once the host completely times out all
  players.

DirectInput
-----------

No new DirectInput features are included in DirectX 6.1.

DirectSound
-----------

No new DirectSound features are included in DirectX 6.1
