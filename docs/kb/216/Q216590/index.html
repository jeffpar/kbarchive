-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.11, 2.11SP1, 2.11SP2, 3.0, 3.0SP1, 3.0SP2, 3.0SP3, 4.0, 4.0SP1, 4.0SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When the Attachmate Advanced Function Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC)
adapter is used to connect the SNA Server computer to a multidrop leased line,
Request to Send (RTS) may be held high, causing other devices connected to the
line to drop.

If one of the other devices on the multidrop line happens to be another SNA
Server computer and it loses its connection, an Event 23, Outage code 0084, may
be logged in the Windows NT Application Event log. The outage code indicates
that the SNA Server computer is not receiving Receiver Ready (RR) poll responses
from the remote system, causing the connection to timeout.

CAUSE
=====

When RTS is held high, a point-to-point connection is created, and other devices
on the multidrop line cannot send data on the line.

For more information about configuring an SDLC connection with an SNA Server
computer using a multidrop line, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q123832 Using SNA Server with SDLC Multidrop Leased Lines

RESOLUTION
==========

Contact Attachmate to obtain the latest Advanced Function adapter drivers that
include the fix for this problem.


MORE INFORMATION
================

To verify that RTS is being held high, check the RTS light on the modem or
CSU/DSU when the connection is started on the SNA Server computer. If the RTS
light is solid (as opposed to flashing), then RTS is being held high. The Modem
Monitor utility that ships with SNA Server can also be used to check RTS. This
utility can be run from the Tools menu in SNA Manager.
