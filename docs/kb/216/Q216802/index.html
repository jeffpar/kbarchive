  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to administer the Proxy Server 1.0 or 2.0 services through the
Internet Services Manager, the following services are missing:

- Web Proxy

- Winsock Proxy

- Socks Proxy (only for Proxy 2.0)

CAUSE
=====

This problem can be caused by any of the following:

- Proxy Server 1.0 or 2.0 has been removed from the server.

- The services have become unbound from the Internet Services Manager because
  of missing entries in the registry.

- Internet Information Server was uninstalled and reinstalled since Proxy
  Server was last installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following solutions can be used to repair the Proxy Server installation.

Option 1
--------

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Run either Regedit.exe or Regedt32.exe.

2. Open the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\INetMgr\Parameters\AddOnServices

3. If there is no listing for Web Proxy, WinSock Proxy, or Socks Proxy (only for
  Proxy 2.0), these will need to be manually added:

  a. Create a new string value and label it Web Proxy.

  b. Have the Value Data point to
     &lt;Drive&gt;\Winnt\System32\Inetsrv\W3pcfg.dll

     NOTE: For Small Business Server, the directory will be
     &lt;Drive&gt;\Winnt.sbs\System32\Inetsrv.

  c. Create a new string value and label it WinSock Proxy.

  d. Have the Value Data point to
     &lt;Drive&gt;\Winnt\System32\Inetsrv\Wspcfg.dll

  e. Create a new string value and label it Socks Proxy (only for Proxy 2.0).

  f. Have the Value Data point to
     &lt;Drive&gt;\Winnt\System32\Inetsrv\Sockscfg.dll

Option 2
--------

To reinstall Proxy Server 1.0, perform the following steps:

1. Insert Disc 1 of the Small Business Server 4.0 installation compact discs.

2. Go to the Proxy directory on the root of Disc 1.

3. From the Proxy directory, run Setup.exe.

4. Use the wizard for configuring Proxy Server.

5. When the installation completes, the Internet Services Manager should now
  list the Proxy services.

To reinstall Proxy Server 2.0, perform the following steps:

1. If this is the first time that Proxy 2.0 has been installed, you will need to
  follow the instructions in the following white paper:

  Installing Windows NT Option Pack and Microsoft Proxy Server 2.0 on Microsoft
  BackOffice Small Business Server 4.0a
  (http://www.microsoft.com/backofficesmallbiz/guide/installp.asp)

2. Run the Proxy Pre-Installation Wizard.

3. Insert the Proxy 2.0 installation compact disc.

4. Go to the MSPROXY directory on the root of the compact disc.

5. Run Setup.exe from the MSPROXY directory

6. Use the wizard for configuring Proxy Server.

7. When the installation completes, the Internet Services Manager should now
  list the Proxy services.
