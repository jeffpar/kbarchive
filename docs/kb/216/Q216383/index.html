SYMPTOMS
========

Memory allocations may return "Out of Memory" errors even when there are large
free blocks of memory available within the virtual address space of the process.

CAUSE
=====

Heap allocations within a process may result in the memory manager having to
extend the heap using virtual memory to satisfy the request. The memory manager
extends the heap by allocating contiguous virtual memory from the process
address space. By default, the memory manager requests double the previous
successfully allocated heap segment. If it fails allocating virtual memory for a
larger heap segment, it does not try to allocate a segment the size of the
previous or smaller segments.

For example, if the previous successfully allocated heap segment was 64 MB, the
heap manager will attempt to extend the heap by 128 MB if it needs to extend the
heap. If there is not 128 MB of contiguous virtual memory, the allocation to
extend the heap will fail and the heap allocation will subsequently fail even
though there may have been another 64-MB free block.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
the individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
pack, please go to:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Windows NT version
4.0. This problem was first corrected in Windows NT version 4.0 Service Pack 5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Ntdll was fixed so that, if Ntdll.dll cannot extend the heap because of an "Out
of Memory" error on a first attempt, it divides the requested virtual memory
allocation size by 2 and will continue to attempt to extend the heap in this way
until the size requested falls below what is needed to satify the heap
allocation.
