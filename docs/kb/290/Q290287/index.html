SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to manually uninstall and re-install the Exchange
Server 5.5 version of Microsoft Outlook Web Access (OWA).

MORE INFORMATION
================

To manually uninstall and re-install OWA:

1. Stop and disable all third-party services and programs (for example,
  antivirus or backup software). Stop the World Wide Web Publishing service.

2. If you use any customized Active Server Pages, back up your Webdata folder,
  which contains your custom files.

3. Uninstall OWA:

  a. Insert the Exchange Server 5.5 CD-ROM in the CD-ROM drive, and then locate
     the Setup.exe file in the following location:

  Server\Setup\I386\Setup.exe

  b. Click Install Exchange 5.5.

  c. Click Add/Remove.

  d. Click to clear the Outlook Web Access check box.

  e. Click Yes when you are prompted about whether you want to remove one
     previously installed component.

4. Use the Internet Service Manager in Microsoft Internet Information Server
  (IIS) version 4.0 or Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 to
  delete the Exchange virtual directory if it exists. If a virtual directory
  named Exchange exists, right-click the Exchange virtual directory, and then
  click Delete.

5. Remove the "exchfilt" ISAPI filter from the Web site:

  a. Use the Internet Service Manager to open the properties of the default Web
     site.

  b. Click the ISAPI filter page, click "exchfilt", and then click Remove.

6. Rename the OWA files:

  a. Locate the Winnt\System32 folder.

  b. If Exchfilt.dll exists, rename it to Exchfilt.old.

  c. Rename the Cdo.dll file to Cdo.old.

  d. Locate the Exchsrvr\Bin folder.

  e. Rename the Cdohtml.dll file to Cdohtml.old.

  f. Locate the Exchsrvr folder.

  g. Rename the Webdata folder to Webdata.old.

  h. Rename the Webtemp folder to Webtemp.old.

7. Remove the OWA registry values. To do so, you need to edit the registry.

  WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious
  problems that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft
  cannot guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry
  Editor incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

  To remove the OWA registry values:

  a. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

  b. Locate and click the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services

  c. If the MSExchangeWeb key still exists, delete it.

  d. Locate and click the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Exchange\Setup

  e. If the Web Connector key still exists, delete it.

  f. Locate and click the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID

  g. If the {bc00f780-31ac-11d0-b5f1-00aa00bf3382} key still exists, delete it.

  h. If the {bc00f781-31ac-11d0-b5f1-00aa00bf3382} key still exists, delete it.

  i. If the {bc00f782-31ac-11d0-b5f1-00aa00bf3382} key still exists, delete it.

  j. Locate and click the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib

  k. If the {BC00F700-31AC-11D0-B5F1-00AA00BF3382} key still exists, delete it.

  l. Quit Registry Editor.

8. Remove the Microsoft Transaction Server components (only for Microsoft
  Windows NT 4.0):

  a. In the IIS management console, locate the Microsoft Transaction Server
     tree.

  b. Expand the Computers container.

  c. Expand "My computer".

  d. Expand "Packages installed".

  e. Expand "IIS In-Process Applications"

  f. Expand Components.

  g. Delete all of the occurrences of IISWAM.1_Root_Exchange.

     NOTE: The IISWAM.1 changes if OWA is under another Web site. The
     "_Root_Exchange" remains constant.

9. Stop and restart the IIS Administrator service.

10. Apply the service pack for your operating system again.

11. Re-install OWA:

  a. Insert the Exchange Server 5.5 CD-ROM in the CD-ROM drive, and then locate
     the Setup.exe file in the following location:

  Server\Setup\I386\Setup.exe

  b. Choose a custom installation, and then click to select the Outlook Web
     Access check box.

     IMPORTANT: Make sure that the Microsoft Exchange Server and Microsoft
     Exchange Administrator check boxes are selected. If these check boxes are
     not selected, Exchange Server is removed and the information store is
     lost.

12. Apply the Exchange Server 5.5 service pack again.
