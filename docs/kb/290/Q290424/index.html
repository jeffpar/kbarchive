SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Ixsso.query object to access the catalog you may receive an
error that the application called an interface that was marshalled for a
different thread. The error message that occurs is:

  Error Type Create Record Set 0x8001010E Application called interface that was
  marshalled for a different thread.

CAUSE
=====

This may be caused by problems with the registration of the Ixsso.dll file.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use these steps:

1. On the taskbar, click Start, programs, administrative tools, component
  services

2. In the Component Services dialog box, double-click the Computers folder.
  Expand My Computer, and then expand COM+ Applications. For each entry, expand
  the Components folder. Look in the Components folder and if there is an entry
  for Ixsso.query.2 or Ixsso.util.2, remove them.

3. Close the Component Services dialog box. On the taskbar, click Start, and
  then click Run. In the Run dialog box, type:

  " cmd " (without the quotation marks)

  Click OK.

4. Change the directory to the System32 folder by typing:

  " cd %systemroot%\win32 " (without the quotation marks)

  Press ENTER.

5. Type:

  " regsvr32 /u ixsso.dll " (without the quotation marks)

  Press ENTER.

  You should receive a message that states that the DLL was unregistered
  successfully.

6. Type:

  " regsvr32 ixsso.dll " (without the quotation marks)

  Press ENTER.

  You should receive a message that states that the DLL was registered
  successfully.
