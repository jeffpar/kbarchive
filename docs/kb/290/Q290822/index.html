The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an out-of-process application ends, either because the application crashes
or because you use the mtxstop command, the next request to that application
results in a remote procedure call (RPC) error, as expected. When this occurs,
the RPC service returns an RPC error to Internet Information Server (IIS), which
IIS passes on to the client.

Although one of several RPC errors can occur, the RPC_S_CALL_FAILED error is
usually returned. In this case, IIS traps for that error and cleans up
references to the out-of-process application; thus, subsequent requests for that
application start a new MTX.

However, when the RPC_S_SERVER_UNAVAILABLE error is returned, IIS 4.0 does not
trap for this error; thus, the references are never cleaned up, and a new MTX is
not started. As a result, IIS continuously gives the clients an "RPC Server
unavailable" error until the Web service is restarted.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.
