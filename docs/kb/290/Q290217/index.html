The following topics are covered:

- Page 886: Incorrect Information About Differential Backup

MORE INFORMATION
================

Page 128: Formula To Determine Total CPU Write Time Is Incorrect
----------------------------------------------------------------

On page 128, item 8, the formula for determining the total CPU write time is
incorrect.

Change:
" CPU write time = (writes/sec) * (CPU write time) " (without the quotation
marks)

To:
" total CPU write time = (writes/sec) * (CPU write time) * (work period) "
(without the quotation marks)


Page 149: Incorrect SQL Server 2000 Licensing Information
---------------------------------------------------------

On page 149 in step 17, there is an error in the description of SQL Server 2000
licensing.

The following sentence is incorrect and should be disregarded, per the Microsoft
SQL Server product team:

"You could choose to limit SQL Server to just two of four processors. In that
case you would be required to purchase only two processor licenses."

Other references to SQL Server 2000 licensing in this title are correct.


Page 886: Incorrect Information About Differential Backup
---------------------------------------------------------

On page 886 there is an incorrect statement made about differential backup and
the restoration thereof.

On page 886, under Differential Backups, change:
"Restoring a differential backup requires the restoration of the last full backup
and all differential backups that have occurred since the last full backup."

To:
"Restoring a differential backup requires the restoration of the last full backup
and the last differential backup."


Page 912: Incorrect Information About Differential Backup
---------------------------------------------------------

On page 912 there is an incorrect statement made about differential backup and
the restoration thereof.

On page 912, under Restoring from a Differential Backup, change:
"To restore from a differential backup, you must first restore from a full backup
and then restore all of the differential backups that have been created since
the last full backup. Remember, a differential backup is used to back up
information that has changed since the last full or differential backup."

To:
"To restore from a differential backup, you must first restore from a full backup
and then restore the last differential backup. Remember, a differential backup
is used to back up information that has changed since the last full backup."
