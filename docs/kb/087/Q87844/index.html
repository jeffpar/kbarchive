-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.0, 3.0a, 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

A bitmap (.BMP) file created in Windows Paintbrush does not appear to tile if
the image attributes are not set to the desired size before the image is
created. It is possible, however, to take an image that was incorrectly created
in a full canvas, and make a new image that has the correct image attributes to
be tiled on the Windows desktop.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you attempt to change the image attributes of an existing drawing, nothing
will happen with Windows version 3.0. With Windows version 3.1 you will receive
the following message:

  Resetting image attributes will clear the current image and start a new
  editing session.

  Do you want to start a new session with the new image attributes?

Choosing Yes will start a new session with the desired size (image attributes);
however, the new session will not contain the old loaded image.

Creating a Bitmap Tile Image from Scratch
-----------------------------------------

If you want to create a bitmap image to be tiled on the Windows Desktop:

1. From the Options menu, choose Image Attributes.

2. Select the correct width and height for your tile image.

3. From the File menu, choose New. The image attributes (the drawing area) will
  be the size you specified. The image then will be tiled on the Windows
  Desktop as much as possible, depending upon the ratio of the image attributes
  size, verses the total screen size.

Creating Bitmap Tile Image From a Previously Created Full-Screen Bitmap
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Start Paintbrush.

2. From the File menu, choose Open to open the image in Paintbrush.

3. From the View menu, choose Cursor Position. This will display the x, y
  coordinates of the mouse cursor position from the top-left corner. The
  coordinates in pixels are displayed on the Paintbrush menu bar towards the
  right.

4. Select the Pick tool (scissors with a dotted box over them). Then draw a
  rectangle selecting ONLY the part of the image you want to be your tile
  image.

5. From the Edit menu, choose Copy.

6. You should still have the Pick tool selected. While the Pick tool is the
  active tool, the mouse cursor looks like a large plus sign when the cursor is
  inside the drawing area.

7. There are two possible cases for this next step:

   - The desired tile image is in the top-left corner of the Paintbrush drawing
     region. If this is the case, then put the center of the cursor (the point
     where the lines cross) at the bottom right corner of the rectangular box
     you have drawn around your image to be tiled. Write down the numbers being
     displayed on the menu bar in the upper-left corner for the x, y
     coordinates in pixels.

   - The desired tile image is somewhere in the Paintbrush canvas other then
     the top-left corner. If this is the case, then put the center of the
     cursor (point where the lines cross) at the top-left corner of the
     rectangular box you have drawn around your image and then write down the
     coordinate numbers displayed on the menu bar.

     Next, place the center of the cursor on the bottom-right corner of the
     rectangle, and then write down the numbers displayed on the menu bar.
     Subtract the first pair of numbers from their corresponding second numbers
     you have written down.

8. From the Options menu, choose Image Attributes.

9. Change the Units to pels .

10. Change the numbers for the width and height to match those you determined in
  step 7. Choose OK.

11. You will now have a blank drawing area the size you specified, which should
  match your desired tile bitmap image. From the Edit menu, choose Paste.

12. Save this new image with a filename that is different from the filename of
  the original bitmap image. Make sure the file is saved to the Windows
  directory.

13. Run Control Panel and choose the Desktop icon. Change the Wallpaper
  selection the filename indicated in step 12 and select the Tile option.

14. Exit Control Panel, and you should now have your image tiled on the desktop.
