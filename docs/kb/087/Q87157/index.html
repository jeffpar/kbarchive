SUMMARY
=======

If new mail is created during an offline session in version 3.1 of Microsoft
Mail for the Macintosh, it is stored in the Outbox folder. When a user begins an
online session with their mail server, a dialog box is displayed. The dialog box
advises that there are outgoing messages in the Outbox and asks if the user
wants to send them now. If Yes is selected, the messages are sent immediately
while displaying a status bar. If No is selected, the outgoing queue is not
affected.

If any messages were incorrectly addressed during an offline session, they are
returned by the server as undeliverable.

Additional query words: 3.10
