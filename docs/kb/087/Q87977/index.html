-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

IBM has confirmed that when an IBM AS/400 is used as a file server, Windows will
not recognize the AS/400 folders when Windows or Windows for Workgroups is
running in 386 enhanced mode. However, Windows 3.1 or 3.11 will recognize these
folders when running in standard mode.

CAUSE
=====

According to IBM, the problem is due to the AS/400 device drive ECYDDX.SYS,
which allocates logical drives.

NOTE: This device driver may prevent Windows for Workgroups 3.11 File Manager
from recognizing drive A or B, resulting in the

  drive A: or B: does not exist

error message.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To correct the problem, obtain a Program Temporary Fix (PTF) for the appropriate
version, release, and modification level of ECYDDX.SYS. This information can be
obtained by typing "go licpgm" (without the quotation marks) and choosing Option
10 on the AS/400.

To update the system, obtain one of the following files

- For V2R1M0 use (PTF) SF10163

- For V2R1M1 use (PTF) SF10165

- For Extended DOS use (PTF) SF09768

where V is the version, R is the revision, and M is the modification level.

These corrections may be obtained from IBM by using the ECS Modem connected to
the AS/400. Please contact IBM if you have further questions regarding this
particular problem or how to correct it.

The AS/400 included here is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we
make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
