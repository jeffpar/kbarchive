The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After running the CorelDRAW 3.0 Setup program from the CD-ROM, it may take up to
15 minutes to start WordPerfect for Windows. WordPerfect for Windows may also
start slowly when you select a printer driver in WordPerfect for Windows.

CAUSE
=====

When installing CorelDRAW 3.0 from the CD, it will add approximately 250
TrueType fonts (unless otherwise specified). These fonts are added to any
existing font packages installed, such as the TrueType font pack or the standard
set of Windows 3.1 TrueType fonts.

When WordPerfect is started, it looks for a .WRS printer file. If this file is
not available, it will create one. The .WRS file is also updated whenever the
Windows printer driver settings are changed (including changing paper
orientation, size, source, and the available fonts).

The large number of fonts installed by CorelDRAW are what cause the very long
start time for WordPerfect for Windows. WordPerfect is translating the Windows
3.1 printer driver settings into a format that WordPerfect can use.

Either of the following two workarounds prevent WordPerfect from reading the
fonts in the WIN.INI file, allowing WordPerfect to start normally.

WORKAROUND
==========

Workaround One
--------------

- If the WordPerfect for Windows version date is 11-4-91, make sure the
  following line is added to the [COMPATIBILITY] section of the WIN.INI file:

  Win2wrs=0x01210

- If the WordPerfect for Windows version date is 4-30-92, make sure the above
  line is removed from the [COMPATIBILITY] section of the WIN.INI file. The
  installation program should remove the line from the section.

Workaround Two
--------------

Set the attribute on all .WRS printer files to read-only by using the MS-DOS
Attrib command:

     attrib +r *.wrs

For more information on the maximum number of TrueType fonts, query on the
following words in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
