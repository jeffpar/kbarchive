SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft LAN Manager version 2.1 has been designed to run from a hard disk.
However, it is possible to fit all the required files for an MS-DOS Enhanced
workstation on a 720K 3.5-inch or 1.2 MB 5.25-inch floppy disk. It is not
possible to create an Enhanced workstation boot disk on a 5.25-inch 360K floppy
disk.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The easiest way to build an Enhanced workstation boot disk is to install an
MS-DOS Enhanced workstation on a computer with a hard drive, copy the minimum
files you need onto a bootable floppy disk, and then edit the configuration
files appropriately for the recipient LAN Manager workstation without a hard
drive.

For information on how to create a system disk, see your MS-DOS manual. This
example is for a computer with a 3Com EtherLink II network card and the NetBEUI
protocol. Instructions for editing the AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, LANMAN.INI, and
PROTOCOL.INI files are included at the end of this article. The following files
and directories should be placed on a system disk:

  Directory of A:\ 
  ----------------
  COMMAND.COM      MS-DOS command file
  AUTOEXEC.BAT     MS-DOS configuration file
  CONFIG.SYS       MS-DOS configuration file
  PROTOCOL.INI     LAN Manager configuration file
  LANMAN.INI       LAN Manager configuration file
  PROTMAN.DOS      Protocol Manager
  PROTMAN.EXE      Protocol Manager
  PRO.MSG          Help Messages
  PROH.MSG         Help Messages
  ELNKII.DOS       3Com net card driver
  NETBEUI.EXE      NetBEUI Protocol
  ENCRYPT.EXE      Encrypt service
  MSRV.EXE         Messenger service
  NETPOPUP.EXE     Netpopup service
  CHKNET.EXE       Started with the workstation
  MINSES.EXE       Started with the workstation
  NETWKSTA.EXE     Started with the workstation
  NET.EXE          Used for all Enhanced commands
  NET.MSG          Additional help messages
  LOAD.COM         Binds MAC driver to Protocol
  LOGS &lt;DIR&gt;       Directory for error messages

More information about MS-DOS Enhanced workstation files can be found on page 209
of the "Microsoft LAN Manager Administrator's Reference."

SAMPLE CONFIGURATION FILES
--------------------------

AUTOEXEC.BAT:

PROMPT $P$G
SET PATH=A:\;
NET START WORKSTATION
LOAD NETBEUI

CONFIG.SYS:

lastdrive=z
device=A:\protman.dos /i:A:
device=A:\ELNKII.DOS

LANMAN.INI:

Copy the LANMAN.INI file from an existing LAN Manager 2.1 MS-DOS Enhanced
workstation onto the boot disk. In the [workstation] section, change the
LANROOT= entry from C:\LANMAN.DOS to A:\ and change the COMPUTERNAME= entry. In
the [netshell] section, change the USERNAME= entry if needed. In the [services]
section, change the paths to the correct location for the files listed (relative
to the LANROOT= entry).

[networks]
 netservices = chknet, minses

[workstation]
 wrkservices = messenger,netpopup,encrypt
 computername = *put computername here*
 domain = cavalier
 lanroot = A:\ 
 othdomains =
 numdgrambuf = 3

[netshell]

[NETBEUI_XIF]
 Drivername = netbeui$
 SESSIONS = 6
 NCBS = 12
 BINDINGS = "ELNKII_NIF"

[ELNKII_NIF]

; protocol.ini section for the 3Com Etherlink II Adapter Card

;   The next two lines are defaults, the correct settings for your
;   net card may differ

   IOADDRESS = 0x300
   INTERRUPT = 3
   MAXTRANSMITS = 40
   DRIVERNAME = ELNKII$

;   Add this line if you are using an external transceiver

   transceiver = external
