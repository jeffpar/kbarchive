-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If Windows is set up with a network install (using the SETUP /N command), you
cannot configure an individual copy of MIDI mapper for each workstation.
Instead, if you run MIDI mapper, it will always default to the share directory
on the network (W:\WINSHARE).

WORKAROUND
==========

The only possible workaround is to set up Windows on each workstation. This way
each user will have his or her own copy of MIDI mapper.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MIDI mapper is an application that allows you to set up information such as key
maps, patch maps, and channel mappings for a MIDI device. Because it is possible
for different workstations on a network to have different sound cards, each
workstation should be able to be configured independently. Windows, through a
network installation, does not allow you to do this. It will always look to the
shared directory to find the files MIDIMAP.DRV and MIDIMAP.CFG. Even if these
files are copied to each individual's user directory, MIDI mapper will still
look to the shared directory for its information.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows version 3.1. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here as it becomes
available.
