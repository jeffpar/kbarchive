The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, 16-bit edition, versions 1.0, 1.5, 1.51, 1.52 
- Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft C/C++ versions 7.0 and later compilers eliminate unreferenced
constant strings. This happens only with C++ source, not C source. The string is
declared in the source file, but is not included in the resulting object module.

CAUSE
=====

In C++, const variables have internal linkage. This is different from the way
that C handles const variables.

In this case, because the C++ compiler can process only one source file at a
time, the string is eliminated if it is not referenced in the file in which it
is declared, even if it is referenced from another file.

RESOLUTION
==========

The solution is to declare the const string as "extern". This provides external
linkage, telling the compiler that the string may be used in another module, and
not to assume that it is an unreferenced symbol; for example

  const char sz[] = "\"the string\"";

would be optimized away in a C++ module, but the following string would not:

  extern const char sz[] = "\"the string"\";

MORE INFORMATION
================

While this behavior is not a bug in the compiler, the effects of this
optimization may cause unexpected results. If a string is declared and
initialized in one module, and referenced only in another module, the string
will be eliminated from the first module. This means that the other file will
not have access to the information used in the initialization of the string.

For more information on internal and external linkage, see section 2.4 of the
""C++ Language Reference"" supplied with C/C++ version 7.0 and Visual C++, or
refer to the online help supplied with Visual C++.
