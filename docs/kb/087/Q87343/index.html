SUMMARY
=======

HLPGLOSS is a file in the Microsoft Download Center that demonstrates how to add
a Glossary button to the button bar in the Microsoft Windows Help application.
The help file for the Windows Program Manager is an example of a popular help
file that has a Glossary button. When the user chooses the Glossary button, Help
displays the Glossary topic in a secondary window.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download
Center:

  Hlpgloss.exe

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

To create a Glossary button, two items must be added to the Help project (.HPJ)
file:

1. In the [CONFIG] section, add the CreateButton macro, which creates the
  "Glossary" button and programs the button to jump to the topic that contains
  glossary information.

  The third parameter of the CreateButton macro can contain the JumpContents,
  JumpContext, or JumpID macro. Specify JumpContents to move to the Contents
  topic of a Help file. Specify JumpContext to jump to the topic in a Help file
  with a specific context number. Specify JumpID to jump to the topic in a Help
  file with a specific context identifier. Any of these macros can move to a
  topic in the current Help file or to a topic in a different Help file.

  NOTE: If the glossary topic is in a different .HLP file, the [WINDOWS] section
  in its .HPJ file must define the secondary window. For more information on
  the CreateButton macro, see pages 309 and 310 of the "Programmer's Reference,
  Volume 4: Resources" manual distributed with version 3.1 of the Microsoft
  Windows Software Development Kit (SDK).

2. In the [WINDOWS] section, add a definition for the secondary window in which
  glossary information is displayed. This line defines the size, position, and
  color of the secondary window. For more information on the [WINDOWS] section
  of the .HPJ file, see pages 64 through 66 of the Windows SDK "Programming
  Tools" manual.

The following fragment of an .HPJ file demonstrates these two steps:

  [CONFIG]
  ; Because the help topic is in this Help file and the context
  ; identifier is available, the code below specifies the JumpId (JI)
  ; macro. The glossary is shown in the secondary "Glossary" window
  ; specified in the [WINDOWS] section below. The peculiar single quotes
  ; are significant. Note: In an actual Help project file, the following
  ; information appears on one line (no break).
  CreateButton("Glossary_Btn","&amp;Glossary","JI(`hlpgloss.hlp&gt;Gloss',
  `Glossary_Context')")

  [WINDOWS]
  ; Define the secondary window for the glossary in the [WINDOWS]
  ; section of the HPJ file for the Help file that contains the glossary
  ; topic.
  Gloss = "Glossary",(100,100,350,350),0,(255,255,255),(255,255,255)
