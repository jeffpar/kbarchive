-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use a client computer that is running either Microsoft Windows 95,
Microsoft Windows 98, or Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition to print to a
network printer that is installed as part of a Microsoft cluster or standalone
server, you may receive the following error message:

  The test page fails to print. Would you like to view the print trouble
  shooter for assistance. Access is denied.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur if the McAfee Anti-Virus monitoring software is set to
perform a real-time scan of files on either the client that is running Windows
95, Windows 98, or Windows 98 Second Edition or on the server that is running
Windows NT Server 4.0.

McAfee Anti-Virus scans the spooled files while the print job is being processed.
Windows cannot close the files because McAfee Anti-Virus has the files open.
These files are left in the Systemroot\System32\Spool\Printers folder. The
spooled .shd and .spl files remain in the folder after the print job is
displayed as completed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, use either of the methods that are described in this
section.
