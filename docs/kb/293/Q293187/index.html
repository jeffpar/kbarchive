SYMPTOMS
========

When you review Server Message Block (SMB) traffic between a Systems Management
Server (SMS) client and Client Access Points, you may see clients attempting to
find packages (such as SO100001.pkg) in the
\\%CAPSERVER%\CAP_%sitecode%\PkgInfo.box folder that have been deleted from the
SMS Administrator console.

This is an example of this traffic that you can see with Network Monitor:

  Client-&gt;CAP
  C transact2 Findfirst, File = \PkgInfo.box\S0100001.PKG

  CAP-&gt;Client
  R transact2 - NT Error, System, Error, Code - (15) STATUS_NO_SUCH_FILE

The Smsapm32.log file contains the following entry:

  TEST : The constructed file path is
  '\\SERVER01\CAP_SO1\PkgInfo.box\S0100001.PKG'.
  TEST : IsCurrent(\\SERVER01\CAP_SO1\PkgInfo.box\S0100001.PKG) =
  TRUE~
  SCHED DATA : Failed to get package object.~

==========

Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
