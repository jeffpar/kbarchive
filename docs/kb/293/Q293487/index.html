-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server (SMS) advertisements that contain programs that are
set to run at the next logon may intermittently not run on computers that run
Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows 98.

If you review the Smsapm32.log file immediately after logging on, you can see
that the program will not run as shown here:

  SCHEDULER : This is a trigger type job. It will execute either on reboot,
  logon, or logoff.~.

CAUSE
=====

The SMS client components are started even if no user logs on after starting the
computer. Because the network in Windows 95 and Windows 98 does not start until
a user logs on, the SMS Client Offer data providers (ODPs) cannot connect to the
Client Access Point (CAP) and generate a "The network is not present or not
started" error message. When a user does log on, Smsapm32 attempts to schedule
the advertisement during its user logon event processing, but cannot because the
ODPs have not recovered from the previous error condition.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q288239 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack

STATUS
======

listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
