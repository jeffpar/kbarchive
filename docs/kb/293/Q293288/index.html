SYMPTOMS
========

The Internet Mail Service may stop processing inbound or outbound SMTP mail and
may stop responding (hang) in an uncontrollable state. If you attempt to restart
the Internet Mail Service, the information store may stop responding and one or
more of the following error messages may be generated:

  Event ID: 4116
  Source: MSExchangeIMC
  An error was returned from the messaging software the Internet Mail Service
  uses to process messages on the Microsoft Exchange Server. It is possible
  that the piece of mail being processed at the time will be returned to the
  sender as a failed delivery instead of being delivered. The message will be
  moved to the "BAD" folder, if possible, and the error is not a temporary
  error. Otherwise it will be retried when the service is restarted. Use the
  appropriate utilities found in the SUPPORT directory of your Exchange CD to
  view and manipulate messages that have been moved to the "BAD" folder

  Event ID: 3039
  Source: MSExchangeIMC
  The error 0x80040115 was encountered while trying to communicate with the
  message store. An attempt to refresh the connection will be made. If not
  successful, the service will be shut down. Data (Words) 0000: 00140667
  80040115

  Event ID 12007
  Source: MSExchangeIS
  Type: Error
  Category: Content Engine
  Description: Error 0-82000080 occurred while processing message (Long Message
  ID) with subject (The subject of the message) from (Sender's Name). The
  archive filename is 'VMS95LCZ'.

  Event ID: 4182
  Source: MSExchangeIMC
  Type: Error
  Category: Internal Processing
  Description: An error was returned from the messaging software the Internet
  Mail Service uses to process messages on the Microsoft Exchange Server. As a
  result, the message in spool file HBWK2Q2P will be retried when the server is
  restarted.

  Event ID: 4102
  Source: MSExchangeIMC
  Type: Error
  Category: Internal Processing
  Description: A serious error has occurred while trying to send mail into the
  Exchange Information Store. The Internet Mail Service is being shut down.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur on the Exchange Server computer that is running the
Internet Mail Service if the header of a message contains malformed
information:

  --=_ Boundary 1-KTwEv4jY84Hk
  Content-Type: text/plain;
  charset = ""
  Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue:

1. Use the error messages that are generated to identify the message IDs of the
  malformed messages.

2. In Windows Explorer, locate the Imcdata\In and Imcdata\Out folders and either
  move or delete the messages that you identified as malformed. Search for
  messages that come from the same domain name. (In one situation where this
  issue occurred, all of the malformed messages came from one domain.)

3. Either apply the information store post-Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 3
  (SP3) fix or upgrade the information store to version 2653.22 or later. The
  best way to upgrade the information store is to apply Exchange Server 5.5
  Service Pack 4 (SP4).

4. Restart the Internet Mail Service and see if the information store keeps
  running and if messages are processed successfully.

5. If the Internet Mail Service brings in more malformed messages that may cause
  the information store to hang again, change the Internet Mail Service to
  outbound only:

  a. Open the Internet Mail Service properties, and then click the Connections
     tab.

  b. Under Transfer Mode, click "Outbound only".

  c. Click OK, and then and stop and restart the Internet Mail Service.

6. Restart the Internet Mail Service. If the information store keeps running and
  processes all messages, reconfigure the Internet Mail Service to both inbound
  and outbound.

7. Identify the malformed messages again (see step 1) and move the malformed
  messages (see step 2). You can do this on the Connections tab.

8. Restart the Internet Mail Service.
