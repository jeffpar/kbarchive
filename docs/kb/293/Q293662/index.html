-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to use your user account in a domain, you may repeatedly be
locked out.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if a computer that is running Microsoft Windows 95,
Microsoft Windows 98, or Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition (Me) is logged on
to the network with a domain account whose password had been changed on a
different computer. The Windows 95-based, Windows 98-based, or Windows Me-based
computer is still using the previous account information when it attempts to
perform Systems Management Server (SMS) tasks, such as, when it checks for new
software distributions or transfers inventory information.

The use of the previous password can cause the domain account to lock out a user
account. The user that has logged on to the computer is using the password that
the user had originally used to log on to the computer, not the new password
that had been changed on another computer. The SMS client computer continues
with its normal SMS processes and can continually lock out the user account
until the client is logged off from the computer.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, go to the original computer (the logged-on computer
that is locking out the user account) and log off from the computer.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This problem is a limitation of the Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows Me
platform: To only perform network activity in the context of the logged-on user.
The Microsoft Windows NT and Microsoft Windows 2000 platforms do not have this
limitation.
