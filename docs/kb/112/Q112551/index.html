The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how reconfigure your Windows 3.11 installation to run
Windows 3.10 using your original Windows 3.10 disks.


MORE INFORMATION
================

To install Windows 3.10 files over a local installation of Windows 3.11:

1. Quit Microsoft Windows.

2. Create a backup directory. For example, to create a backup directory off the
  root of drive C, type "md c:\backup" (without the quotation marks) at the
  MS-DOS command prompt and then press ENTER.

3. Copy the files listed below from your Windows SYSTEM subdirectory to the
  backup directory or a floppy disk.

  COMMDLG.DLL
  GDI.EXE
  KRNL386.EXE
  PSCRIPT.DRV
  SHELL.DLL
  UNIDRV.DLL
  USER.EXE

  To do this, use the following syntax

  copy &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;windir&gt;\system\&lt;filename&gt;
  &lt;drive&gt;:\&lt;backdir&gt;

  where &lt;drive&gt; is your hard disk drive, &lt;windir&gt; is your Windows
  directory, &lt;filename&gt; is the file you are copying, and &lt;backdir&gt;
  is your backup directory.

  For example, if your hard disk drive is C, your Windows directory is named
  WINDOWS, you are copying COMMDLG.DLL, and your backup directory is named
  C:\BACKUP, type the following:

  copy c:\windows\system\commdlg.dll c:\backup

  Repeat this command for the remaining files.

4. Using the table at the end of this article, insert the appropriate disks, one
  by one, and expand the following files to your Windows SYSTEM subdirectory.

  COMMDLG.DL_
  GDI.EX_
  KRNL386.EX_
  PSCRIPT.DR_
  UNIDRV.DL_
  SHELL.DL_
  USER.EX_

  For example, insert Disk 4 of the 3.5 inch, 1.44-megabyte (MB) disk set and
  type the following at the MS-DOS command prompt:

  expand a:\commdlg.dl_ c:\windows\system\commdlg.dll

  PSCRIPT.DR_ should be expanded to PSCRIPT.DRV, .DL_ files should be expanded
  to .DLL, and .EX_ files should be expanded to .EXE.

  NOTE: After you copy the new USER.EXE file to your Windows SYSTEM
  subdirectory, your registered user and company name will be blank.

5. If you use Novell NetWare connectivity, do the following:

  a. Use a text editor (such as Windows Notepad) to open your SYSTEM.INI file,
     which is located in your Windows directory.

  b. In the [386Enh] section, change DEVICE=VTDA.386 to DEVICE=*VTD.

  c. Save the file and quit the text editor.

To install Windows 3.10 files over a network installation of Windows 3.11:

1. Determine the location of your SYSTEM.INI file and the network share that
  contains your shared Windows files. For example, if the network drive
  containing your Windows program files is Q, the location of your shared
  Windows files may be Q:\WINSHARE and your user directory may be
  Q:\USER\YOURNAME (or your user directory may be located on your local hard
  disk drive).

2. Quit Microsoft Windows.

3. Create a backup directory. For example, to create a backup directory off the
  root of drive C, type MD C:\BACKUP at the MS-DOS command prompt and then
  press ENTER.

4. Copy the following files from the network share to the backup directory on
  your hard disk drive using the following syntax at the MS-DOS command prompt
  and then press ENTER.

  copy &lt;netdrive&gt;:\&lt;netshare&gt;\&lt;filename&gt;
  &lt;harddrive&gt;:\&lt;backdir&gt;

  where &lt;netdrive&gt; is the network drive, &lt;netshare&gt; is the network
  share containing your SYSTEM.INI file, &lt;filename&gt; is the file you are
  copying, &lt;harddrive&gt; is your hard disk drive, and &lt;backdir&gt; is
  your backup directory.

  For example, if your network drive is Q, the network share is WINSHARE, the
  file you want to copy is COMMDLG.DLL, your hard disk drive is C, and your
  backup directory is named C:\BACKUP, type the following:

  copy q:\winshare\commdlg.dll c:\backup

  Repeat this command for the remaining files:

  COMMDLG.DLL
  GDI.EXE
  KRNL386.EXE
  PSCRIPT.DRV
  UNIDRV.DLL
  SHELL.DLL
  USER.EXE

5. Remove the read-only file attributes on the shared Windows files using the
  MS-DOS ATTRIB command.

6. Using the table at the end of this article, insert the appropriate disks, one
  by one, and expand the following files to the network drive and share that
  contains your Windows files:

  COMMDLG.DL_
  GDI.EX_
  KRNL386.EX_
  PSCRIPT.DR_
  UNIDRV.DL_
  SHELL.DL_
  USER.EX_

  For example, insert Disk 4 of the 5.25-inch, 1.2-MB disk set and type the
  following at the MS-DOS command prompt:

  expand a:\commdlg.dl_ q:\winshare\commdlg.dll

  PSCRIPT.DR_ should be expanded to PSCRIPT.DRV, .DL_ files should be expanded
  to .DLL, and .EX_ files should be expanded to .EXE.

  NOTE: After you copy the new USER.EXE file to your Windows SYSTEM
  subdirectory, your registered user and company name will be blank.

7. Reset the read-only file attributes on the shared Windows files using the
  MS-DOS ATTRIB command.

8. If you use Novell NetWare connectivity, do the following:

  a. Use a text editor (such as Windows Notepad) to open your SYSTEM.INI file.

  b. In the [386Enh] section, change DEVICE=VTDA.386 to DEVICE=*VTD.

  c. Save the file and quit the text editor.
