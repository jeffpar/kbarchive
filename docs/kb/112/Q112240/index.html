SUMMARY
=======

Screens created with the Screen Wizard do not alter the setting of SET
EXCLUSIVE. In order to use a screen that was created with the Screen Wizard in a
multiuser environment, you must issue the SET EXCLUSIVE OFF command before
running the screen.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: A database can be opened as SHARED without issuing SET EXCLUSIVE OFF prior
to opening the database.

  Wizard in a multiuser environment.
