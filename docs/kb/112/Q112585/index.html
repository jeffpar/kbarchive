-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Arcade for Windows, version 1.0 
- Microsoft Golf for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you play Golf for Windows or one of the games in Arcade for Windows for a
period between five minutes and two hours, the program may stop responding
(hang).

The Arcade Readme.txt file mentions this issue. However, the Readme.txt file
incorrectly states that the issue only occurs after 2 hours.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the following conditions are true:

- You play Arcade on a Microsoft Windows 3.1-based computer.

- You need to install update drivers for the Creative Labs Sound Blaster 16
  sound card installed in your computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, download and install the latest version of the Windows
3.1 drivers for the Sound Blaster 16 sound card from the following Creative Labs
Web site:

  http://www.soundblaster.com

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you encounter this issue on a Microsoft Windows 95/98-based computer, remove
the Windows 3.1 sound drivers, and then install the Windows 95/98 sound drivers
from the Windows installation CD-ROM.

If you do not have access to the Internet, contact Creative Labs to inquire about
how to obtain and install the latest version of the drivers for your Sound
Blaster 16 sound card on your version of Windows.

For additional information about how to contact Creative Labs, please see the
