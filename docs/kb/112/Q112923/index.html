-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1x, 3.0, 3.0a, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With versions 2.1x, 3.0, 3.0a, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, when
you modify local user details on your postoffice from within ADMIN.EXE, the
following error may occur:

  Notice 99
  Unable to Access Address Record

CAUSE
=====

The cause can be insufficient network rights and file corruption, particularly
with the Access files (ACCESS.GLB, ACCESS2.GLB, and ACCESS3.GLB).

RESOLUTION
==========

The Access files should be checked by using the following figures to divide the
file size by. The file is not corrupt if the number you get after dividing is a
whole number.

NOTE: Although the files may divide out correctly, this does not guarantee that
they are corruption free.

  ACCESS.GLB      divide by      586
  ACCESS2.GLB     divide by       69
  ACCESS3.GLB     divide by      512

The ADMIN.NME and ADMINSHD.NME files can be checked; they should be the same size
and date stamp. If the ADMIN.NME file is corrupt (it should be divisible by 45),
you can run ACCTONME.EXE to regenerate it.

The corrupt ADMIN.NME file will need to be zeroed out. Delete the file then use
the following command:

  type AAA &gt; ADMIN.NME

ACCTONME can then be run from the root of the mail database. Copy the newly
generated ADMIN.NME file to ADMINSHD.NME.

The preferred method of resolving this error message is to restore from backup.
The files to restore are ACCESS.GLB, ACCESS2.GLB, ACCESS3.GLB, ADMIN.NME,
ADMINSHD.NME, ADMIN.GRP, and ADMINSHD.GRP. They should all be restored from the
most recent valid backup.

If users have been added to the mail system since this backup, these users will
have to be redefined after the restoration.

For the MS-DOS workstation users, they should make an archive of their mail
folders and Inbox, prior to restoring the files, which can be de-archived upon
recreation of the mailbox.

For Mail for Windows users, they should make a backup of their .MMF file, prior
to restoring the files, which can be re-imported using Import Folders upon
recreation of their mailbox.
