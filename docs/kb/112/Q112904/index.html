-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you add users to or modify a personal address list from the MS-DOS Mail
client, the following error may occur:

  Notice 53:
  Error Creating User Address in Personal Address List

CAUSE
=====

This error can be caused by insufficient network rights, a corrupted or missing
address list file (&lt;xxxxxxx&gt;.NME file, where &lt;xxxxxxxx&gt; is the
user's hexadecimal ID), or a missing .NME file.

The error can also be caused by an ownerless .NME file for an user (on Novell) or
an ownerless .NME directory (on Novell). The client is looking for the user's
HEXID.NME and cannot get the information if the directory is ownerless.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, ensure that the user has sufficient network rights to
the database. If the file is missing or corrupted and no backup exists, create a
test user. Copy the test user's .NME file to the .NME file of the user
experiencing the problem. Add names as required.

A second option (see the note below before you attempt this resolution) is to
copy the ADMIN.NME file to &lt;xxxxxxx&gt;.NME. This makes the complete
postoffice address list (POL) the user's personal address list (PAL), and any
unnecessary names can be deleted.

NOTE: If the ADMIN.NME file has a user "Foreign Admin" who is the administrator
of another postoffice (added by using the Address, Create command in the Mail
Administrator program) and a user deletes "Foreign Admin" from the PAL, the
MS-DOS Mail client goes to the NETPO.GLB file and marks the "Foreign Admin"
record there as deleted. The name remains in the PAL, however, and if the user
tries to send mail to "Foreign Admin" from the PAL, the following error
results:

  Address is no longer valid

If neither of these methods works, you may have to reset the NETPO.GLB file by
using the MS-DOS DEBUG program with the following commands:

(NOTE: Make a backup copy of the NETPO.GLB file before you proceed with the steps
below.)

  debug netpo.glb
  -f100,103,0
  -w
  -q

This will reset the first 4 bytes of the file.
