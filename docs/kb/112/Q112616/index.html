The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Windows for Workgroups 3.11 is installed with DEC Pathworks configured as
the primary network, you may receive the following error message when you start
Windows:

  System Error -- Network error on drive x

where &lt;x&gt; is the drive letter connecting a DEC Pathworks server.

After you choose Cancel a number of times, you may be able to proceed into
Windows for Workgroups. However, if you try to access a DEC Pathworks server
drive from File Manager, you receive the following message

  An error occurred reading drive D:

or, if you try to access a DEC Pathworks drive from the MS-DOS Prompt in Windows,
you receive the following Pathworks error message:

  NET804: Network busy - remote node not responding

CAUSE
=====

Primary networks, including Microsoft LAN Manager, Artisoft LANtastic, and DEC
Pathworks, may use some network drivers that are incompatible with the
IFSHLP.SYS device driver that is loaded with Windows for Workgroups 3.11.

RESOLUTION
==========

To properly run Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with one of these networks as a
primary network, you must remove the IFSHLP.SYS device driver from the
CONFIG.SYS file.

NOTE: If IFSHLP.SYS is not loaded, 32-bit file access is not available.

You may also be able to workaround this problem by obtaining the integration kit
for Windows for Workgroups provided by DEC. It allows DEC Pathworks and the
Windows for Workgroups 3.11 network functionality to coexist by setting up
DECNET as a protocol on an existing Windows for Workgroups installation.
IFSHLP.SYS does not need to be removed with this installation. For more
information, contact DEC technical support, or the DECPCI forum on CompuServe.
