SYMPTOMS
========

You are running more than one software metering server and licenses are not
being balanced correctly. This article describes how you can identify the
problem area.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Items to Check If Licenses Are Not Being Correctly Balanced
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Is the schedule configured appropriately?

  If the scheduled balancing is set too far apart, there may be servers with too
  many available licenses and other servers without any available licenses. You
  can check to see what the trend is in the log of historical activities, and
  then set the schedule accordingly.

- Does the License Metering component have access to all software metering
  servers?

  License Metering connects to each server through Open Database Connectivity
  (ODBC) and queries each server for its minimum license number and buffer from
  the reserve pool. License balancing then occurs between servers based on the
  procured information (LICSRVC.log).

- Does License Metering have to do license balancing too often, which indicates
  that there are too many clients that need an application license for too many
  applications at once?

  If License Metering is constantly dealing with instant license balancing,
  scheduled license balancing and general response speed will suffer. A study
  of the historical trend in license balancing and user callbacks will help you
  in designing the system to ensure that License Metering is not constantly
  distributing licenses on demand from low-activity to high-activity servers.
