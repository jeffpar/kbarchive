SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how Golf 99 introduces random variation in your shots
based on your skill level. This new feature increases game realism by decreasing
your chances of scoring a hole-in-one.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you play Golf 99 at the Beginner or Amateur skill level, the game
introduces a small amount of random variation in your perfect shots. The
deviation for your shot increases as the distance of your shot increases. When
you increase the range of your driver, you significantly increase the deviation
of your shot.

When you play Golf 99 at the Beginner skill level and use a driver with a
modified range of 300 yards, any perfect drive you hit may vary wildly to the
left or right.

The following table lists the variation introduced by Golf 99 in perfect shots
for different player skill levels and shots:

  Level      Shot                         Variation
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------

  Beginner   Perfect chip &lt; 75 yds        90% becomes 1-degree-off chip
                                          10% perfect chip with random
                                          variation

             Perfect chip &lt; 25 yds        75% becomes 2-degree-off chip
                                          25% perfect chip with random
                                          variation

             1-degree-off chip &lt; 25 yds   75% becomes 2-degree-off chip
                                          25% 1-degree-off chip with
                                          random variation

                                          variation
