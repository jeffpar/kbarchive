SYMPTOMS
========

When you run an ASP file that performs a database query, one of the following
error messages may occur:

  Error 'ASP 0115'
  Unexpected error
  /&lt;RelativePath&gt;/&lt;ASP_File_Name&gt;.asp
  A trappable error occurred in an external object. The script cannot continue
  running.

  Inetinfo application error "The instruction at 0x77f6467a referenced memory
  at 0x64002e00 the memory could not be written.

Note: The Roadmap sample Web site contains ASP files that can cause the above
error messages to occur if the ACL permissions are not set correctly.

CAUSE
=====

When you perform a query (either IDQ or ADO), it is executed in the context of
the Windows NT user account that has been authenticated on the Web site. The
errors occur when the user account does not have the appropriate permissions in
the Access Control Lists (ACLs) for all resources used by the query.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, perform the following steps:

1. Grant Read permission to the user account (IUSR_&lt;ComputerName&gt; by
  default) for the following directories:

   - The root directory of the disk that contains the ASP file.

   - The %SystemRoot%\system32\ directory.

   - The %SystemRoot%\system32\inetserv directory.

   - The Web site's home directory (C:\InetPub by default).

  Note: If ADO queries are being used, grant Read permission to the following
  directories:

   - C:\Program Files\Common Files\System\ole db

   - C:\Program Files\Common Files\System\ado

2. Grant Change permission to the user account for the actual database file
  being used, as well as the directory that contains that file.

3. Grant Write permission to the user account for the system's temporary
  directory. (This directory is specified by the system TEMP and TMP
  environment variables. For more information on temporary variables, see the
  following section.)

MORE INFORMATION
================

Temporary Variables:

The Jet database engine creates temporary files in the temporary directory during
Jet operations. By default, these environment variables are defined for each
user profile, and are not system-wide settings. To modify them, use one of the
following methods:

- System-Wide Settings

  In the Autoexec.bat file (located in the root of the system drive), add lines
  similar to the following, using the path to the directory that you want to
  keep temporary files:

  Set TEMP=C:\Temp
  Set TMP =C:\Temp

  For the Autoexec.bat file to be read with the new settings, you will need to
  restart the computer.

- User Settings

  To set the variables only for the user who's currently logged on to the
  server, perform the following steps:

  1. On the desktop, right-click My Computer, and the click Properties.

  2. Click the Environment tab.

  3. Under User Variables for &lt;User_Name&gt;, change the values for both the
     TEMP and TMP variables, and then click OK.

  4. Log off, and then log back on to the Windows NT computer.
