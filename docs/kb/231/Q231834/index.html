The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Learning Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, versions 5.0, 6.0 
- ActiveX Data Objects (ADO), versions 2.1 SP2, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you attempt to use ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) to access SQL Server databases
through the ODBC provider (MSDASQL), you will receive the following error if you
specify adAsyncFetchNonBlocking with Server-side cursors:

  -2147217890 lRowsOffset would position you past either end of the rowset,
  regardless of the cRows value specified; cRowsObtained is 0.

The following error is returned from ADO 2.5:

  -2147217890 No rows were returned because the offset value moves the position
  before the beginning or after the end of the rowset.

NOTE: If you are using the SQLOLEDB provider you will not see this error message.
However, fetching is still not supported for the cursor and it is blocked until
the cursor is fully populated.

CAUSE
=====

The adAsyncFetchNonBlocking recordset option is not supported with a Server
cursor. Additional enhancements would be required for the server and client in
order to implement this feature. The two way communication necessary to support
adAsyncFetchNonBlocking with a server cursor is not available at this time.

RESOLUTION
==========

adAsyncFetchNonBlocking is only supported with a Client cursor when you use 2.5
or earlier versions of MDAC.

STATUS
======

MDAC 2.6 supports adAsyncFetchNonBlocking for server side cursors. Earlier
versions of MDAC do not support this.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Step to Reproduce Behavior
--------------------------

1. Paste the following code into SQL Server's ISQL_w or Query Analyzer Utility.
  Select a database with at least 2.5 MB of free space and execute the code.
  This code creates the test table and populates it with data.

  create table adoAsyncTest
  (
  	col1 int identity(1,1) primary key,
  	col2 varchar(255),
  	col3 varchar(255)
  )
  go
  set nocount on
  declare @iCnt int
  select @iCnt=1
  while @iCnt &lt; 5001
  begin
  	insert into adoAsyncTest values('my test data col1', 'my test data col2')
  	select @iCnt = @iCnt + 1
  end

2. Open Visual Basic and create a new Standard EXE Project. Form1 is created by
  default.

3. Add a reference to the Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 2.x Library.

4. Paste the following code into the General Declarations section of the form:

  Option Explicit

  Private WithEvents adoCn As ADODB.Connection
  Private WithEvents adoRs As ADODB.Recordset
  Private adoErr As Errors

  Private Sub Form_Load()

  Dim strConnect As String
  strConnect = "Driver={SQL Server};Server=&lt;ServerName&gt;;User ID=&lt;UserID&gt;;Password=&lt;Password&gt;;Initial Catalog=&lt;Database&gt;"

  Set adoCn = New ADODB.Connection
  With adoCn
      '.Provider = "SQLOLEDB"
      .ConnectionString = strConnect
      .Open
  End With

  Set adoRs = New ADODB.Recordset
  With adoRs
      Set .ActiveConnection = adoCn
      .CursorLocation = adUseServer 'adUseClient
      .CursorType = adOpenStatic
      .LockType = adLockReadOnly
      .Open "SELECT * FROM adoAsyncTest", , , , (adCmdText + adAsyncFetchNonBlocking)
  End With

  Debug.Print "Executing Async..."

  End Sub

  Private Sub adoCn_ExecuteComplete(ByVal RecordsAffected As Long, ByVal pError As ADODB.Error, adStatus As ADODB.EventStatusEnum, ByVal pCommand As ADODB.Command, ByVal pRecordset As ADODB.Recordset, ByVal pConnection As ADODB.Connection)

  Debug.Print "---------Execute Complete---------"
  Debug.Print "RecordCount = " &amp; adoRs.RecordCount

  End Sub

  Private Sub adoRs_FetchComplete(ByVal pError As ADODB.Error, adStatus As ADODB.EventStatusEnum, ByVal pRecordset As ADODB.Recordset)

  Debug.Print "---------Fetch Complete---------"

  End Sub

  Private Sub adoRs_FetchProgress(ByVal Progress As Long, ByVal MaxProgress As Long, adStatus As ADODB.EventStatusEnum, ByVal pRecordset As ADODB.Recordset)

  Debug.Print "Fetch Progress = " &amp; pRecordset.RecordCount

  End Sub

5. Run the project. Do not step through the project, as stepping will change the
  behavior.

6. Change the CursorLocation to adUseClient to resolve the error.

NOTE: You can use adAsyncExecute with a Server cursor, which enhances the
responsiveness of your application. Using adAsyncExecute enables your
application to perform other tasks while waiting on the server cursor to
populate. However, you will not be able to use the recordset until an
ExecuteComplete event fires, which indicates the server cursor is fully
populated. With a Client cursor, you get more flexibility in async mode and you
can check the Fetch progress of the cursor population as the rows are fetched to
the client cursor.
