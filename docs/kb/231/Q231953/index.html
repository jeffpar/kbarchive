SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to restrict permissions for Telnet users with
Services for UNIX Telnet Server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Telnet allows users to gain access to resources on your Telnet servers. It is
important to review your security policy and implement appropriate protection.

NOTE: Microsoft recommends using the NTFS file system when you use Telnet with
Services for UNIX. The file allocation table (FAT) file system provides no
file-level security and may present serious security risks.

To restrict permissions to certain files or folders:

1. Create a local group and name it TelnetUsers.

2. Give the TelnetUsers group No Access permissions for all files and folders on
  drives C and F. (The Windows NT folder (%SystemRoot%) is located on drive C,
  and the TelnetUsers Home folders are located on drive F.)

3. Give the TelnetUsers group Read and Add permissions to the %SystemRoot%
  folder. Set these permissions only to the folder, not to any files or
  subfolders.

4. Give the TelnetUsers group Read permissions to the following files in the
  %SystemRoot%\System32 folder:

   - Rpcltc1.dll

   - Cmd.exe

   - Expand.exe

   - Help.exe

   - Pax.exe

   - More.exe

   - Ntlanman.dll

5. Give the TelnetUsers group List permissions to the %SystemRoot%\System32
  folder.

6. For each user in the TelnetUsers group, specify a home folder of
  F:\Home\%Username%. Give each individual Full Control to his or her own
  folder and remove permissions for anyone else.

7. Assign the TelnetUsers group List permissions to drive F.

8. Connect to the Telnet server as a user to ensure everything functions
  properly. Run Cmd.exe from the shell prompt and see if you can change
  directories to the F:\Home folder or above. Change to the C drive and try to
  delete anything or read anything to which you do not explicitly have
  permissions.

If you need to track the files your users are touching or if you receive error
messages after using the previously outlined steps, enable Security Auditing
through "User Manager/Policies/Audit/File and Object Access both success and
failure."
