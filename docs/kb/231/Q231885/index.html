The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Midtown Madness, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you play Microsoft Midtown Madness on a Microsoft Windows 98-based computer
configured to use multiple monitors, Midtown Madness may attempt to redetect the
video adapters installed in the computer each time you start a game.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if one or more video adapters installed in the computer
does not support Microsoft DirectDraw.

RESOLUTION
==========

You may be able to resolve this issue by installing the latest version of the
video driver available for each of your video adapters. Contact your hardware
manufacturer for information about how to obtain the latest video drivers for
your video adapters.

please see the following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

To work around this issue, disable the secondary video adapter installed in the
computer to prevent Midtown Madness from redetecting the video adapters. To do
this, follow these steps:

1. On the Midtown Madness startup screen, click Options.

2. Click Graphics Options.

3. Under Renderer, note the video adapters detected by Midtown Madness.

4. Click Done.

5. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

6. Double-click System.

7. On the Device Manager tab, click the PLUS SIGN (+) next to Display Adapters
  to expand the branch.
