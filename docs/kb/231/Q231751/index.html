-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

After applying Service Pack 2 (SP2) for Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5, you
cannot renew certificates from the Key Management Server. Clients receive e-mail
saying the request failed, and error 5006 is received on the server.

CAUSE
=====

A missed case caused the Key Management Server component to return an error
code.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: KM Server

+---------------------------+
| File name    | Version    | 
+---------------------------+
| Kmserver.exe | 5.5.2602.0 | 
+---------------------------+


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 2. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server
5.5 Service Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Even after the fix is applied, you will need to recover these accounts because
accounts that fail to renew generate a new signing key and send that to the
server. Then, when they fail to renew, they are never given back that signing
key. So now the client still has the first signing key (1) and the server has
the new signing key (2). After the fix is applied and the account tries to renew
again, it signs its request with signing key 1, but the server is expecting
signing key 2. The account must be recovered to get the same signing key to the
client and the server. After the recovery, the client and server are in sync,
and any renewal or recovery works fine.
