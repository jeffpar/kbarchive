SYMPTOMS
========

You can create and use public folders using Microsoft Outlook without any
problems, but if you attempt to view the properties of any of these newly
created public folders using the Exchange Server Administrator program, you may
receive the following error message:

  Object does not exist in the Directory. Replication may not have completed.

Events similar to the following may also be logged in the application event log:

  Event ID: 270
  Source: MsExchangeMTA
  Description: A permanent error has occurred with Entity
  /O=Organization/OU=SITE01/CN=CONFIGURATION/CN=SERVERS/CN=EXCHANGE0E/CN=MICROSOFT
  PUBLIC MDB. Entity is a Message Object is a Normal Priority Message.
  Object: 060000FD.

  PDU dump reference 26 [MTA SUBMIT 14 74] (14)

  Event ID: 2025
  Source: MsExchangeIS Public
  Description: The delivery of a message failed due to error FFFFF9BF. A
  non-delivery report is being sent to the message's originator.

If you run the DS/IS consistency adjuster, the following events are logged in the
application event log:

  Event ID: 7000
  Source: MsExchangeIS Public
  Description: Unable to update the directory service for the public folder ROOT
  FOLDER NAME\SUBFOLDER.

  Event ID: 7041
  Source: MsExchangeIS Public
  Description: Error 4021 occurred while creating the directory service object
  for public folder ROOT FOLDER NAME\SUBFOLDER.

CAUSE
=====

The service account does not have Add Child permissions set at the site level
for the site where the public folder server resides. If the service account does
not have Service Account Administrator permissions set, and does not have Add
Child permissions set for the site level, the problem described in the
"Symptoms" section occurs.

RESOLUTION
==========

Make sure that the service account has Service Account Administrator permissions
set for the organization, site, and configuration levels. If the service account
has Custom Role permissions set, it must have Add Child permissions set for the
site level. After you set the correct permissions, run the DS/IS consistency
adjuster to synchronize public folders with the directory.

NOTE: Microsoft strongly recommends that you review the functionality of the
DS/IS consistency adjuster before you use it. For additional information about
the process and effects of running the DS/IS consistency adjuster, click the

  Adjustment
