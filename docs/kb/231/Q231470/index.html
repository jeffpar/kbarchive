SUMMARY
=======



MORE INFORMATION
================

Only users who have the "Log on Locally" permission can gain access to the
Telnet server from the local computer's console. The Telnet server included with
the Services for UNIX Add-On Pack enables users to log on to the server over the
network. Users who have the permission to log on locally can make changes to the
computer over the network as though they were actually working on it locally.
The following groups have the "Log on Locally" permission enabled by default on
computers running Windows NT:

- Administrators
- Everyone
- Guests
- Power Users
- Users

NOTE: We recommend that you deny this permission to the Everyone and Guests
groups.

A Windows NT Server configured as a domain controller is configured by default to
give the following groups the "Log on Locally" permission:

- Account Operators
- Administrators
- Backup Operators
- Print Operators
- Server Operators

The "Access this computer from the network" permission enables a user to connect
to the computer over the network. The following groups have this permission
enabled by default on a computer running Windows NT:

- Administrators
- Everyone
- Power Users

The following groups have the "Access this computer from the network" permission
enabled by default on a Windows NT Server configured as a domain controller:

- Administrators
- Everyone

Although you usually start a Telnet session using a network connection, the shell
is running locally on the computer. The users or groups that connect need to
have the "Log on Locally" permission enabled to gain access to the Windows NT
SFU Telnet server. You can create a Telnet User group that has the "Log on
Locally" permission enabled, and then add each user you want to gain access the
Telnet server.
