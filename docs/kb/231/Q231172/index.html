-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the IIS 4.0 HTML Admin tool (HTMLA), Everyone is always listed in Operators
after you install Windows NT Service Pack 4. Everyone can be deleted using
HTMLA, but it will reappear after closing and re-entering HTMLA. Other strange
symptoms have been reported, but not verified.

The MMC (Microsoft Management Console) lists the correct operators. Actual
permissions are not effected.

CAUSE
=====

A regression occurs in the Iiadmhd.asp file that causes Everyone to always
appear in the HTMLA.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use the MMC.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:
