-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition versions 4.0 SP4, 4.0 SP5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you log on to a Windows NT computer using cached domain account
information, you cannot connect to share points defined on the local computer
using your cached credentials.

If you try to connect to a local share using cached credentials, you are prompted
for a password. After you type a password, the connection attempt is
unsuccessful and you receive a "bad password" or "unknown user name" or error
messages. However, you can still connect to local share points using locally
defined user accounts.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is a result of the application of the LSA2-FIX security hotfix. The
LSA2-FIX is a Windows NT 4.0 post-Service Pack 3 hotfix that is also included in
Service Pack 4 and Service Pack 5.

When the LSA2-FIX is applied, connections to share points are allowed only if a
domain controller is available to revalidate your cached credentials. This is
incorrect behavior. Your cached credentials should be accepted as valid, and the
connection attempt should succeed, as long as your domain account has
appropriate access rights to the share point.

For more information about the LSA2-FIX security hotfix, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q184017 Administrators Can Display Contents of Service Account Passwords
