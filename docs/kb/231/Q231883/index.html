-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are attempting to connect to the Systems Management Server (SMS) site
database by using the Systems Management Server Administrator console, the
connection attempt may take a long time, and then you may receive a "Connection
Failed: \\server\root\sms" status in the Microsoft Management console.

The following message may appear in the Smsprov.log file on the SQL server in the
Smsprov\logs folder:

  *
  *
  E:\OPALSP1\sdk_provider\nt\smsprov\SspObjectQuery.cpp(4177) : SQL Connection
  attempt timed out
  SQL Error: Login incorrect.
  *
*

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the SMSProvider_&lt;XXX&gt; account does not have
permission to connect to the SQL server database.

This problem may occur when the following conditions are true:

- The SMS site database is located on a SQL Server 6.5-based server that is
  external to the SMS site server.

- The SMS provider is located on the SQL server.

- The SQL Server 6.5-based server is using mixed or integrated security.

- In SQL Security Manager, the Windows NT Administrators group has been
  removed, or is no longer mapped to the 'sa' SQL login ID. A different Windows
  NT group may be mapped to the 'sa' SQL login ID.

WORKAROUND
==========

SMS requires that the following accounts belong to the local Administrators
group on the SQL server:

- SMSProvider_&lt;XXX&gt;, where &lt;XXX&gt; is the site code of the SMS site.

- SMSSvc_&lt;XXX&gt;_0000, where &lt;XXX&gt; is the site code of the SMS site.

In addition, if you are using integrated security in SQL server, the
Administrators group must be mapped to the 'sa' login ID in SQL Security
Manager.

To verify or correct the issue:

1. Start SQL Security Manager and connect to the SQL server on which the SMS
  site database resides.

2. On the View menu, click Sa Privilege.

3. In the main window, verify that the Administrators group is listed.

4. If the Administrators group is listed, expand the selection to see the
  members of the group. Verify that the Domain\SMSProvider_&lt;XXX&gt; and
  SQLSERVER\SMSSvc_&lt;XXX&gt;_0000 accounts are listed. If they are not
  listed, verify that they are listed in User Manager in the Administrators
  group.

If the Administrators group does not appear in the Sa Privilege view:

1. On the Security menu, click Grant New.

2. On the Grant Privilege list, click Administrators, and then click Grant. You
  should receive a "Permission Granted to Administrators" message.

3. Click OK.

4. When you are finished, click Done.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When the SMS provider and SMS SQL Monitor components are installed, the
SMSProvider_&lt;XXX&gt; and SMSSvc_&lt;XXX&gt;_0000 accounts are placed in the
local Administrators group on the SQL server. By default, under the integrated
security model, they are mapped to the 'sa' login ID, which gives the accounts
access to the SQL database.

If the members of the SQL server Administrators group are not mapped to a valid
SQL login ID with access to the SMS site database, they cannot connect.
