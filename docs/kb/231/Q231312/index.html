  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When the server comment is greater than 48 characters, the server name may
disappear from the browsing list. The server comment may be set by typing the
following command at an MS-DOS command prompt:

  "net config server /srvcomment:"text"" (without the quotation marks)

NOTE: This command does not allow you to specify a srvcomment greater than 48
characters. Nevertheless, the problem may exist if the srvcomment size is
greater than 48 characters when it set directly in the registry
(HKLM\System\CCS\Service\LanmanServer\Parameters).


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, ensure that the length of the server comment
(srvcomment) is not greater than 48 characters.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The 48 characters limitation of srvcomment is a design limitation.


When this symptom occurs, the browsing mechanism seems to work fine from a
network capture point of view. The Host Announcement and Local Master
Announcement are done normally. The full srvcomment is sent inside the network
datagram (even if the length of srvcomment is greater than 48 characters).
However, this kind of datagram is discarded by the master browser.

2000-Based Computer's Network Identification Properties, see:
