SYMPTOMS
========

After you restore from an online backup, the information store service fails to
start with service-specific error 3355443752. The application log contains the
following events:

  Event ID: 5000
  Source: MSExchangeIS
  Type: Error
  Category: General
  Unable to initialize the Microsoft Exchange Information Store service. Error
  0xc8000228.

  Event ID: 1080
  Source: MSExchangeIS
  Type: Error
  Category: Recovery
  Unable to recover the database because error 0xc8000228 occurred after a
  restore operation. The patch file is not generated from this backup.

  Event ID: 0
  Source: ESE97
  Type: Error
  Category: Logging/Recovery
  MSExchangeIS ((416) ) -552

The number within parenthesis on the last event may be different, but the -552 is
present.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is a result of running isinteg -patch or eseutil /r /is immediately
after you restore from an online backup and before you start the information
store service.

Only run isinteg -patch after you restore from an offline backup. If you run
isinteg -patch against an online restore, the databases are inconsistent (as
they always are after an online restore). At that point Isinteg runs a soft
recovery, which is the same as Eseutil /r /is.

An online restore restores patch files for both the private and public
information stores. Those patch files, Priv.pat and Pub.pat, contain
transactions that are not replayed during a soft recovery. Because of this, the
soft recovery results in a database that no longer matches the patch files and
may also produce a database that is damaged because of the missing transactions.
When the information store service starts, recovery fails with a -552
Jet_errDatabasePatchFileMismatch.

RESOLUTION
==========

Before you start the service, run another restore of the online backup without
running isinteg -patch.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Note that Isinteg -patch only runs if an Edb.log is present in the Information
Store Log folder. An online restore does not restore an Edb.log. Therefore, the
situation described here only occurs after you do a "no-loss restore" (which
retains all existing log files in the information store folders), and when you
follow that restore immediately with Isinteg -patch. This is not the only
situation that may generate a -552 error, and in other circumstances, the cause
and resolution may be different.
