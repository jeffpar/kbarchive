-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When scheduling a report to run Right Now using the Crystal Info product that
ships with Systems Management Server 2.0, the report does not run for an
extended amount of time, or does not run at all.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may occur when the computer running the Systems Management Server
Administrator Console is set to a time zone that does not support the
"Automatically adjust clock for daylight saving changes" option, while the Site
Server's time zone does support this option. This option, if available, can be
found within the Date/Time tool of Control Panel. The option will appear at the
bottom of the Time Zone tab if a time zone has been selected that supports this
option.



WORKAROUND
==========

Move the remote computer running the SMS Administrator Console to a time zone
that supports daylight savings.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the system date and time of a remote SMS administrator console is set behind
the server time the report will never be scheduled. For example, if the remote
SMS administrator console is set at 3:00 P.M. and the Site Server it is
connecting to is set at 4:00 P.M., the report will not be scheduled.
Periodically verify the remote console computer is synchronized with the time
and date on the Site Server to which it is remotely connecting.
