The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows 98 client computer may stop
responding. This problem may occur if:

1. The hotfixed Smsrun16.exe that is documented in the following article in the
  Microsoft Knowledge Base was applied:

  Q191067 SMS: PGC Fails to Configure Apps When Roaming Profiles Are Used

2. A value for the SmsrunStartupDelay was specified.

When this problem occurs, the computer running Windows 95/98 stops responding for
the entire duration of the SmsrunStartupDelay value specified.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date      Time         Size    File name      Platform
  ------------------------------------------------------

  5/3/99   9:33pm      100,572   Smsrun16.exe   x86

NOTE: Due to file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that contains
the above files may also contain additional files.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, replace the Smsrun16.exe file in the
&lt;SMS_root&gt;\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\&lt;Platform&gt;.bin directory
with the hotfixed version.

Maintenance Manager will replicate the new Smsrun16.exe to the
Logon.srv\&lt;Platform&gt;.bin directory on the Systems Management Server logon
servers during its next work cycle. After that occurs, you can update the
clients. To update the clients, either manually run Upgrade.bat on each client
or follow the instructions in the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:
