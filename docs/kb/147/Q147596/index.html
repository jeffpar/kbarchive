The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Screens developed under one resolution might not look the way you want them to
look when you run the screens on systems with different screen resolutions. One
solution is to develop several different screens under different resolutions,
and run the screen that is the same as the current resolution.

However, in Visual FoxPro, it is possible to dynamically resize the screen and
reposition objects on it based on the current resolution. This article shows by
example how to do this.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Create a new form while under 640x480 resolution. Add some controls such as
  text boxes, command buttons, and labels to the form.

2. Place the following code in the Init event of the form and in the Init event
  of any container objects such as a page on a pageframe that are on the form:

  ** Assumes a screen built at 640x480
  LOCAL lnHeight, lnWidth, lnHeightdiff, lnWidthdiff

  lnHeight = 480   &amp;&amp; The height of the original resolution
  lnWidth = 640    &amp;&amp; The width of the original resolution
  lnHeightdiff = 0 &amp;&amp; Variable to hold the height difference
  lnWidthdiff = 0  &amp;&amp; Variable to hold the width difference

  IF SYSMETRIC(2) &lt;&gt; lnHeight &amp;&amp; If this is not 640x480 resolution
     lnHeightDiff = SYSMETRIC(2) / lnHeight
     lnWidthDiff = SYSMETRIC(1) / lnWidth

  ** You need to remark out the code down to, but not including the,
  ** ENDIF line of code if this is in the Init of a container object
  ** such as a page on a pageframe, or any other non-form container
  ** object that has a Controls and ControlsCount property.

     This.Height = This.Height * lnHeightDiff
     This.Width = This.Width * lnWidthDiff
     This.Top = This.Top * lnHeightDiff
     This.Left = This.Left * lnHeightDiff

  ** The code goes through each object, resizes and
  ** repositions it.

     FOR i = 1 TO This.ControlCount
        WITH This.Controls(i)
           .Height = .Height * lnHeightdiff
           .Width = .Width * lnWidthdiff
           .Top = .Top * lnHeightdiff
           .Left = .Left * lnWidthdiff

  ** You could also resize the font at this point
  ** by changing the FontSize property, perhaps to
  ** IF TYPE(".FontSize") # "U"
  **    &amp;&amp; The IF ensures the control has a FontSize property
  **    .FontSize = .FontSize * ((.5 * lnWidthdiff) + (.5 * lnHeightdiff))
  ** ENDIF
  ** However, some higher screen resolutions can change
  ** the appearance of fonts considerably, so testing is
  ** advised before trying that step.

        ENDWITH
     ENDFOR
  ENDIF

  ThisForm.Refresh()

3. Run the form in a different resolution. Observe the automatic changes that
  are made.
