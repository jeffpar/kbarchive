SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the CalComp Wintab32 Digitizer Services and Driver version 3.2
for Windows NT 3.51, a serial mouse does not work and the following system
events are logged in the Event Viewer:

  Event ID: 3
  Source: Serial
  Description: User configuration data for parameter COM2 overriding firmware
  configuration data.

  Event ID: 11
  Source: Serial
  Description: The hardware resources for COMx are already in use by another
  device.

  Event ID: 22
  Source:Serial
  Description: A conflict has been detected between two drivers which claimed
  two overlapping Io port regions. Driver ccntdrv, with device
  &lt;\Device\PointerPort0.Translated&gt;, claimed an IO port range with
  starting address in data address 0x28 and 0x2c, and length in data address
  0x30.

  Event ID: 22
  Source:Serial
  Description: A conflict has been detected between two drivers which claimed
  two overlapping Io port regions. Driver Serial, with device
  &lt;\Device\Serial1.Translated&gt;, claimed an IO port range with starting
  address in data address 0x28 and 0x2c, and length in data address 0x30.

  Event ID: 24

  Description: A conflict has been detected between two drivers which claimed
  equivalent IRQs. Driver CCNTDRV, with device
  &lt;\Device\PointerPort0.Translated&gt;, claimed an interrupt with Level in
  data address 0x28, vector in data address 0x2c and Affinity in data address
  0x30.

  Event ID: 24
  Source: Serial
  Description: A conflict has been detected between two drivers which claimed
  equivalent IRQs. Driver Serial, with device
  &lt;\Device\Serial2.Translated&gt;, claimed an interrupt with Level in data
  address 0x28, vector in data address 0x2c and Affinity in data address 0x30.

NOTE: The COM ports, IRQ and addresses in system events mentioned above will vary
depending on the system configuration.

RESOLUTION
==========

The system events that appear in the Event Viewer are by design.

To correct the problem with the serial mouse:

1. Make sure that the Calcomp Digitizer drivers are installed by following the
  instructions included with the Calcomp drivers. Turn the digitizer power off
  and verify that the digitizer tablet is properly connected to the computer.

2. Verify that the settings of the serial mouse, the digitizer, and other
  hardware peripherals. Make sure that each device is using a unique IRQ, COM
  port and Base I/O port address. In Windows NT, run Control Panel Ports and
  select the COM port. Click Settings and then click Advanced to view the IRQ
  and Base I/O Port Address settings.

If there are no resource conflicts, proceed to step 3. If you have detected
resource conflicts (especially with the digitizer), contact Calcomp Technical
Support at (800) 458-5888 and see the following articles in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  ARTICLE-ID: Q112584
  TITLE : Error Messages Caused by Incorrect Serial Port Configuration

  ARTICLE-ID: Q137584
  TITLE : CalComp Digitizer Fails on Windows NT 3.51

1. In Control Panel Devices, verify that Serial has started.

2. In Control Panel Devices, select Sermouse and click Startup. For Startup
  Type, select System. Click OK and quit Control Panel.

3. Shut down and restart Windows NT.
