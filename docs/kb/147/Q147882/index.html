SUMMARY
=======

Some improvements have been made to the data control in Microsoft Visual Basic
version 4.0 and higher for Windows. One of these improvements is the capability
to assign back the results of a Recordset object to the data control itself.
This was not possible in Microsoft Visual Basic version 3.0 for Windows.

This article demonstrates how to assign a Table-type, Dynaset-type, or
Snapshot-type Recordset object back to a data control's Recordset property.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The OpenRecordset method has three possible types of records that it can
produce. Below is a portion of the Visual Basic Online Help that describes the
Openrecordset method that mentions these three types:

  dbOpenTable to open a table-type Recordset object.
  dbOpenDynaset to open a dynaset-type Recordset object.
  dbOpenSnapshot to open a snapshot-type Recordset object.

Also, the following was taken directly from Chapter 4 of the "Guide to Data
Access Objects" book contained in the "Professional Features" Visual Basic
manual:

  When you open a database using the data control, a Recordset object is
  automatically created based on the control's RecordSource property. You can
  address this Recordset with the following syntax:

  Data1.Recordset

All of the Recordset properties and methods discussed in this chapter can be used
with the data control's Recordset. In addition, you can assign the data
control's Recordset object to any Recordset variable you create. For example:

     Dim MyRecordset As Recordset
     Set MyRecordset = Data1.Recordset

Conversely, you can assign a Recordset object that you create programmatically or
with a data control to another data control, using the following syntax:

     Set Data1.Recordset = MyRecordset

When you assign a new Recordset object to the data control's Recordset property,
you must use the data control's Refresh method to rebuild the Recordset and
allow the data control to properly display it. In addition, you must make sure
that the DataField property of all bound controls attached to the data control
reflect valid fields in the new Recordset.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

1. Start Visual Basic or on the File menu, click New Project (ALT, F, N) if
  Visual Basic is already running. Form1 is created by default.

2. Add three command buttons (Command1, Command2, and Command3), add two text
  boxes (Text1, and Text2) and one data control to Form1.

3. Set the following properties:

  Default     Property          Value of Property
  -------------------------------------------------

  Command1    Caption          Assign Table-type
  Command2    Caption          Assign Dynaset-type
  Command3    Caption          Assign Snapshot-type
  Data1       DatabaseName     BIBLIO.MDB
  Data1       RecordSource     Titles
  Text1       DataSource       Data1
  Text1       Datafield        Title
  Text2       DataSource       Data1
  Text2       Datafield        Year Published

4. Add the following code to the Command1_Click event:

     Private Sub Command1_Click()
       Dim ws As Workspace
       Dim db As Database
       Dim tbl As Recordset
       Set ws = DBEngine.Workspaces(0)
       Set db = ws.OpenDatabase("Biblio.mdb")
       Set tbl = db.OpenRecordset("titles", dbOpenTable)
       Set Data1.Recordset = tbl
     End Sub

5. Add the following code to the Command2_Click event:

     Private Sub Command2_Click()
       Dim ws As Workspace
       Dim db As Database
       Dim rs As Recordset
       Set ws = DBEngine.Workspaces(0)
       Set db = ws.OpenDatabase("Biblio.mdb")
       Dim StrSQL As String
       StrSQL = "Select * from titles where title like 'a*' "
       Set rs = db.OpenRecordset(StrSQL, dbOpenDynaset)
       Set Data1.Recordset = rs
     End Sub

6. Add the following code to the Command3_Click event:

     Private Sub Command3_Click()
       Dim ws As Workspace
       Dim db As Database
       Dim sn As Recordset
       Set ws = DBEngine.Workspaces(0)
       Set db = ws.OpenDatabase("Biblio.mdb")
       Dim StrSQL As String
       StrSQL = "Select * from titles where title like 'the*' "
       Set sn = db.OpenRecordset(StrSQL, dbOpenSnapshot)
       Set Data1.Recordset = sn
     End Sub

7. On the Run menu, click Start (ALT, R, S), or press the F5 key to run the
  program. Click the Command1 button to view the records as a table-type
  Recordset, click the Command2 button to view the records as a Dynaset-type
  Recordset, or click the Command3 button to view the records as a
  Snapshot-type Recordset.
