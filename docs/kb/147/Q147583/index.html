-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 4.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows 95 
- Microsoft Windows 98 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Attempting to add more than one file in step 7 of the Visual Basic 4.0 Setup
Wizard fails. After selecting multiple files and clicking OK, the Setup Wizard
displays a dialog containing "This file may be required for your program to run
correctly" and prompts if a search for this file should be continued. If the
search is terminated, a dialog displays "The file(s) you selected were already
in the list. No new files have been added."

CAUSE
=====

The Setup Wizard attempts to look for a single file with a filename that is the
concatenation of all the files selected. This problem only occurs with the
16-bit version of the Microsoft Visual Basic 4.0 Setup Wizard for Windows when
run on Microsoft Windows 95 or Windows 98. It does not occur on Microsoft
Windows NT version 3.51 or on any 16-bit Microsoft Windows operating system.
This problem does not occur using the 32-bit version of the Microsoft Visual
Basic 4.0 Setup Wizard for Windows.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use any one of the following methods to work around this problem:

- Add each file one at a time.

- Create setup media or a template (.Vbz) file for the setup using an operating
  system other than Microsoft Windows 95. If a template is created on another
  machine, then the .Vbz file can be copied to the Microsoft Windows 95 or
  Windows 98 machine and selected in Step 1 of the Setup Wizard using the Load
  Template button.

- Add files manually to a template file generated on the Windows 95 or Windows
  98 machine. In step 7, click Save Template and save a template (.Vbz) file to
  disk. Open this template file in a text editor and manually add a line for
  each file that you want to add. Listed below are some sample added FileXX
  lines, just replace the first parameter with the path to the file you wish to
  include:

     File17=C:\ENROLL\ENROLL.ICO,0,$(AppPath),,|32760|,-1,0,0,0,,,0
     File18=C:\ENROLL\MSTRS.EXE,0,$(AppPath),,|32760|,-1,0,0,0,,,0
     File19=C:\ENROLL\README.HLP,0,$(AppPath),,|32760|,-1,0,0,0,,,0
     File20=C:\ENROLL\TRAIN.HLP,0,$(AppPath),,|32760|,-1,0,0,0,,,0

  Then restart the Setup Wizard and click Open Template to load the modified
  template file.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. We will post new information about this issue
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
