  Internal Error 416. Use Video for Windows version 1.1 or greater, not

CAUSE

  Q130786 Kids: Hangs at Black Screen or Quits After Microsoft Logo


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, do the following:

1. Exit MSB Ocean or MSB Earth.

2. Reinstall Video for Windows 1.1e.

  a. On the File menu in Program Manager, click Run.

  b. If you are using MSB Ocean, type the following in the Command Line box and
     click OK, where D is the drive letter of your CD-ROM drive:

  d:\vfw\setup.exe

     If you are using MSB Earth, type the following in the Command Line box and
     click OK, where D is the drive letter of your CD-ROM drive:

  d:\msbearth\setup16\vfw\setup.exe

     Follow the Setup instructions to complete installation.

3. Start MSB Ocean or MSB Earth.

Additional Troubleshooting Steps
--------------------------------

If you are still unable to run MSB Ocean, try the following troubleshooting
steps.

NOTE: The following steps involve creating, editing, renaming, and deleting files
and folders. For more information about how to accomplish these tasks in
Windows, see your Windows printed documentation or online Help.

1. In the \Windows\System folder on your hard drive, rename the following files:

  indeov.drv
  Ir21_r.dll
  Ir32.dll
  Mciavi.drv
  Msvidc.drv
  Msvideo.dll
  Msrle.drv

2. Delete the \MSKids\MSBOcean folder and reinstall MSB Ocean. If you're using
  MSB Earth, delete the \MSKids\MSBEarth folder and reinstall MSB Earth.

3. Restart Windows.

You should now be able to run MSB Ocean and/or MSB Earth successfully.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If the program still doesn't run, even after following the Additional
Troubleshooting Steps, your Windows Registry file may be damaged or corrupt. To
determine if the Registry is corrupted, do the following:

1. In the Windows folder, locate the file named Reg.dat.

2. Rename Reg.dat to Regdat.old.

  For more information about how to perform this task in Windows, see your
  Windows printed documentation or online Help.

3. Restart Windows.

4. Reinstall Video for Windows 1.1e.

  a. On the File menu in Program Manager, click Run.

  b. If you are using MSB Ocean, type the following in the Command Line box and
     click OK, where D is the drive letter of your CD-ROM drive:

  d:\vfw\setup.exe

     If you are using MSB Earth, type the following in the Command Line box and
     click OK, where D is the drive letter of your CD-ROM drive:

  d:\msbearth\setup16\vfw\setup.exe

     Follow the Setup instructions to complete installation.

5. Reinstall MSB Ocean or MSB Earth, and then run the program.

If the program runs correctly, then the original Reg.dat file was corrupted. To
make sure all of your other Windows programs run correctly, you should reinstall
them. This registers the programs in the newly created Reg.dat file. A corrupt
Reg.dat file can adversely affect the performance of all Windows applications.

For more information about rebuilding the Reg.dat file, please see the following
article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q80393 How to Rebuild the Default Windows REG.DAT File


If MSB Ocean continues to produce an error message or hang, then your Reg.dat
file was not corrupt. You should delete the Reg.dat file located in your Windows
folder, rename Regdat.old back to Reg.dat, and then exit and restart Windows to
restore your original settings.
