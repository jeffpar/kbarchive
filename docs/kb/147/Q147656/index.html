SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft has released an updated version of Microsoft Backup (Backup.exe
version 4.0.952) that corrects the following problems:

- If you have a tape drive installed in your computer and you click the Restore
  tab in Backup, click a backup set file, and then click Next Step, the Erase
  Tape command on the Tools menu may be available even if there is no tape in
  the tape drive. If you click the Erase Tape command and the backup set file
  that you selected is located on a floppy disk, hard disk, or network drive,
  all the data on the disk containing the backup set file may be erased.

- When you restore a backup set created with Backup, you may receive the
  following error message:

  Microsoft Backup has encountered a serious error in the Memory Manager. Quit
  Microsoft Backup and all other running programs, restart Backup, and then try
  again. If the problem persists, try reinstalling Backup.


For additional information about this error message and ways to resolve the
issue, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Please note that the updated version of Backup does not provide additional

(Backup.exe version 4.0.950).
