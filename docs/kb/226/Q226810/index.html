SYMPTOMS
========

When you are using the German keyboard character set, you are unable to enter a
backward slash character (\) during a remote control session.

CAUSE
=====

You have not enabled the System Key Pass-through option for your remote control
session, or you are unaware of the key sequence required to produce the backward
slash character when using the German language keyboard set.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, follow these steps:

1. Establish a remote control session with the client computer.

2. Click the "System Key Pass-through" button, which is the fourth button from
  the left on the right side of the remote control window.

3. On the remote client, click Start, and then click Run.

4. With the cursor in the Open box, type the following keys in sequence, holding
  them down until the last key is pressed:

          CTRL  +  ALT  +   hyphen

MORE INFORMATION
================

When working with keyboards set to languages other than U.S. English, the keys
may not map to the characters printed on them. To find the key combination
required to produce a character, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. Type "Char map.Exe" (without the quotation marks) in the Open box to start
  the Character Map.

3. Click the character you are trying to enter, and note the key sequence
  required to produce that character; the key sequence is displayed in the
  lower right pane of the Character Map window.
