-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An advertised package that is uninstalled on a client computer is not
re-advertised.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because Systems Management Server checks the
Winnt\MS\SMS\Clicomp\Apa\Data\Complete folder to see which advertised packages
have been installed on the client. If a package appears as complete, it will not
be re-advertised to the client.

WORKAROUND
==========

The following are alternative methods you can use to readvertise a specific
program to a client or collection:

- Delete the corresponding package that is located in the
  Winnt\MS\SMS\Clicomp\Apa\Data\Complete folder. CAUTION: This will remove all
  installation history.

- Send a new advertisement. This must occur using a new program ID. The new
  program can launch the same .exe file, but it must be a unique program with
  its own ID.

- Set up the advertisement for a recurring job. CAUTION: If the original
  advertisement was set to run "ASAP", this will not work. If the advertisement
  was initially set to run under a schedule that is forward in time to begin
  with, this will work as desired.
