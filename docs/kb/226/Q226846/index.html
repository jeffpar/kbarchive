-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a domain account is specified for the Software Metering service, and
Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) is installed on a member server, the
domain account that is entered is converted to a local machine account on the
member server.

To demonstrate this behavior, follow these steps:

1. In the SMS Administrator Console, click Site Systems under Site Settings.
  Right-click a member server, and then click Properties.

2. In the member server Site System Properties box, on the Software Metering
  Server tab, click to select the "Use this site system as a software metering
  server" check box.

3. Enter a Service account using the following syntax:

  DOMAIN\SWMAccount

4. Navigate to SMS_License_Server under Services in Control Panel.

Note that the account is changed from a domain account to a local account. For
example, Domain\SWMAccount is changed to SWMAccount.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, create a domain account with attributes that exactly
match the account on the member server. Provided that all attributes match
exactly, pass-through authentication should enable this service to log on to the
domain.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
