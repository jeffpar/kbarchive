-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an advertised program directs Systems Management Server to restart the
client, the Available Program Manager (APM) scheduler may fail to detect the
shutdown and instead start a new program.

When the shutdown is finally detected, the advertisement is cancelled, and no
programs are executed.

When a job is executed, the status or return code is stored in the
Ms\Sms\Clicomp\Apa\Data\Complete directory. The executed jobs are stored as text
files in this directory with a name composed of the package ID and a numerical
extension (index), for example:

  F1200007.000

When a job is cancelled, the value stored in LastRunStatus within each text file
in the Data\Complete directory is 0x12. To work around this problem, ensure that
no restart is requested (when possible).

CAUSE
=====

The shutdown event is improperly detected by the APM.

WORKAROUND
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server 2.0. For additional information, click the following article number to
view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Systems Management Server 2.0.
This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack
Service Pack 1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can determine the version of APM that your clients are using by doing either
of the following:

- On your site server, open the Compver.ini file in the
  Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Smsapm32 directory. If this file lists version number
  2.00.1239.0020 or later, you do not need the fix.

- On the Systems Management Server client, double-click the Systems Management
  icon in Control Panel and then click the Components tab. If the version
  number of the Available Programs Manager is 2.00.1239.0020 or later, you do
  not need the fix.
