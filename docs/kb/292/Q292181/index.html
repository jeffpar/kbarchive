-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Consolidation of the Company Name property that is collected by Systems
Management Server (SMS) version 2.0 software inventory into a single company
name is limited to no more than 32 different inventory names for each displayed
name.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem in instances where there are more than 32 variations
of a company name, you can configure a second display name to hold an additional
32 names. Note that this display name cannot be identical to the first display
name you specify.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When an SMS 2.0 software inventory collects its data, it analyzes the properties
of each file of the type you specified to be inventoried. You can manually view
these properties by right-clicking on a file and then clicking Properties. One
of the properties that is collected by a software inventory is the publisher
name, and this property is returned as the company name. You can configure SMS
to summarize this data and consolidate different representations of the company
name into a single instance. For example, some files that are published by
Microsoft have a Company property of Microsoft, while others may have a Company
property of Microsoft Corp.

You can configure the consolidation of this information by:

1. Double-click the following items:

   - Site Hierarchy

   - Site Code

   - Site Settings

   - Client Agents

   - Software Inventory Client Agent

   - Properties

2. Click the Inventory Names tab, and then type a single display name. Note that
  you can also specify a maximum of 32 entries under Inventoried Names.

If you try to type more than 32 entries, you receive the following error
message:

  You can have a maximum of 32 Inventoried names for this display name. Before
  you can add this inventoried name you must delete one or more other
  inventoried names.

In addition, the Software Inventory agent is case-sensitive, but the Software
Inventory Agent property is not. Because of this, changes in the case of the
company name are recognized as unique instances. For example, Microsoft is
interpreted as an entry that is different from MICROSOFT. If you attempt to add
the same name in this manner, you receive the following error message:

  An error occurred updating the database. Some of the rules you have entered
  conflict with existing rules.
