SYMPTOMS
========

When you advertise programs to Microsoft Windows 95-based or to Microsoft
Windows 98-based client computers that must be restarted, you may receive a "no
success" or a "failure status" message in the Status Message Viewer. When you
examine the Cqmgr32.log file on the client, you may receive the following log
after the client is restarted:

  -Servicing Destination[CAP List for site W2K,statmsgs.box\]
  Destination[CAP List for site W2K,statmsgs.box\] is inaccessible
  -Destination[CAP List for site W2K,statmsgs.box\] retry set to 1
  Copy cycle finished normally
  Starting Copy Cycle no. 2
  'OK to Process' event unsignalled
  -Servicing Destination[CAP List for site W2K,statmsgs.box\]
  -Destination[CAP List for site W2K,statmsgs.box\] not yet ready for retry
  -Destination[CAP List for site W2K,statmsgs.box\] retry set to 1
  Copy cycle finished normally

NOTE: You must replace the preceding "W2K" site code with the client-assigned
site code.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur when the After Running option is set to Program restarts
Computer in the Properties section of the advertised program, and if the program
requests that the client must be restarted. This problem only occurs when the
program successfully creates a status .mif file. Typically, this problem occurs
in environments where users tend to turn off their computers before they leave
the office.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, use either of the following methods:

- Rewrite or modify the advertised program, if possible, to suppress the
  restart process and to change the After Running option to SMS Restarts
  Computer in the Properties section of the advertised program.

- Ensure that users do not turn off their computers when they leave the office.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

On some clients, Copy Queue Manager may not be able to initialize correctly upon
startup, which can produce an inaccessible connection to a client access point.
When the new success status message item is submitted to Copy Queue Manager
moments later, the message is not successfully copied to the client access
point, but the message can remain in the queue and can be retried after the next
wake-up cycle of Copy Queue Manager.

The default Copy Queue Manager cycle is 1380 minutes (23 hours). Users who tend
to turn off their computers when they leave the office never enable this wake-up
cycle to reach its schedule. A new Copy Queue Manager cycle can occur after a
subsequent restart of the client, but the cycle is likely to be unsuccessful
because of the same initialization failure which caused the initial problem. As
a consequence, the Copy Queue Manager item is deleted after its configured item
lifetime which by default is set to every 11520 minutes (eight days).

If the advertised program does not report a status .mif file, refer to the
related article:
