Problem:

I am compiling my C program for protected-mode with the command:

cl /Lp demo.c

I'm using the Microsoft Segmented-Executable Linker Version
5.01.04, but at link-time I get about 10 unresolved externals,
all of which are OS/2 API calls such as DOSWRITE, DOSCLOSE,
DOSEXIT.

If I link in the library DOSCALLS.LIB, as follows, the problem is
corrected:

cl /Lp demo.c doscalls.lib

The manual does not state that DOSCALLS.LIB must be explicitly linked.

Response:

This problem occurs because you are using the wrong version of the
Microsoft Segmented-Executable Linker. You should be using Version
5.01.21, which was distributed with C Version 5.10. Version 5.01.04 is
the OS/2 linker.

You must link in DOSCALLS.LIB with Version 5.01.04 because this
version of LINK does not have the ability to bring in libraries that
are themselves requested by a library.

The library xLIBCyP.LIB (where x is the memory model and y is the math
package) contains a request for DOSCALLS.LIB. Link Version 5.01.21
understands this request and searches for DOSCALLS.LIB in the
directories specified in the LIB environment variable; LINK Version
5.01.04 does not understand this request.
