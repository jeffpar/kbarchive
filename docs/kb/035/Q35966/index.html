You cannot directly add, delete, or modify routines in an existing
Quick library (.QLB file). However, you can easily re-create Quick
libraries using a parallel .LIB file.  You can add, delete, or modify
routines in the .LIB file using the Library Manager (LIB.EXE) utility,
as shown below under "More Information". You can then convert the .LIB
file into a .QLB Quick library file with the /Q option of the linker
(LINK.EXE).

This article applies to Microsoft QuickBASIC Versions 4.00, 4.00b, and
4.50 and to the QuickBASIC that comes with the Microsoft BASIC
Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS and MS OS/2. This also
applies to QBX.EXE which is supplied with Microsoft BASIC PDS Version
7.00 for MS-DOS and MS OS/2.

To "add" an .OBJ module to a .QLB file, you must first add the module
to your parallel .LIB file with the Library Manager (LIB.EXE), as
follows:

   LIB YourLib.LIB + YourMod.OBJ;

If the module already exists in the library, but you want to replace
it with your new module, use the following command:

   LIB YourLib.LIB -+ NewMod.OBJ;

To remove a module from your library, first remove it from your .LIB
file with the following:

   LIB YourLib.LIB - YourMod;

This will delete the module completely. If you want to keep a copy of
the .OBJ file, you can create one as you delete it from your library
with the following:

   LIB YourLib.LIB -* YourMod;

You can also combine entire libraries using LIB.EXE, as follows:

   LIB FirstLib.LIB + NextLib.LIB;

This will "add" the routines in NextLib.LIB to the FirstLib.LIB file.

Once you have modified your .LIB files as you wish, you can create a
Quick library from the .LIB file with the following LINK command line:

   LINK /Q YourLib.LIB, QuickLib.QLB, NUL, BQLB41.LIB;

When making a Quick library, BQLB40.LIB is required (instead of
BQLB41.LIB) for QuickBASIC Version 4.00. BQLB41.LIB is required for
QuickBASIC Version 4.00b, or the QuickBASIC which comes with the BASIC
Compiler Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS and MS OS/2 or BASIC PDS
7.00 for MS-DOS and MS OS/2. The BQLB4x.LIB file comes on the release
disk.
