How to Keep the Editor from Saving Backup Files

The text switch "Backup" determines what happens to old copies of
files that are modified. If you do not wish to keep any backup files,
a value of "none" can be given, as follows:

   Backup:none

Backup files can be saved in two ways. A value of "bak" will save the
previous version of the file with a .BAK extension. A value of "undel"
will save a history of old copies of your file in a hidden directory
disk space.

Older copies can be restored by using UNDEL.EXE. Typing "undel" will
list all the backup copies; "undel &lt;filename&gt;" will either restore the
file, or if there is more than one backup, it will allow you to choose
which version you would like to restore. Because these files take up
actual disk space, they should be periodically removed from the disk
by using EXP.EXE. Typing "exp" will delete these files permanently.
