The following information is taken from an application note called
"Microsoft Editor Questions and Answers." The application note also is
available from Microsoft Product Support Services by calling (206)
454-2030.

"Unable to Open Swapping File c:\temp\m-0029.vm No Such File or
Directory" Error

The editor assumes that environment variables are set so that
important editor information can be loaded from and saved to your
disk. The following is an example:

   SET INIT=c:\init
   SET TMP=c:\temp

In this example, c:\temp would be the directory that would hold
temporary or swapping files, usually named M-0029.VM. This file is
used to allow the editor to switch to previous files. C:\INIT would
hold TOOLS.INI and M.TMP. The swapping file also would be stored here
if the TMP variable was not set. If neither of these variables is
set, the swapping file would be stored in the root directory and M.TMP
would be stored in the current directory.

However, if the TMP variable is set to a directory that does not
exist, or if extra characters were included after the "p" in "c:\temp"
such as a space or a semicolon, the swapping file will not be created
and the error above will be generated.
