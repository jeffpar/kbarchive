Making Separate TOOLS.INI Entries for M if You Want to Have Different
Configurations for M Running Under DOS, OS/2 Real Mode, or OS/2
Protected Mode, or a Combination of the Three

Various combinations of tags can be used in TOOLS.INI to set up
different configurations for different environments. Each environment
has its own recognized tag. The following is an example:

Environment:                  Tag:

MS-DOS                        [M-3.30] (your particular
                                       DOS version)
OS/2 real mode                [M-10.0R]
OS/2 protected mode           [M-10.0]

The following is an examples of combinations:

MS-DOS and OS/2 real mode     [M-3.30 M-10.0R]
OS/2 real and protected mode  [M-10.0R M-10.0]

If you have renamed M.EXE, the "M" used in the tag must be replaced
with the name you are using for the editor. However, each M-XX.XX
sub-tag only can appear once in a tag. For example, if you used the
double tags above, and you were running M in OS/2 real mode, only the
information from first tag would be loaded.

By using these tags, only certain sections will be loaded from
TOOLS.INI to initialize the editor, depending on the environment in
which the editor is running. The statements in the [M] section are
always loaded.
