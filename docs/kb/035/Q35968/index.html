This article provides an example of calling BASIC's SetUEvent routine
from an assembly-language interrupt routine to disable the screen dump
performed by the PRINT SCREEN key (found on enhanced IBM keyboards) or
the SHIFT+PRSCR or SHIFT+PRTSC key (found on earlier, nonenhanced IBM
PC keyboards).

Special steps must be taken when triggering BASIC's user-defined
events from assembly-language interrupt routines. Primarily, the
assembly routine needs to make sure that the DS register points to
BASIC's default data segment before making the call to SetUEvent.
Also, the interrupt routine should be disabled before, and re-enabled
after, a CHAIN or RUN statement. This information applies to Microsoft
QuickBASIC Versions 4.00b and 4.50, to Microsoft BASIC Compiler
Versions 6.00 and 6.00b for MS-DOS and MS OS/2, and to Microsoft BASIC
PDS Version 7.00 for MS-DOS and MS OS/2.

Note: The SetUEvent routine is not provided in QuickBASIC Version 4.00
or earlier. SetUEvent was introduced in QuickBASIC Version 4.00b and
the BASIC compiler Version 6.00 and later.

BASIC user-defined interrupts are triggered by a call to SetUEvent.
This routine can be called from an external assembly routine, usually
an interrupt handler. However, in QuickBASIC 4.00b, in the BASIC
compiler 6.00 and 6.00b, and in BASIC PDS 7.00, SetUEvent assumes that
DS is pointing to BASIC's default data segment; if it isn't, the call
to SetUEvent will not trigger the BASIC interrupt routine. To ensure
that DS is pointing to the correct place, save the value of DS in a
location accessible to the interrupt routine when installing it. Then,
in the interrupt routine, place that value in DS directly before
making the call to SetUEvent. In QuickBASIC Version 4.50, you don't
have to set DS equal to the BASIC Data Segment.

When CHAINing or RUNning other BASIC programs that use the same
interrupt routine, the first BASIC program must deinstall the
interrupt handler, CHAIN (or RUN) the second program, and reinstall
the handler again. The sample program below demonstrates how to
install, deinstall, and properly CALL SetUEvent in an interrupt
handler situation.

The following is a BASIC code example:

DECLARE SUB PrScr ()
DECLARE SUB DeInst ()
ON UEVENT GOSUB handler
UEVENT ON
CALL PrScr
PRINT "Screen Dump interrupt has been disabled."
PRINT "Press PRINT SCREEN (or SHIFT+PRTSC) key to trigger event."
PRINT "Press any other key to end program."
WHILE i$ = ""
  i$ = INKEY$
WEND
CALL DeInst
PRINT "Screen Dump interrupt has been re-enabled."
END
handler:
  PRINT "Screen dumps are currently disabled."
  RETURN

The following is an assembly-language program that redefines the
interrupt that occurs when you press the PRINT SCREEN (or SHIFT+PRTSC)
key:
