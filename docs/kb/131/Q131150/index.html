- Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Once the Microsoft Mail Gateway to SMTP is functional, several factors still
need to be addressed before the gateway can be expected to perform reliably. If
these factors are overlooked, the gateway may intermittently hang and refuse
inbound connections.

The configuration issues listed below are usually involved if the gateway stops
working with no error messages recorded in the SMTPGATE.LOG file, and the
following message is repeatedly displayed in this file:

  Spawning SMTPGET
  Spawn(SMTPGET)=0
  Idling: 48258 bytes, largest 47234

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following five configuration issues are known for hindering the reliability
of the SMTP gateway.

1. Postoffice (PO) and Gateway should be on the same physical network.

  Because the gateway's temporary files are written on the postoffice
  (M:\MAILDATA\SMTP\), and not its local hard disk, the performance of the
  gateway is dependent on file input/output. The most effective way to ensure
  fast file input/output is to have both the gateway and postoffice on the same
  physical network.

2. Use a Mail Relay Host for inbound SMTP mail.

  It is not mandatory to have Mail Relay Host configured for inbound mail, but
  it is highly recommended. Because the SMTP gateway is dependent on a DOS
  redirector, and the reliability of a UNIX to DOS connection is not as robust
  as the reliability of a UNIX to UNIX connection (UNIX is multithreaded; DOS
  is single threaded), it is recommended to control the required UNIX to DOS
  connection by storing all messages destine for MS Mail on a Host before they
  get forwarded to MS Mail.

  In other words, the Mail Administrators need to have as much control over the
  less reliable UNIX to DOS connection as possible. The optimum way to control
  this is by putting a Mail Relay Host on the same network segment as the
  gateway and PO server. Not only does this increase the reliability of the
  UNIX to DOS connection from a physical perspective, but it allows the Host to
  be configured to open/close the connections more effectively.

3. Have routers use static routing.

  If the Smart Host (Mail Relay Host) is not on the same network segment as the
  gateway and PO, then static routes should be configured on the router that
  separates the gateway and host. The IP addresses for the Gateway and the
  Smart Host should be added to the static table on the router.

  NOTE: Most routers use dynamic routing by default; a static table needs to be
  manually created and maintained.

4. Use a 16-bit Network Interface Card (NIC).

  You should use a 16-bit NIC to get fast file input/output. Additionally, it is
  recommended to use a 16-bit NIC with the RAM disabled.

5. Use one protocol per NIC (IPX/SPX).

  When the postoffice is on a Novell NetWare server and IPX/SPX is used to
  access the postoffice when TCP/IP is used to access the Host, it might be
  necessary to isolate each protocol on a separate NIC.
