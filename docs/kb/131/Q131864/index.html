The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error message appears when you run Microsoft Mail and choose
Postoffice Manager from the Mail menu.

  The postoffice is already being managed by. Try again later.

CAUSE
=====

The Mail Postoffice Manager attempts to open FLAG.GLB for exclusive access
before displaying the Postoffice Manager window to determine if the postoffice
is already being managed. Any one of the following conditions can cause the
error noted above:

- Another Mail user has already opened this file for exclusive access by
  running another instance of the Postoffice Administrator, or is in the
  process of creating a new account on the workgroup postoffice as part of the
  Mail initialization procedure.

- You do not have the appropriate file permissions to open the FLAG.GLB file.
  The workgroup postoffice is on an Windows NT file system (NTFS) partition and
  you do not have the appropriate permissions to open FLAG.GLB file. All
  Microsoft Mail users must have Full Control permission to the workgroup
  postoffice directory (WGPO by default) and all of its subdirectories and
  files.

- The read-only file attribute is set on FLAG.GLB.

- FLAG.GLB is locked by the workgroup postoffice server, because there is
  another exclusive open request against this file that has not yet been
  closed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Another Mail User is Using the Postoffice for Administrative Purposes
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If another Mail user is using the postoffice for administrative purposes, either
wait for the other Mail user to complete the postoffice administrative session,
or have the other Mail user terminate the administrative session. To find out
who currently has this file open:

- Run File Manager, select the FLAG.GLB file, choose Properties from the File
  menu, and then choose Open By.

  -or-

- Run Control Panel, choose Server, and then choose In Use.

You Do Not Have the Appropriate File Permissions to Open the FLAG.GLB File
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you do not have the appropriate file permissions to open FLAG.GLB:

1. Run File Manager on the workgroup postoffice server

2. Select FLAG.GLB.

3. From the Security menu, choose Permissions.

4. Add your user account or a group to which you belong (for example,
  Mailusers). The account of group must have the Full Control permission. Make
  sure the user account or group does not have the No Access permission
  assigned to FLAG.GLB.

5. Choose OK.

The Read-Only File Attribute is Set on FLAG.GLB
-----------------------------------------------

If read-only file attribute is set on the FLAG.GLB file:

1. Run File Manager on the workgroup postoffice server.

2. Select FLAG.GLB.

3. From the File menu, choose Properties.

4. Clear the Read-Only check box.

5. Choose OK.

FLAG.GLB is Locked
------------------

If the FLAG.GLB file is currently locked:

1. Run File Manager.

2. Select FLAG.GLB and choose Properties from the File menu

3. Choose Open By.

  session is not established to the file. You can corrupt files if you close
  them while they are being used.

5. In the Network Properties window, choose Open By for the user who has this
  file open.

6. Choose Close Selected to close the file.

7. Choose OK.

-or-
