SYMPTOMS
========

An application uses the RUNTIME_CLASS macro to obtain a pointer to the
CRuntimeClass associated with a class implemented in an extension DLL. When that
pointer is used, an access violation or other unexpected behavior occurs.

CAUSE
=====

The CRuntimeClass data member of the class is not properly declared as imported
data.

For example, this error occurs if the CRuntimeClass object is exported via the
DLL's module definition (.def) file, but AFX_DATA is not defined as
__declspec(dllimport). This must be done in the header file containing the class
declaration when the .exe file that imports the class is built. This enables the
linker to resolve the reference to the CRuntimeClass using the import library
for the DLL, so no build-time errors occur. However, the code generated by the
compiler doesn't use the import table to determine the address of the item.

RESOLUTION
==========

Ensure that AFX_DATA is defined as __declspec(dllimport) when including the
class header file in code for the module that imports the class from the DLL.
See the "Sample Code" section of this article for a detailed example.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The DECLARE_DYNAMIC macro declares a CRuntimeClass object as follows:

     static AFX_DATA CRuntimeClass class##class_name;

Therefore, defining AFX_DATA as __declspec(dllimport) affects the declaration of
that object. The rest of this section describes why it is important to do so.

The RUNTIME_CLASS macro is defined in afx.h as follows:

     #define RUNTIME_CLASS(class_name) (&amp;class_name::class##class_name)

In other words, this macro returns the address of the static CRuntimeClass member
added to the class by the DECLARE_DYNAMIC macro or one of its cousins
(DECLARE_SERIAL or DECLARE_DYNCREATE).

Here is some disassembled (X86) code from an .exe file that uses a class named
CMyClass, which it imports from an extension DLL. The extension DLL uses its
module definition file to export the members of the class, and the header file
does not declare the class or any of its members as imported.

m_pMyClass has just been initialized as follows:

     m_pMyClass = new CMyClass;
  138:      ASSERT( m_pMyClass-&gt;IsKindOf(RUNTIME_CLASS(CMyClass)));
  00401a9e   push      00402648
  00401aa3   mov       eax,dword ptr [this]
  00401aa6   mov       ecx,dword ptr [eax+000000d8]
  00401aac   call      ?IsKindOf@CObject@@QBEHPBUCRuntimeClass@@@Z ...

The code fails the assertion.

Here is the disassembly of the same code when the header file defines AFX_DATA as
__declspec(dllimport):

  138:      ASSERT( m_pMyClass-&gt;IsKindOf(RUNTIME_CLASS(CMyClass)) );
  00401a95   mov       eax,dword ptr
   [_imp_?classCMyClass@CMyClass@@2UCRuntimeClass@@A (00406598)]
  00401a9a   push      eax
  00401a9b   mov       eax,dword ptr [this]
  00401a9e   mov       ecx,dword ptr [eax+000000d8]
  00401aa4   call      ?IsKindOf@CObject@@QBEHPBUCRuntimeClass@@@Z ...

This code sequence passes the assertion, as expected.

Notice the difference in the way the stack is set up prior to the call to
IsKindOf, especially the first item pushed. In the second case, eax is loaded
with the address of an item located through the import table, while in the first
case, a direct value is used.

Sample Code
-----------

  /* Compile options needed: None
  */ 

  // MYCLASS.H
  //   The following class declaration illustrates the CORRECT
  //   way to declare the AFX_DATA symbol when exporting a class
  //   from an extension DLL

  #undef  AFX_DATA
  #define AFX_DATA AFX_EXT_CLASS

  class CMyClass : public CObject
  {
    DECLARE_DYNAMIC()

    // ... other class members omitted for clarity
  };

  #undef  AFX_DATA
  #define AFX_DATA

  // end of header file
