SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to start Encarta 1995, you may receive the following error
message:

  Encarta can't find the files needed to start. Either the CD is not inserted,
  or the path to the files is incorrect. To correct this, insert the CD or run
  Installer again"

After you press OK, another error message appears:

  Application "unknown" has unexpectedly quit because an error of type 28
  occurred

RESOLUTION
==========

Try one of the following resolutions.

Resolution 1
------------

If you installed Encarta 1995 to a disk drive other than the drive that has your
system folder, restarting your computer should remove the source of the error
messages. If you installed Encarta to the drive with the system folder on it,
delete the Encarta 1994 and 1995 preference files from the System:Preference
Folder and restart Encarta.

-or-

Resolution 2
------------

The Macintosh has a limit of 128 font suitcases. If Encarta is installed on a
Macintosh that already has 128 suitcases, the Encarta fonts will not be
installed; however, no warning will be given. If you then try to run Encarta,
you get the same error message described above.

To correct this problem, reduce the number of font suitcases and reinstall
Encarta.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The correct procedure for installing Encarta 1995, according to Section 6 of the
Encarta 1995 ReadMe file is included below. Consult your Encarta ReadMe file
fore information.

ReadMe File Section 6: Where Encarta Installer Puts Files
---------------------------------------------------------

The Encarta Installer program creates folders and copies files to several
locations. When you install Encarta '95, the Installer program:

- Creates a folder on your hard disk called "Encarta '95" and copies the
  following to it:

  Microsoft Encarta '95 - the main Encarta application.

  Encarta '95 Read Me - the document you are reading now.

  Encarta &amp; Memory - a Read Me document explaining memory issues and
  troubleshooting.

  Animation Launcher - used to run animations in low memory situations.

  Animation - a file used by Encarta in playing of animations.

  Encarta Projector - Macromedia application that plays Director movies.

  SimpleText - a text editor that allows you to view the ReadMe files.

  Data Files - folder that contains data files needed by Encarta.

  Microsoft System Information - folder with applications that may be required
  if you need product support from Microsoft.

  InterActivities - a folder containing aliases to the InterActivities and
  MindMaze

- Creates a folder called "Encarta '95 Preferences" in your System:Preferences
  folder

- Creates a folder called "Encarta '94 Preferences" in your System:Preferences
  folder, this is created to enable Microsoft Works 4.0 to work together with
  Encarta '95. This folder will not be created if Encarta '94 is already
  installed on your system.

- Copies QuickTime Powerplug to your System:Extensions folder. This is only
  necessary for PowerMac systems; it can be removed from other systems.

- Copies QuickTime 2.0, QuickTime Musical Instruments, and Sound Manager to the
  System:Extensions folder (if needed). These are necessary to play video and
  sound.

- Copies FIF Component to the System:Extensions folder. This is necessary to
  load images from the CD.

- Copies Apple Multimedia Tuner to the System:Extensions folder. This allows
  the multimedia in Encarta to run properly.

- Copies Sound Manager Sound control panel to the System:Control Panels folder
  (if needed).

- Copies Times, Arial, MS Reference, and Symbol fonts to System folder.

On System 7.0 and 7.0.1, these fonts are copied to the System suitcase. On System
7.1 or higher these fonts are copied to the Fonts folder.

If you choose to switch disks before installing (to a hard disk that is not your
startup volume) you MUST RESTART YOUR MACINTOSH before Encarta will run
correctly. On System 7.0 and 7.0.1, installing to a non-boot drive will not
properly install the necessary fonts. It is also possible that the installer
will not install the program to a non-boot drive on some systems. To resolve
these problems, try installing to your boot drive, then drag the Encarta '95
folder to the desired drive.
