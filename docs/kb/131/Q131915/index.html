The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

In versions 3.2 and 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, when you use the
EXTERNAL.EXE program to connect dynamically to a Novell server, and that server
is the Novell server that validates the user account on your network, the server
will not disconnect the session that EXTERNAL.EXE creates.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The workstation that runs EXTERNAL.EXE connects to the Novell network, and the
workstation shell then sends out a NetWare Core Protocol Language (NCP) request
for an active Novell server to validate the user account.

When a server responds, the shell establishes a Not Logged In connection on that
server. If EXTERNAL.EXE dynamically connects to the server to deliver messages
to a postoffice there, the connection changes to the account name used by the
workstation. When EXTERNAL.EXE subsequently dynamically disconnects from the
server, the connection at the workstation is terminated (the drive letter used
by EXTERNAL.EXE is unmapped) but the server keeps the connection open with the
account name, not Not Logged In.

This is normal behavior for Novell, because the server must maintain a connection
in order to continue to validate the user account.

NOTE: The shell and Novell NetWare communicate using a language called NetWare
Core Protocol (NCP). NCP is used for all client requests for service and for the
responses to those requests. NCP is the single most important application layer
protocol that NetWare provides. Without NCP, none of the file services offered
by NetWare would be possible.
