-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS, versions 1.0, 1.0a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft FORTRAN PowerStation for MS-DOS and Windows is designed to work
optimally with Microsoft Windows version 3.1. Under Windows 95, there are
problems with graphics programs. A simple workaround is described in this
article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Problem Corrected: Graphics Programs Fail
-----------------------------------------

Graphics programs compiled with FORTRAN PowerStation fail when run. Instead of
the usual graphics output, you see a runtime error:

  run-time error F6996
  - DOS graphics not supported under Windows NT

The cause of this problem is that Windows 95 is running the graphics program as a
Win32-based application, instead of as a DOS-extended program. Graphics are not
supported from a console application, so the program fails.

The workaround is to obtain the FPSFIX95.EXE patch. It marks the executable file
so that Windows 95 treats it as a DOS-extended program, not a Win32- based
application.

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  fpsfix95.exe
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/fortranps10ados/patch1/1/DOS/EN-US/fpsfix95.exe)

How to Install the Fix
----------------------

First, make sure you are using the maintenance release of Microsoft FORTRAN
PowerStation.

To see if you are using version 1.0a, run LINK.EXE from the bin directory. If the
linker version is 2.8, you have FORTRAN Powerstation version 1.0. If the linker
version is 1.0F, you have FORTRAN Powerstation version 1.0a. If you do not have
version 1.0a, please contact Microsoft Product Support Services for your area at
the number listed in your documentation. If you live in the United States or
Canada, this number is (425) 635-7015.

Run the SETUP.BAT included in the patch. It installs FPSFIX so that all programs
compiled are automatically updated. If you have any graphics programs that are
already compiled, you can run FPSFIX yourself with the command:

  fpsfix &lt;exename&gt;.exe

Here &lt;exename&gt; is the name of your executable file. Executables built with
this fix in place can still be used on MS-DOS and Windows version 3.1 systems.
