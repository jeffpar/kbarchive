SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a new document or open an existing document in PowerPoint or
Publisher for Windows, the text on the screen may appear to be very small. The
appearance of the text will not change, even if you try to change it to a
different font or point size.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when there is no Windows default printer selected, or if a
printer driver is installed that does not support TrueType fonts. Some printer
drivers that don't support TrueType fonts are: the Generic Text- Only (TTY)
driver, Windows 3.0 printer drivers, and some FAX drivers.

Both Publisher and PowerPoint use the printer driver to determine the appearance
and placement of fonts on the screen as well as on the printer. Without a
printer that supports TrueType fonts, both programs will substitute Windows
screen fonts for actual TrueType fonts, thereby giving the appearance of tiny
fonts on the screen.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct the problem, set a TrueType-compatible printer as your default
printer. To do so, follow these steps (these instructions apply to Windows
3.1):

1. From your Main group in Program Manager, double-click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Printers.

3. If you have already have a suitable printer in your Installed Printers list,
  do the following:
  a. Click the printer entry.

  b. Click "Set As Default Printer."

  This will set the printer as your default printer.

4. If you do not have a suitable printer, perform the following steps:
  a. Make sure you have your Windows installation disks on hand, as these steps
     will require that you use at least one or more of them.

  b. In the Control Panel Printers dialog box, click Add.

  c. Scroll through the list of printers until you find a suitable printer,
     click it to select it, and click OK.
     NOTE: You do not need a printer physically attached to your computer to use
     the driver for it. For instance, if you know that you will be printing
     your Publisher publication on an HP LaserJet IIIsi, then install that
     printer driver, even though you may not have that printer actually
     attached.

  d. Control Panel will prompt you for the appropriate disk(s) to be inserted
     into your floppy disk drive. After the necessary files are copied, the new
     printer will appear in the Installed Printers list.

  e. Once the printer is installed, perform step 3 above.

Once you have done the above, the appearance of text in both PowerPoint and
Publisher should appear normal.
