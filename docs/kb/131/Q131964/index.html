-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following procedures allow you to update a Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0
Service Pack 2 or Service Pack 3 client installation point with Microsoft
Exchange Server Service Pack 4 binary files. If you have already updated your
client installation point with Service Pack 3 binaries, you can use this same
procedure to update it to Service Pack 4 by following the second set of
instructions below.

This allows new users to run the client Setup once and have all the fixes in
Service Pack 4 on their workstation. This also allows an existing Microsoft
Exchange Server 4.0 RTM user to run client Setup just once (instead of twice) to
update the workstation with all of the Service Pack 2 and Service Pack 4 binary
files.

NOTE: Microsoft Exchange Service Pack 4 has cumulative fixes based on Service
Pack 2. Therefore, all fixes in Service Pack 3 are also included in Service Pack
4.

These procedures are very detailed and require a lot of editing by the System
Administrator. It is easy to make an editing mistake, so take your time and
double-check your changes. These procedures will work for all client platforms
and languages. Thorough testing is recommended before making this installation
point available to your users.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To update a Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 Service Pack 2 Client installation
point with Microsoft Exchange Client Service Pack 4 binary files:

1. Create a Microsoft Exchange Server SP2 Client Administration share on your
  network by using setup /a. This provides all the binary files in expanded
  form and eliminates the CAB files. Name the directory Sp2.mod.

2. Run Setup Editor (if you have done so in the past) and do your normal
  modifications.

3. In a separate directory on your network, copy the contents of the Service
  Pack 4 client directory that matches the client you set up in Step 1. Name
  the directory Sp4.org.

4. Copy the Extract.exe and Sp4extrt.bat files from the \Support directory of
  the Service Pack 4 compact disc to the Sp4.org directory.

5. From the Sp4.org directory, run Sp4extrt.bat. This will create an
  \Sp4.org\Rawsp4 directory and will place all the extracted Service Pack 4
  binary files there.

6. Using your favorite text editor, open \Sp2.mod\Exchng.inf and
  \Sp4.org\Rawsp4\Exchng.inf.

7. For each line listed in \Sp4.org\Rawsp4\Exchng.inf, make the corresponding
  date, size, and version changes in \Sp2.mod\Exchng.inf. If the file doesn't
  exist in \Sp2.mod\Exchng.inf, skip it. Don't do a complete line copy; this
  will break Setup.

  VERY IMPORTANT! Only change the date, the size (if it changes), and the
  version. Be careful not to delete commas or additional fields.

8. After your modifications are complete, save it to its original location and
  close the text editor.

9. Replace the files in Sp2.mod with the corresponding files in \Sp4.org\Rawsp4.

10. Replace the files in \Sp2.mod\System with the corresponding files in
  \Sp4.org\Rawsp4. This will be most, but not all, of the remaining Service
  Pack 4 files. It may be easiest to do this in File Manager with two windows,
  each sorted by name. To ensure that you are able to see all files, do the
  following:

  a. In File Manager, click Options on the View menu.

  b. Click Show All Files and then click OK.

  c. Select the corresponding Service Pack 4 files and drag them to the
     appropriate directory.

You are now ready to test your client installation.

NOTE: Extract.exe is a Win16 utility.


To update a Microsoft Exchange Server 4.0 Service Pack 3 Client installation
point with Microsoft Exchange Client Service Pack 4 binary files:

1. Copy your Service Pack 3 client installation point to a new directory called
  Sp3.mod.

2. In a separate directory on your network, copy the contents of the SP4 client
  directory that matches the client installation you copied in step 1. Call the
  directory Sp4.org.

3. Copy the Extract.exe and Sp4extrt.bat files from the \Support directory of
  the Service Pack 4 compact disc to the Sp4.org directory.

4. From the Sp4.org directory, run Sp4extrt.bat. This will create an
  \Sp4.org\Rawsp4 directory and will place all the extracted Service Pack 4
  binary files there.

5. Using your favorite text editor, open \Sp3.mod\Exchng.inf and
  \Sp4.org\Rawsp4\Exchng.inf.

6. For each line listed in \Sp4.org\Rawsp4\Exchng.inf, make the corresponding
  date, size, and version changes in \Sp3.mod\Exchng.inf. If the file doesn't
  exist in \Sp3.mod\Exchng.inf, skip it. Don't do a complete line copy; this
  will break Setup.

  VERY IMPORTANT! Only change the date, the size (if it changes), and the
  version. Be careful not to delete commas or additional fields.

7. After your modifications are complete, save it to its original location and
  close the text editor.

8. Replace the files in Sp3.mod with the corresponding files in \Sp4.org\Rawsp4.

9. Replace the files in \Sp3.mod\System with the corresponding files in
  \Sp4.org\Rawsp4. This will be most, but not all, of the remaining Service
  Pack 4 files. It may be easiest to do this in File Manager with two windows,
  each sorted by name. To ensure that you are able to see all files, do the
  following:

  a. In File Manager, click Options on the View menu.

  b. Click Show All Files and then click OK.

  c. Select the corresponding Service Pack 4 files and drag them to the
     appropriate directory.

You are now ready to test your client installation.
