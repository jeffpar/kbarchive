The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows Sound System, version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the MIDI-in port on a Creative Labs Sound Blaster Pro sound card
using Microsoft Windows Sound System version 2.0 drivers, the sound card drops
notes during recording sessions.

CAUSE
=====

Windows Sound System 2.0 drivers are not fully compatible with the Sound Blaster
Pro sound card.

RESOLUTION
==========

Re-install the drivers provided by Creative Labs for the Sound Blaster Pro sound
card. To install these drivers, please refer to the Sound Blaster Pro
documentation or contact Creative Labs.

For information about removing the Windows Sound System software, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q90025 How to Uninstall Windows Sound System

STATUS
======

Microsoft is aware of this issue and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Although the Windows Sound System software (with the exception of the Audio
Control utilities) should work with the Sound Blaster Pro sound card, you must
use the drivers supplied by Creative Labs for MIDI support.

When you are using the Windows Sound System drivers with a musical keyboard
attached to the sound card's MIDI-in port, notes may be lost over time when you
are recording. Re-initializing the port may stop the problem temporarily, but
does not resolve the problem.

The third-party products discussed in this article are manufactured by a vendor
independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding
these products' performance or reliability.
