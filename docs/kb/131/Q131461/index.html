-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, on platform(s):
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

During SNA Server Windows NT client setup, you configure which LAN transport the
SNA Server client should use to communicate to the SNA Server. SNA Server 2.0
supports Microsoft Networking (Named pipes) or Novell Netware (IPX/SPX). SNA
Server 2.1 supports those, plus Banyan Vines, and TCP/IP.

SNA Server version 2.0 and 2.1 Windows NT clients default to named pipes even
when the TCP/IP sockets, NetWare IPX/SPX, or Banyan IP interface is the only
option chosen.

CAUSE
=====

In version 2.0 and 2.1, the SNA Server Windows NT client software defaults
internally to use named pipes, even if named pipes is not chosen during SNA
Server client setup.


RESOLUTION
==========

This problem is fixed in SNA Server 2.11. Under 2.11, the SNA Server Windows NT
client will only try the LAN transport(s) configured during SNA Server Windows
NT client setup.

WORKAROUND
==========

Under SNA Server 2.0 and 2.1, the following registry setting can be used to
force the SNA Server Windows NT client to try a specific transport first:

WARNING: Using the Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system- wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of the Registry Editor
can be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SnaBase\Parameters

  TransportBase: REG_DWORD: 1

This will cause the SNA Server client to try the first transport selected in the
SNA client installation, assuming the Microsoft Networking (named pipes) option
is not chosen. If the client-server connection attempt fails, the SNA Server
client will try the next transport configured during SNA client setup. If all of
these fail, named pipes is tried.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in SNA Server for Windows NT,
versions 2.0 and 2.1. This problem has been corrected in SNA Server for Windows
NT version 2.11.
