SUMMARY
=======

This article is the contents of the OPTHELP.TXT file included with Microsoft
Dogs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Dogs OPTHELP.TXT file:

COPYING PICTURES TO THE CLIPBOARD OR MAKING WINDOWS WALLPAPER
=============================================================

You can copy a variety of pictures from Microsoft Dogs to the Windows
Clipboard, or use them as your Windows Wallpaper. If you copy to the
Clipboard, you can paste the picture into another Windows program. If
you make Wallpaper, the picture will appear on your desktop behind the
windows on your screen. To use a Microsoft Dogs picture as wallpaper,
the picture file must be copied to your Windows directory.

To copy a picture:

1. Click the Options button to display the list of choices.

2. Click Picture Gallery.

3. Display the picture you want using the arrow keys or the Gallery
List.

4. Either click Copy Picture to copy the picture to the Clipboard, or
click Make Wallpaper to use the picture as the Windows wallpaper.

You can also change your Windows wallpaper by using the Windows
Control Panel. In Windows 3.1 open the Desktop dialog box and in
Windows 95 or later open the Display dialog box. (For more information
about changing your Windows wallpaper, see your Windows
documentation.)

PRINTING
========

You can print any article screen or popup window in Microsoft Dogs.
Both pictures and words on the screen will be printed, so printing may
take a few minutes. The Quality setting in the Print dialog box
affects the time it takes to print. High quality takes longer to
print; low quality takes less time to print.

To print:

1. Make sure what you want to print is shown on the screen.

2. Click the Options button to display a list of choices.

3. Click Print to display the Print dialog box.

4. Under Quality, click High/Slower (slower printing) or Low/Faster
(faster printing).

5. Under Page Orientation, you can select how you want your picture to
print. Click Portrait/Tall to print a picture that is taller than it
is wide. Click Landscape/Wide to print a picture that is wider than it
is tall.

6. Click OK to begin printing.

USING SCREEN SAVERS
===================

Microsoft Dogs comes with two screen savers: one randomly displays a
collection of images from Microsoft Dogs, the other displays paw
prints walking across the screen.

Microsoft Dogs' screen savers go into effect after the keyboard and
mouse have been idle for a certain amount of time. To change the delay
time or to choose other options that affect the screen saver, use the
Windows Control Panel.

To view Screen Saver options in Windows 3.1:

1. Open the Desktop dialog box. The Screen Saver section contains a
few options.

2. Click the Setup button to see more.

To view Screen Saver options in Windows 95 or later:

1. Open the Display dialog box. The Screen Saver section contains a
few options.

2. Click the Settings button to see more.

(For information about the Control Panel, see your Windows
documentation.)

Testing and Turning On Screen Savers
------------------------------------

When you choose a screen saver, the program copies a picture file to
your hard drive.

To test or turn on a Microsoft Dogs screen saver:

1. Click the Options button to display a list of choices.

2. Click Screen Savers to display the Screen Savers dialog box.

3. Click the screen saver you want.

4. If you want to test the screen saver before you turn it on, click
the Test button. The screen saver will appear on your screen. To
return to the dialog box, click the mouse button or move the mouse.

5. To turn on the screen saver, click OK. If this is the first time
you've selected the screen saver, a dialog box appears telling you
that it will copy a file onto your hard drive.

If you want to switch from one screen saver to another, just select
the new screen saver.

Turning Off and Removing Screen Savers
--------------------------------------

You can turn off a Microsoft Dogs screen saver at any time. You can
also choose to remove the screen saver file from your hard drive to
free up space.

To turn off your screen saver:

1. In the Screen Savers dialog box, click None.

2. Click OK.

To remove a screen saver file from your hard drive:

1. In the Screen Savers dialog box, click the screen saver you want to
remove.

2. Click Remove. A message box will appear asking you if you want to
remove the screen saver file from your hard drive.

3. Click OK.

CONTROLLING SOUNDS
=====================

Microsoft Dogs has two kinds of sounds: background sound effects and
narrations. To control either of these:

1. Click the Options button to display a list of choices.

2. Click Audio/Video to display the Audio/Video dialog box.

3. Do one or both of the following:

   - To control the narrations, choose On or Off under Narrations.

   - To control the background sound effects, choose On or Off under
Sound Effects.

4. Click OK.

Some sounds like guide, video, and glossary audio will always play
when you select them. And each time you start Microsoft Dogs,
narrations and sound effects will both be turned On.

RUNNING FULL SCREEN
=====================

If you are using Windows 95 or later, and your screen resolution is
higher than 640x480, Microsoft Dogs allows you to choose between full-
screen mode (640x480) and your current screen resolution.

To control which way Microsoft Dogs displays on your computer:

1. Click the Options button to display a list of choices.

2. Click Audio/Video to display the Audio/Video dialog box.

3. Choose On or Off under Run Full Screen.

4. Click OK.

Microsoft Dogs will remember this setting and will start in this mode
the next time.

RANDOM JUMPS
==============

You can set up Microsoft Dogs so that the program will display
articles randomly on the screen. This is a great way to find out
what's in Microsoft Dogs.

To start random mode:

1. Click the Options button to display a list of choices.

2. Click Random Jumps.

Random Jumps starts automatically, displaying screen after screen of
Microsoft Dogs. To stop Random Jumps, just click anywhere on the
screen.
