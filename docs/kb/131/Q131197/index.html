-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When, after doing a functional conversion of a FoxPro screen in Visual FoxPro
version 3.0, the objects in that screen cannot be selected by clicking them in
the Visual FoxPro form.

CAUSE
=====

Doing a functional conversion causes Visual FoxPro to add a Page frame to the
form. All of the objects in the form are put into the page frame instead of
directly onto the form.

By clicking the form, you are selecting the page frame object instead of each
individual object.

WORKAROUND
==========

To be able to edit an individual object, click the page frame using the
secondary (right) mouse button. Then select Edit from the control menu. Or you
can select page1 from the object menu in the property box for the form. Then you
can click any item to change or view its properties and methods.

STATUS
======

This Behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When creating a new form in Visual FoxPro version 3.0, you can click the object
to view or change its properties and methods. In FoxPro version 2.x, you can
edit an object by double-clicking it.

When you convert a screen from FoxPro version 2.x to Visual FoxPro version 3.0,
Visual FoxPro adds a page frame to the form. The addition of a page frame was
necessary to emulate the FoxPro version 2.x READ model; the page frame is a
container that holds the converted objects. Clicking an object in the form lists
the properties and methods of the page frame instead of the converted object.

NOTE: Performing a visual conversion instead of the functional conversion
prevents the page frame from being added to the form. The converted objects are
placed directly on the form. However, the properties and methods of the objects
must be manually added to the form.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Open a FoxPro version 2.x screen by choosing Open from the File menu or by
  using the MODIFY FORM command in the Command Window.

2. When the Visual FoxPro Converter dialog box appears, choose Functional
  Conversion, and click Continue.

3. When the form designer window appears, notice that the properties sheet has
  Formset as the default object.

4. Click any object on the form to list the properties and methods for the page
  frame. Double-Click to bring up the PageFrame.AddObject edit window.
