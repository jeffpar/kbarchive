SUMMARY
=======

When Macintosh users mount Windows NT Services for Macintosh (SFM) volumes using
a user account that exists in more than one domain, the user may be connected
with a User ID which does not have the correct permissions for the volume they
are attempting to access.


MORE INFORMATION
================

When Macintosh users attempt to mount a Services for Macintosh (SFM) volume
using AppleShare, they must use either the Apple standard User Authentication
Method (UAM) or the Microsoft UAM. These request a Windows NT user name and
password from the user before allowing the user access to the SFM volume.

When the Windows NT server receives a request from a Macintosh client, the
procedure used to process the request depends upon whether the server is a
domain controller (either primary or backup) or a server that is simply a member
of a domain or workgroup. If the computer is a workgroup server, it compares the
user name and password to the local user accounts database. If the server is a
domain member server or domain controller, it compares the user name and
password to the domain user accounts database. If this does not result in a
match, the server looks in the user accounts database of any trusted domains.
The first match found results in the Macintosh user being assigned the rights
allowed to that user.

This can lead to confusion when a user has matching accounts in more than one
domain, but does not have equivalent permissions on the SFM volume that is being
accessed. Since permissions are granted based on only one of the multiple
accounts, users can be denied access or granted access depending upon which
account was found first.

To avoid this problem, use the Microsoft UAM to connect to the Windows NT Server,
and then enter your &lt;Domain Name&gt;\&lt;User Name&gt; in the user name box
when providing a user name and password. This allows the Windows NT server to
validate you in the correct Domain.
