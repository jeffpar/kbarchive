The following information is from the Microsoft Macro Assembler
Version 5.10 MIXED.DOC file.

Converting Mixed-Language Source Files
   The version of MIXED.INC provided with MASM 5.10 is smaller than the
MASM 5.00 version because most of the functionality has now been built
into MASM and the macros are no longer needed. The following macros
are still supported in MIXED.INC:

   Macro   Purpose

   ifFP    Assembles statement if the memory model uses far data

   FP      Provides ES override if the memory model uses far data

   pLes    Loads data (through ES for far data)

   pLds    Loads data (through DS for far data)

   To use these macros with MASM 5.10, you should include MIXED.INC
after using .MODEL. The macro syntax is shown below:

ifFP  statement
   Assembles the statement if the memory model uses far data. This
macro can be used to push segment registers or take other action that
is only required for far data. For example,

   ifFP     push  ds

pushes the DS register in compact, large, and huge memory models, but
has no effect in small and medium models.

FPoperand
   Gives an ES override if the memory model uses far data. In models
that use near data, FP is null. For example,

   mov      ax,FP[bx]

assembles as

   mov      ax,es:[bx]

in compact, large, and huge memory models, but as

   mov      ax,[bx]

in small and medium models.

pLes  register,address
pLds  register,address
   Loads a pointer from the specified address to the specified
register. If the memory model uses far data, the segment portion of
the address will be moved into ES or DS, depending on the macro used.
For example,

   pLes    bx,arg1

is assembled as

   les     bx,arg1

in compact, large, and huge memory models, but as

   mov     bx,arg1

in small and medium models.
