The following macro will join the current line with the following
line, leaving one space between the last character on the current line
and the first character of the next line.
   Place the following three lines in the [M] and/or [MEP] section(s)
of your TOOLS.INI file, or enter them from the keyboard using the
ASSIGN function (ALT+= in the default keyboard setup):

   ;Macro to join current line with next line.
       join:=endline right arg down begline sdelete
       join:alt+j

   The following is a description of how the join macro works:

   1. Endline moves one place beyond the last character on the current
      line.
   2. Right moves one character further, to insert a space.
   3. arg introduces the argument to the next command (in this case,
      sdelete).
   4. down begline moves to the first character on the next line.

   This process defines a Streamarg for the command sdelete (S stands
for Stream).
   Note that sdelete should be used, not ldelete, because the down
begline sequence would have defined either a Linearg or a Boxarg,
neither of which would join the lines.
   Use sdelete because it closes the stream of characters and/or white
space between the starting cursor position and the ending cursor
position.
