-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After installing Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 4, the SMS
Administrator reports the status of a Send and Distribute job or a Distribute
only job as Complete, even though the distribution server processing has not
been completed.


RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date      Time         Size   File name   Platform
  ----------------------------------------------------
  3/8/99   5:37pm     537,632   Base4.dll   x86   
  3/8/99   5:38pm     918,288   Base4.dll   Alpha

NOTE: Due to file dependencies, the most recent hotfix or feature that contains
the above files may also contain additional files.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This fix applies to Run Command On Workstation jobs with no Run phase. The
scheduler distinguishes between Send phase only jobs and jobs with a Distribute
phase by looking for existence of the Completion and Server detail status
records. If these records do not exist at the time the scheduler updates working
status, then scheduler will assume that the job has only a Send phase and will
base the working status on the status of the Site Arrival detail status record.

If Completion and Server detail status records exist, the scheduler will assume
the job has a Distribute phase and base the working status on the status of the
Completion detail status record only, not on the status of the Server records.

To install the hotfix, perform the following steps:

1. Stop the SMS_EXECUTIVE, SMS_SITE_CONFIG_MANAGER, and SMS_HIERARCHY_MANAGER
  services on the site server.

2. Replace the Base4.dll file in the &lt;sms root
  dir&gt;\Site.srv\&lt;Platform&gt;.bin directory with the version obtained
  from the hotfix.

3. Start the SMS_EXECUTIVE, SMS_SITE_CONFIG_MANAGER, and SMS_HIERARCHY_MANAGER
  services

NOTE: You can perform Step 2 automatically by running Hotfix.exe with the
supplied Hotfix.ini file.
