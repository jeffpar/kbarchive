-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Word 97 for Windows 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you create a mail merge main document in Word and then attach the Microsoft
Outlook Address Book as a data source, the following error message may appear:

  Word was unable to open the data source.

When you close the mail merge main document, the following error message may also
appear:

  Microsoft Word: Word cannot open the document.
  Try one or more of the following
  * On the File menu, click open to open the document
  * Make sure the document has a .Doc extension
  (Outlook Address Book)

CAUSE
=====

Organizations having multiple sites, servers, address book views, and other
containers can experience this problem due to the extent of hierarchy
information retained by the client. This information is cached in the profile
and can prevent Word from finding the Outlook contacts information when the
profile is searched.

This problem can also be caused when the Outlook Address Book does not contain
contacts.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem.

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information on support costs, please go to the following address on the World
Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.





WORKAROUND
==========

If the fix mentioned above is not available, the following methods may allow you
to perform the mail merge with your Outlook Address Book. Use the following
methods appropriate for your situation.

Method 1: Export the Outlook Address Book
-----------------------------------------

To export a list of contacts to use as a data source in a Word mail merge, follow
these steps:

1. In Outlook, create a new folder for the contacts you want to export.

2. If the Folder List is not visible, click the View menu, and then click Folder
  List.

3. On the Tools menu, click Find to group the contacts you want to export.

4. Press and hold down CTRL and drag the contacts to the new contacts folder to
  copy them.

5. On the File menu, click Import and Export to export the new contacts folder.

6. Click "Export to a file".

7. Follow the instructions in the "Import and Export Wizard".

  NOTE: If you export to a file for use in Microsoft Word, choose either the Tab
  Separated Values or the Comma Separated Values file type.

Method 2: Create a Profile
--------------------------

Create the profile manually. Make sure the Outlook Address Book is added first to
the profile.

To configure the profile manually, perform the following steps:

1. Click the Start button, point to Settings, click Control Panel, and then
  double-click Mail. Click the Show Profiles button if it appears in the dialog
  box that is displayed. If a Show Profiles button does not appear, proceed to
  step 2.

2. Click Add.

3. Click Manually Configure Information Services, and then click Next.

4. Type a name for the profile in the Profile Name box, and then click Next.

5. Click Add, click Outlook Address Book in the list of available information
  services, and then click OK.

6. Click Add, click Microsoft Exchange Server in the list of available
  information services, and then click OK.

7. In the Microsoft Exchange Server box, type the name of the Microsoft Exchange
  Server computer to which you want to connect. Type a mailbox name in the
  Mailbox box, and then click Next. Note that you can click Check Name before
  you click OK to verify the server and mailbox names.

After the Outlook Address Book and Microsoft Exchange Server services are added,
additional services may be added to the profile by selecting Add, selecting
other services in the list of available information services, and then clicking
OK.

After the profile is created, start Outlook and ensure the Contacts folder or
folders is included in the Outlook Address Book. To do this, perform the
following steps:

1. On the View menu, click Folder List.

2. In the Folder List, right-click the Contacts folder, and on the
  context-sensitive menu, click Properties.

3. Click the Outlook Address Book tab, and click to select "Show this folder as
  an e-mail Address Book".

  NOTE: Your contacts should appear in the "Name of the address book" box.

4. Click OK.

When a Mail profile is created in the Control Panel Mail tool and "Manually
configure information services" is selected, services can be added in any order.
With the Outlook Address Book included in the profile in front of the Exchange
server, the Contacts address book may be found by Word during the mail merge.

If a new profile is created through the Control Panel Mail tool and the Profile
Generation Wizard is used (default), there is no option of adding an Outlook
Address Book; the first dialog box includes the Exchange Server service and
other services and the Outlook Address Book is automatically added to the
profile. A Microsoft Word Mail Merge with Outlook Address Book using this type
of profile may fail with the error message above.

Method 3: Add a Contact to the Outlook Address Book
---------------------------------------------------

Before you can use the Microsoft Outlook Address Book as a data source in a Word
mail merge, you need to type a contact listing in the Address Book. To do this,
follow these steps:

1. Start Microsoft Outlook.

2. On the Tools menu, click Services. On the Services tab, make sure Outlook
  Address Book is in the profile list. If Outlook Address Book is not in the
  list, click Add and add Outlook Address Book.

Knowledge Base:

3. On the Outlook bar, which is on the left, click Contacts. If the Outlook bar
  is not visible, click Outlook Bar on the View menu.

4. On the File menu, click New, and click Contact on the New menu.

5. Type the information for the new contact entry.

6. On the Contact toolbar, click Save, and then click Close.

7. On the Outlook bar, right-click the Contacts button. Click Properties on the
  shortcut menu, and then click the Outlook Address Book tab.

8. Click to select the "Show this folder as an e-mail Address Book" check box,
  and click OK.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The original Wwpab.cnv file was limited in the amount of information it read
from the profile. When it reached the limit without finding the Contacts address
book, it reported that the data source could not be found. This is corrected in
the newer Wwpab.cnv file.

Additional query words: contacts addressbook
