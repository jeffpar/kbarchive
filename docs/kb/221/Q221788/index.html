SUMMARY
=======

When you need to distribute a localized version of an application developed
using Visual Basic, you need to know which localized files need to be added to
your localized distribution package, and where are they located.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If a Microsoft component has localized resources, these are stored in a separate
resource DLL for each language. You can find a list of resource DLLs (often
called satellite DLLs) in the component's dependency (.dep) file. To view the
contents of a .dep file, open it with a text editor such as Notepad as a normal
text file.

Once you know which satellite DLLs you need, you can download them from the Web.
The easiest way to do this is as follows:

1. Open the dependency file for an ActiveX control. This example uses
  comctl32.dep.

2. Determine the location of your language's information. This example uses
  German.

3. In the Localized Dependencies section you will find:

   - The name of the satellite DLL: CmCtlDE.dll

   - The cab file where it is stored: CmCtlDE.cab

   - The URL of the cab file: http://activex.microsoft.com/controls/vb6

4. Point your Web browser to the URL you create by concatenating the URL and cab
  file above, with a forward slash ( / ) between them:

  http://activex.microsoft.com/controls/vb6/CmCtlDE.cab

  This allows you to download the cab file to your machine.

5. Once you have downloaded the cab file, you can extract the file you need and
  add it to your distribution package.
