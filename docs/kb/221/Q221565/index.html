Version(s): winnt:5.5

Keyword(s): exc55 EXC55SP3Fix
Last Modified: 30-SEP-1999

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Mail sent from the host to Exchange Server by means of the Sendfile command
might result in the OV/VM (PROFS) Connector restarting continuously. This will
result in a mail backlog on the host side.

CAUSE
=====

There are certain key words in the host (VM) environment that should not be
used, for example, the keyword SYSTEM. When you use the keyword SYSTEM as part
of a target Exchange Server mail recipient, the host will strip out the username
(SYSTEM) before sending it to the OV/VM (PROFS) connector, which causes the
OV/VM (PROFS) Connector to go into an endless loop.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: OV/VM (PROFS) Connector

+-------------------------+
| File name  | Version    | 
+-------------------------+
| Lsvmhc.dll | 5.5.2573.0 | 
+-------------------------+


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To send a note from the host to Exchange Server, the format is as follows:

  SENDFILE &lt;FILENAME&gt; &lt;FILETYPE&gt; &lt;FILEMODE&gt; &lt;USERID&gt; AT
  &lt;NODEID&gt;

So in this case, taking the file Profile.exec on the A disk, and sending it to
the Exchange(system) address, the command line would be:

  SENDFILE PROFILE EXEC A SYSTEM AT EXCHANGE
