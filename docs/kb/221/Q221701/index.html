-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The MouseUp event of a container does not fire when you click on a disabled
object within the container. However, the MouseUp event does fire when you click
elsewhere in the container object.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information
about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Q194022 INFO: Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs, What, Where, Why

Q194295 HOWTO: Tell That Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs Are Installed

MORE INFORMATION
================

This behavior seems to occur when the container's Move and MouseMove events have
had code in them and, therefore, appear in the Properties sheet as having a user
procedure attached to them.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a form.

2. Place a container control on the form and set the following properties and
  events:

MouseDown event=

  WAIT WINDOW "MouseDown Event" NOWAIT

MouseUp event=

  WAIT WINDOW "MouseUp Event" NOWAIT

BackColor=0,0,160

3. Open the container's Move event, add some code, and then delete it. When you
  return to the Properties sheet, the Move event should have [User Procedure]
  next to it instead of [Default]. However, it will be empty.

4. Repeat step 3 on the MouseMove event of the container.

5. Right-click the container and choose Edit from the short-cut menu. Place a
  shape or command button object inside the container and set the following
  properties:

* If using a shape, change the BackColor Property
BackColor=0,128,0
Enabled=.F.

6. Run the form.

7. Click on the container (the blue area) and note that both the MouseDown and
  MouseUp events fire.

8. Click on the shape (the green area) and note that only the MouseDown event
  fires.
