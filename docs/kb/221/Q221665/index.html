-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In Visual FoxPro 6.0, if the header file containing invalid command syntax is
included in a form in the Form Designer or in a class using the Class Designer,
the following error message appears:

  Fatal Error : Exception code = C0000005

In Visual FoxPro 5.0a running under Windows NT 4.0, the following error appears:

  An application error has occurred and an application error log is being
  created.
  VFP.exe
  Exception:access violation (Oxc0000005), Address: 0x006b0f7f

In Visual FoxPro 5.0a running on Windows 98, the following error may appear:

  This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down.
  VFP caused an invalid page fault in module VFP.EXE at 015f:006b455b

Using the #INCLUDE command to include the header file generates a compile error
or, if it is in a PRG, an error log file is created.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3. For more information
about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following articles in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Q194022 INFO: Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs, What, Where, Why

Q194295 HOWTO: Tell That Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs Are Installed

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create an include file, named test.h.

2. In test.h, put in the following code:

  #ifndef junk_include
     junk_include .t.
  endif   &amp;&amp; Purposely leave out the # sign
   

3. Create a form, named test.scx.

4. In the Form Designer, select the Form menu pad and the Include File menu
  option.

5. In the Include File dialog, include test.h.

6. Save the form.

  Noted that immediately after saving the form, one of the errors mentioned in
  the Symptoms section occurs and Visual FoxPro terminates.
