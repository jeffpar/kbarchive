-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, versions 3.0, 3.0b, 5.0, 5.0a, 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You compile a Visual FoxPro program file, form, class library, or report that
contains at least one compile error. SET LOGERRORS is ON, which is the default,
and this forces Visual FoxPro to write any compile errors to a .ERR file. When
the .ERR file is opened within the Visual FoxPro editor, it will appear as
expected with line feeds between each line, but if the file is opened with
another editor, such as Notepad, no line feeds appear, and the text will all
appear on a single line.

CAUSE
=====

The .ERR file is written with a carriage return character (ASCII value 13) at
the end of each line, but no line feed character (ASCII 10). The Visual FoxPro
editor moves to a new line with each ASCII 13 character, but other editors such
as Notepad may not.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3.

For more information about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following
articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q194022 INFO: Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs, What, Where, Why

  Q194295 HOWTO: Tell That Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs Are Installed

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Run the following code from a program (.PRG) file:

  =STRTOFILE('This line will cause an error!'+ CHR(13) + CHR(10) + ;
  'So will this one!', 'testxx.prg')
  SET LOGERRORS ON    &amp;&amp; This is the default
  COMPILE testxx.prg
  RUN /N notepad testxx.err

MOTE: If you are running Visual FoxPro 3.0 or 5.0, then you must create the
program file manually. The STRTOFILE function is not available in earlier
versions of Visual FoxPro.

2. Look at the error file that is opened in Notepad.

3. All the text will appear on the same line, but it will wrap if Word Wrap is
  enabled in Notepad. The file will contain the text below. The character
  represented here as [] will appear as a black square in Notepad.

  This line will cause an error![]Error in line 1: Unrecognized command
  verb.[]So will this one![]Error in line 3: Unrecognized command verb.[]
