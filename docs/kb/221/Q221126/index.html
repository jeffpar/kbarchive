SUMMARY
=======

The purpose of this article is to help clarify the resulting permissions of
using Instance and Class security.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Chapter 4 of the Microsoft Systems Management Server 2.0 Administrators Guide
discusses Instance and Class security available for objects in the SMS Site
Database. It may be unclear as to which type of security takes precedence in a
particular situation.

Instance security does not take precedence over Class security and vice versa.
Unlike Windows NT File permissions, the resulting rights granted are a union of
the Class and Instance rights.

EXAMPLE 1:

UserX has all Class level Package rights for All Packages.
UserX has no Instance level Package rights for PackageA.

Result:

UserX will have full rights for PackageA as well as all other packages because
full Class level rights were granted to the user for All Packages.

EXAMPLE 2:

UserX has no Class level Package rights for All Packages.
UserX has all Instance level Package rights for PackageA.

Result:

UserX will have full rights for PackageA, but no other Packages (unless
explicitly granted), because no explicit rights were granted at the Class
level.
