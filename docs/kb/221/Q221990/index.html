SYMPTOMS
========

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry.
Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you
understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information
about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following
article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

Visual Basic 6.0 and Visual Basic 5.0 are both installed on the same system.
After uninstalling Visual Basic 6.0, the following error appears when you
attempt to add the Windows Common Controls or the Common Dialog control to a
Visual Basic 5.0 project:

  Error
  Could Not Be Loaded


CAUSE
=====

The registry contains a reference to a control version that was removed by
uninstalling Visual Basic 6.0.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

Delete the registry key for the problem control from:

  HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib

and re-register it. For additional information about deleting and re-registering
an ActiveX control, please refer to the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q217180 HOWTO: Delete and Re-Register TypeLib GUID for ActiveX Control


MORE INFORMATION
================

The following are the Class ID numbers for the controls known to be affected by
this problem:


ActiveX Control          File Name      Class ID
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Windows Common Controls  comctl32.ocx  6B7E6392-850A-101B-AFC0-4210102A8DA7
Common Dialog Control    comdlg32.ocx  F9043C88-F6F2-101A-A3C9-08002B2F49FB

When you locate the Class ID folder for these controls in the registry, the
folder will contain a version folder. This version folder contains the version
entries for these controls.

Installing multiple versions of the same ActiveX control results in multiple
entries in the version folder. Deleting the ActiveX folder from the registry and
then registering the control will add the correct entries to the registry.
