SYMPTOMS
========

When an ActiveX control is marked as Safe for Scripting and Safe for
Initialization when packaging it using the Package and Deployment Wizard (PDW),
depending on your security settings for unsafe controls, Internet Explorer may
still identify the ActiveX control as unsafe, or it may display an "Object
Required" error.

CAUSE
=====

The ActiveX control is not marked as Safe for Scripting and Safe for
Initialization in spite of choosing these options when packaging the control
using the Visual Basic 6.0 Package and Deployment Wizard.

This is because the [AddToRegistry] section is missing from the INF file
generated by the Visual Basic 6.0 PDW, and this section usually contains the
registry entries that mark the controls as safe.


RESOLUTION
==========

You can manually add the [AddToRegistry] section in your INF file by following
the steps listed below.

1. Create your ActiveX Control.

2. Package your control using the Package and Deployment Wizard.

3. Before you deploy the package, go to the folder for that package in Windows
  Explorer

4. There should be a support directory under that package. Open the Xxx.inf file
  under this Support directory with Notepad.

5. Paste the following code at the end of the file.

  [AddToRegistry]
  HKLM,"SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{04CD5348-D028-11D2-82A6-00C04FB9D847}\Implemented Categories\{7DD95802-9882-11CF-9FA9-00AA006C42C4}"
  HKLM,"SOFTWARE\Classes\CLSID\{04CD5348-D028-11D2-82A6-00C04FB9D847}\Implemented Categories\{7DD95801-9882-11CF-9FA9-00AA006C42C4}"

6. Save the file with the same name.

7. Run the .bat file in the Support folder, which is created by the PDW. This
  bat file will re-create your .cab file with the new changes.

8. Now you can use the PDW to deploy the package to the appropriate Web server
  location.

The preferred method for marking a control as safe is to implement the
IObjectSafety interface. For information on implementing theIObjectSafety
Interface, please see the following:

  Q182598 HOWTO: Implement IObjectSafety in Visual Basic Controls

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/vbasic/downloads/download.asp?ID=030

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3.

For more information about Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs, please see the
following articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q194022 INFO: Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs, What, Where, Why

  Q194295 HOWTO: Tell That Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs Are Installed

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Create a simple ActiveX Control with at least one method or property.

2. Package it using PDW with the Internet Package option.

3. Set it as Safe for Scripting and Safe for Initialization in the PDW.

4. Deploy the Package to Web Server using the PDW.

5. From the Tools menu, click Internet Options. Click the Security tab. Change
  the following settings:

   - Enable - download unsigned ActiveX Controls

   - Enable - initialize and script ActiveX control mark for safe

   - Prompt - initialize and script ActiveX control not mark for safe

6. Insert your control in your HTML page with an Object tag and set the codebase
  point to your .cab file. Script your control by setting/getting the property
  or calling its methods in the window onload event

7. From your client browser, navigate to your HTML page.

8. You will be prompted with the message that the control is not safe for
  scripting and initialization even though your security settings are set to
  enable for scriting and initialization safe controls. This shows that your
  control has not been marked safe as expected.
