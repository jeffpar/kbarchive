SYMPTOMS
========

When you play Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 or Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000,

This behavior can occur if both of the following conditions are true:

in the game. To do this:

1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

2. If you are using Flight Simulator 2000, type the following line in the Named
  box:

  fs2000.cfg

  If you are using Flight Simulator 98, type the following line in the Named
  box:

  fltsim98.cfg

3. In the "Look in" box, click My Computer, and then click Find Now.

4. In the list of found files, double-click the Fltsim98.cfg or Fs2000.cfg file.

5. In the "Choose the program you want to use" box, click Notepad.

6. Click to clear the "Always use this program to open this file" check box, and
  then click OK.

7. Scroll to the end of the file, press ENTER twice, and then type the following
  lines, pressing ENTER after you type each line:
