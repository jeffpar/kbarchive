The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

After you uninstall a third-party application that may have relied on shared
.dlls and registry keys from an Exchange Server computer, all Exchange
Server-related Event IDs in the Event Viewer's application log are missing their
descriptions. All Exchange Server-related descriptions show up as:

  The description for Event ID (&lt;Event ID&gt;) in Source (&lt;Component
  Name&gt;) could not be found.

You may be missing the following files from Exchsrvr\Res folder:

- Eventmsg.dll: Used for the Windows NT Event Viewer Service.

- Ccmsg.dll: Used to display Exchange Server chat events.

- Dsmsg.dll: Used to display Exchange Server directory events.

- Imap4evt.dll: Used to display Exchange Server IMAP4 events.

- Imcsmg.dll: Used to display Exchange Server Internet Mail Connector or
  Internet Mail Service events.

- Mdbmsg.dll: Used to display Exchange Server information store events.

- Mtamsg.dll: Used to display Exchange Server message transfer agent (MTA)
  events.

- Nntpevt.dll: Used to display Exchange Server Network News Transport Protocol
  (NNTP) events.

- Pop3evt.dll: Used to display Exchange Server Post Office Protocol (POP3)
  events.

You may also possibly be missing any or all Exchange Server-related keys under
the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\EventLog\Application\

CAUSE
=====

After you uninstall an application that may have depended on or used any of
these files or registry keys, the files or keys may be removed along with the
application.

WORKAROUND
==========

- Reinstall Exchange Server.

-or-

- Manually replace missing files and recreate the registry keys:

  1. Copy all files from Server\Setup\I386\Res folder on the Exchange Server
     5.5 CD into the Exchsrvr\Res folder on your Exchange Server computer,
     choosing to overwrite the existing files.

  2. Make a backup of your registry.

  3. Export the following registry keys from a working Exchange Server 5.5
     computer:

(NOTE: There may be additional keys missing depending on the server's
configuration. Adding these keys should bring back most Exchange Server-related
Event ID descriptions but may not bring back all.)

      - MSExchange NNTP Interface
      - MSExchange POP3 Interface
      - MSExchangeAdmin
      - MSExchangeCCMC
      - MSExchangeDS
      - MSExchangeDSExp
      - MSExchangeDSImp
      - MSExchangeDX
      - MSExchangeFB
      - MSExchangeIMC
      - MSExchangeIS
      - MSExchangeIS Private
      - MSExchangeIS Public
      - MSExchangeMig
      - MSExchangeMigDS
      - MSExchangeMTA
      - MSExchangeNTExt
      - MSExchangeNWExt
      - MSExchangeSA
      - MXExchangeSetup
      - MSExchangeWEB
      - MSProxy
      - NTBackup
      - MSExchangeATMTA
      - MSExchangeMSMI
      - PCMTA
      - ESE97
      - MSExchange IMAP4 Interface
      - MSExchangeES

- Copy the resulting exported registry keys (*.reg files) from the working
  Exchange Server computer into the problem Exchange Server computer's
  registry.

- After the importation is finished, double-click on each registry key file to
  re-register the key into the registry.

Exchange Server-related Event ID descriptions should now be viewable, including
events already written to the event log.
