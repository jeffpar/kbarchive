-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a user tries to download the offline Address Book, that user may receive
the following error messages:

  An error occurred while opening the Microsoft Exchange Offline Address Book
  file on the Microsoft Exchange server. See your administrator.

  Unable to download the Offline Address Book. The Offline Address Book could
  not be accessed.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the user cannot gain access to the directory because
access to the directory has been limited with search permissions (on the
Permissions tab on either the Organization, Site, or Configuration container).

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, either remove the search permissions from the
container or grant permissions for the container to the Microsoft Windows NT
account of the user.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you set search permissions, you may inadvertently limit access to information
in the Exchange Server directory. Before you apply any search permissions, make
sure that you understand the ramifications of this action.

If incorrect search permissions are set and the client downloads the offline
Address Book, there may not be any Address Books displayed to choose from under
the Address Book section.
