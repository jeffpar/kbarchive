SYMPTOMS
========

You may encounter browsing problems in a TCP/IP environment with a multihomed
primary domain controller (PDC). One of the problems you may encounter is
incomplete browse lists.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Domain Master Browser service properly binds to only one network interface.
The role of domain master browser is served by the PDC. It is preferred and
suggested that your PDC not be multihomed.

If your PDC is multihomed because it is serving as a router and you are not
afforded the option to promote a singlehomed backup domain controller (BDC) to
PDC, you can try the following technique to work around this problem.

Unbind the WINS Client (TCP/IP) interface from all of your adapters except for
one. This will also unbind the NetBIOS, Workstation, and Server interfaces from
this card. It is recommended that these bindings remain on the adapter on the
busiest segment. Although the WINS Client (TCP/IP) interface is unbound from the
other adapters, there will still be connectivity to the PDC from the other
segments. The TCP/IP Protocol interface is left bound, which will be able to
route the requests to the bound interface. After unbinding the additional
adapters, you should make sure that WINS and any LMHosts files do not refer to
the unbound adapters.

Follow these steps to unbind the WINS Client (TCP/IP) interface:

1. In Control Panel, double-click Network.

2. Click the Bindings tab.

3. In the Show Bindings For drop down box, select All Adapters.

4. Expand all of the adapters.

5. Select WINS Client (TCP/IP) and click Disable.
