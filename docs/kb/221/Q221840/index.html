-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Users of Schedule+ 1.0 are unable to send meeting requests to a Lotus Notes user
over the Exchange Notes Connector. The following error message may be found in
the Exchange Notes Connector Administrator's log viewer:

  1999/02/03 17:26:49- LME-NOTES-MEXNTS(01cf) 1 08217:Message is looping,
  returning non-delivery report to sender. Message ID: c=US;a=

The message is moved to the Bad Mail folder and stays there.

CAUSE
=====

The Schedule+ 1.0 meeting requests do not have a Global Unique ID (GUID)
associated with them and, therefore, the Exchange Notes Connector does not know
how to handle them.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Exchange Notes Connector

+--------------------------+
| File name   | Version    | 
+--------------------------+
| Lsmexhc.dll | 5.5.2572.0 | 
+--------------------------+


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server 5.5 Service
Pack 3.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The exchange of meeting requests from Schedule+ 1.0 to Lotus Notes through the
Exchange Notes Connector is not a supported feature of the product. However,
these Schedule+ 1.0 meeting requests are converted to a text note and passed on
to the designated Notes recipient, but the meeting information does not remain
intact.
