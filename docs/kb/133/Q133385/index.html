The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Because the Systems Management Server Executive is a wrapper containing the
actual Systems Management Server services for many functions in the Site, they
are run as threads and are, therefore, not subject to many of the convenient
Performance Monitor (PERFMON.EXE) features available to process- level
statistics.

This article describes how to monitor each thread for certain counters and how to
isolate performance issues within the Executive.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To use Performance Monitor and the Windows NT Registry Editor to monitor and
isolate Systems Management Server Executive performance issues to certain
threads:

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

1. Run Performance Monitor, and for the Object Thread, select %Processor Time,
  ID Thread, and all SMS_EXEC instances.

2. Monitor each thread's %Processor Time and identify the instance number in
  Performance Monitor for the thread that takes the most processor time.

3. Find the ID Thread item that has the same instance number as the thread you
  identified in step 2 and select this ID Thread with the mouse. Note that its
  Last and Average status indicators have the same value. This value is the
  decimal thread ID.

4. Convert the decimal thread ID to a hexadecimal (hex) number to get the
  Windows NT thread ID for that SMS Component thread of the Executive.

5. Start Registry Editor (REGEDT32.EXE).

  a. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:

        \SOFTWARE\Microsoft\SMS\Components\SMS_EXECUTIVE\Threads

  b. Compare the thread ID of each component to the hex number from step 4.

     If they match, you have found the SMS Executive thread component
     responsible for the %Processor Time usage identified in Perfmon.

More Troubleshooting Tips
-------------------------

To watch each task the identified thread component performs and the associated
%Processer Time usage, use the SMSTrace tool and monitor the component log file
beside the Performance Monitor window. When the log file goes idle, expect the
%Processer Time usage of the component's thread to go idle also.

To learn about other statistics of the thread, look at additional counters, for
example, %User Time, etc.
