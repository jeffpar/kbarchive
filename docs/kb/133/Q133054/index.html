The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SourceSafe for Windows, versions 3.04, 3.1 
- Microsoft SourceSafe for Windows NT, versions 3.04, 3.1

SUMMARY
=======

The SourceSafe Data directory includes a database that contains all of your
files and projects. Although every precaution has been taken to ensure the
integrity of all SourceSafe files, there are certain events that can cause the
data in this database to become corrupted. Errors relating to the Data
directory, to filenames such as aacpaaaa, or to missing files such as abaaaaaa.b
occur.

SourceSafe database corruption can be caused by a variety of factors. Listed
below are a few events that can cause database corruption:

- Power loss

- System hangs (stops responding)

- User terminates a long process

- Bad network connections

- Running out of disk space

- Network problems

- Operating system problems

MORE INFORMATION
================


Use the following steps to analyze and resolve the database problems SourceSafe
is having:

1. The Analyze program allows you to search for database corruption or database
  errors. Use the following command to execute the Analyze program:

        Analyze &lt;SourceSafe Data directory&gt;

  To run the Analyze program in unattended mode, use the -i- option. For
  example, if you want to run Analyze overnight and output the results to a
  text file, use the following syntax:

         Analyze -i- &lt;path to data&gt; &gt; c:\output.txt

  Analyze.exe goes through your database, reporting possible problems. If
  database errors or corrupted database files are discovered, continue through
  the following steps.

  The primary use of this program is to scan a SourceSafe database for integrity
  and/or errors. We recommend that administrators run it every one to three
  months to verify that there are no problems in their SourceSafe database.

2. If there are access rights problems, "unable to checkout files" errors,
  "losing checkout status" errors, or any other errors that refer to the
  Status.dat or Rights.dat file, run the Ddconv.exe or Ddconvw.exe program.
  These programs update a SourceSafe database from an older format to the
  current format. By default, these programs are installed in the \admin
  subdirectory.

  These programs are used primarily by installation scripts to verify that the
  format of an installed SourceSafe database is correct after an update has
  occurred. Ddconv.exe is also used to create a new SourceSafe database (see
  the Mkss utility for more information). During installation, if SourceSafe
  cannot find all of the installed databases, the administrator may have to run
  this utility manually. Ddconv.exe (with the -s option) can also be used by
  the administrator to rebuild files in the database.


3. If the errors returned by the Analyze program refer to "FREE CHAIN" and you
  are using Microsoft SourceSafe versions 3.x, run the Fixfree program.
  Fixfree.exe fixes a variety of database errors reported when running
  Analyze.exe, such as the following:
   - Invalid extended header structure.

   - Error in extended header.

   - Error processing checkout free chain.

   - Checkout free chain contains a loop.

   - Checkout chain contains a loop.

4. If the errors returned by the Analyze program refer to "PROJECT FILE" and you
  are using Microsoft SourceSafe versions 3.x, run the Fixprj program. You can
  use Fixprj.exe to fix a variety of project errors, such as the following:
   - File Not Found: &lt;filename.a or b&gt;.

   - Error reading PRJ INT entry: &lt;num&gt; of 38 bytes read.

   - Error in project file.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q123427 SourceSafe: Use FIXPRJ.EXE to Fix Project Errors

5. If the errors returned by the Analyze program refer to "PARENT CHAIN", and
  you are using Microsoft SourceSafe versions 3.x, run the Fixpar program.
  Fixpar.exe repairs various database errors reported by Analyze.exe such as
  the following:
   - Error in Parent Chain.

   - Parent not found.

  Fixpar.exe removes references to projects that no longer exist.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q130178 FIXPAR Fixes Database Errors Reported by ANALYZE.EXE

6. If the error returned by Analyze.exe refers to "Cannot find file
  &lt;filename&gt;.b" or "Cannot find file &lt;filename&gt;.a," the best
  workaround is to save a copy of the correct current file. Recover both files
  (&lt;filename&gt; and &lt;filename&gt;.a or &lt;filename&gt;.b) as they
  existed on the backup. Then update the file in SourceSafe to the current
  version.

  If the &lt;filename&gt;.a or &lt;filename&gt;.b refers to a project, use
  Fixprj.exe to rebuild the project file.

7. If the errors returned by Analyze.exe refer to any other type of problem,
  call Microsoft Technical Support for further assistance. You can reach
  Microsoft Technical Support at the following phone numbers:
   - In the United States, call (425) 635-7014.

   - In Canada, call (905) 568-3503.
