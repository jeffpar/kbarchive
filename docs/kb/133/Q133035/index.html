The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install the drivers for the Diamond Sonic Sound LX sound card, the
following problems occur:

- When you restart the computer you receive an error message stating that the
  Mmsystem.dll file was changed.

- No sound events occur and the Play button is unavailable in the Sounds tool
  in Control Panel.

- You do not see a speaker icon on the taskbar.

It may seem as if the drivers for the Diamond Sonic Sound LX sound card are not
functioning.

CAUSE
=====

The Setup program for the Diamond Sonic Sound LX sound card (and other Diamond
sound cards) makes the following changes to the [drivers] section of the
System.ini file:

- WAVE=SND16.DRV

- MIDI=SND16.DRV

The Setup program also replaces the Mmsystem.dll file.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to edit the System.ini file. Change the
line that reads

  WAVE=SND16.DRV

to read:

  WAVE=MMSYSTEM.DLL.

Change the line that read

  MIDI=SND16.DRV

to read:

  MIDI=MMSYSTEM.DLL

After you make these changes, save and then close the file.

Also, extract the original Mmsystem.dll file to the Windows\System folder. To do
so, follow these steps:

1. Restart your computer. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, press
  the F8 key, then choose Safe Mode Command Prompt Only from the Startup menu.

  NOTE: If you are using a Windows 95 CD-ROM, choose Step-by-Step Confirmation
  and choose Yes only for the CD-ROM drivers.

2. If you are using Windows 95 disks, type the following line at the MS-DOS
  prompt

  extract &lt;drive&gt;:\win95_08.cab mmsystem.dll /l c:\windows\system

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter of the floppy disk drive you are
  using. Make sure to insert Disk 8 in the floppy disk drive.

3. If you are using a Windows 95 CD-ROM, type the following line at the MS-DOS
  prompt

  extract &lt;drive&gt;:\win95\win95_08.cab mmsystem.dll /l c:\windows\system

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive.

4. After you extract the Mmsystem.dll file, restart your computer normally.
