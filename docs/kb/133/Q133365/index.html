  click OK.

3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the
  following check boxes:

   - Process Config.sys File
   - Process Autoexec.bat File
   - Process Winstart.bat File (if available)

  Q177604 Multimedia: Troubleshooting Using Clean Boot of Windows 95

Remove and Reinstall Audio Compression Drivers
----------------------------------------------

To remove and reinstall Windows 95/98 Audio Compression drivers:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

3. On the Windows Setup tab, click Multimedia, and then click Details.

4. Click the Audio Compression check box to clear it, and then click OK.

5. Click Apply.

6. On the Windows Setup tab, click Multimedia, and then click Details.

7. Click the Audio Compression check box to select it, and then click OK.

  compression drivers.

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Remove and Reinstall 16-bit MSACM Drivers and Codecs
----------------------------------------------------

Microsoft recommends that you use 32-bit MSACM unless your program requires a
16-bit MSACM codec. 16-bit MSACM is installed by programs that use 16-bit
MSACM.

If the issue only occurs when you use a program that uses 16-bit MSACM, remove
and reinstall the 16-bit MSACM drivers and codecs. To do this:

1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files or Folders.

2. In the Named box, type "msacm.ini msadpcm.acm imaadpcm.acm msgsm610.acm"
  (without the quotation marks), and then click Find Now.

3. On the Edit menu, click Select All.

4. Press DELETE, and then click Yes.

5. Remove and reinstall the program that uses 16-bit MSACM.

Confirm 32-bit MSACM Installation
---------------------------------

Microsoft recommends that you use 32-bit MSACM unless your program requires a
16-bit MSACM codec. 32-bit MSACM is a component of Windows 95/98.

To verify that the 32-bit MSACM driver files in your Windows\System folder are
properly installed:

1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files or Folders.

2. In the Named box, type "msacm*.*" (without the quotation marks), and then
  click Find Now.

3. In the list of found files, verify that the Msacm.drv, Msacm.dll, and
  Msacm32.dll files are located in the System folder. Delete or rename any
  copies of these files that are not in the System folder or the Sysbckup
  folder.

4. In the list of found files, verify that the file versions of the Msacm.drv,
  Msacm.dll, and Msacm32.dll files match, and that the file versions are 4.0 or
  greater.

  To check the file version of each of these files:

  a. In the list of found files, right-click the file you want to check.

  b. On the Version tab, note the file version.

  c. Click OK.

5. If any of the files are missing from the System folder, if the file versions
  do not match, or if the file version of any of the files is less than 4.0,
  proceed to the appropriate method for your version of Windows to remove and
  reinstall the 32-bit MSACM drivers.

Remove and Reinstall 32-bit MSACM Drivers in Windows 98
-------------------------------------------------------

To remove and reinstall the 32-bit MSACM drivers in Windows 98:

5. On the View tab, under the Hidden Files branch in the Advanced Settings box,
  click Show All Files, and then click OK.

6. Extract the Msacm.dll and Msacm32.dll files from the Win98_33.cab file, and
  then extract the Msacm.drv file from the Win98_40.cab file. To extract a file
  from a .cab file, follow these steps:

  a. Double-click the .cab file that contains the file you want to extract.

  b. Right-click the file you want to extract, and then click Extract.

  c. Double-click the icon for the hard disk on which Windows is installed,
     double-click the Windows folder, and then click the Sysbckup folder.

  d. Click OK.

7. Restart the computer in MS-DOS mode.

8. At the command prompt, type the following lines, pressing ENTER after you
  type each line:

  cd \windows\system
  del msacm*.*
  cd ..\sysbckup
  copy msacm*.* ..\system

9. At the command prompt, type "exit" (without the quotation marks), and then
  press ENTER.
