SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to delete files in Windows 95/98.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To delete files in Windows 95/98, do the following:

1. In Windows Explorer, locate the file you want to delete.

2. With your right mouse button, click the file. Click Delete.

3. A message may appear asking if you want to move the file to the Recycle Bin.
  Click Yes.

4. With your right mouse button, click the Recycle Bin. Click Empty Recycle Bin.

5. A message asks if you are sure you want to delete the items in the Recycle
  Bin. If you click Yes, the items are permanently removed from your hard
  drive.

  NOTE: If you are working from a networked drive, the file is deleted
  immediately when you click Delete.

  NOTE: Windows sets a maximum percentage of your hard disk to be used for the
  Recycle Bin. This value can be adjusted (see steps below), but once this
  value is exceeded (or hard disk space becomes necessary for other
  operations), files are automatically removed from the Recycle Bin and
  consequently, the hard drive.

You have several options for customizing the Windows Recycle Bin.

If you do not wish to see the confirmation dialog before Windows moves the
selected file(s) to the Recycle Bin, do the following:

1. With your right mouse button, click the Recycle Bin. Click Properties.

2. Make sure the Display Delete Confirmation check box is clear.

3. Click OK.

To adjust the maximum percentage of hard disk space used for the Recycle Bin, do
the following:

1. With your right mouse button, click the Recycle Bin. Click Properties.

2. Adjust the slider to the desired percentage value.

3. Click OK.

If you would like Windows 95/98 to delete files immediately, rather than moving
them to the Recycle Bin, do the following:

1. With your right mouse button, click the Recycle Bin. Click Properties.

2. Make sure a check appears in the box next to "Do Not Move Files To The
  Recycle Bin. Remove Files Immediately On Delete.

3. Click OK.

NOTE: Hard drives can be configured independently. These steps may need to be
modified for some hard drives.
