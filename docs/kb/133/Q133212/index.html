SUMMARY
=======

This article describes the features of the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks
in Windows 95.

For Windows 95, Microsoft has written a 32-bit NetWare-compatible network
provider and file system driver. These components are installed in the Windows
95 network architecture for seamless integration into the Windows 95 user
interface.

If real-mode NetWare TSRs or add-on products are not needed, then there is no
need for NetWare real-mode components such as Ipx.com, Ipxodi.com, Netx.exe, or
Vlm.exe. The Windows 95 NetWare Core Protocol (NCP) client and server supply
32-bit performance that is faster than native NetWare drivers are and take up no
conventional memory.

The Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks provides interoperability for NetWare
2.2, 3.x, and 4.x servers running bindery emulation. Windows 95 systems can
browse NetWare servers, connect to servers, map network drives, and connect
NetWare bindery-based utilities. The Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks
executes NetWare login scripts that do not contain TSRs.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks has the following key features:

- High performance - The Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks performs large
  block file transfers and common network read and write operations much faster
  than Windows 3.1 with the Novell VLM shell.

- Reliability - The client runs in protected mode and is designed for operation
  in a multitasking environment.

  No conventional memory footprint - By running in protected mode as a 32-bit
  VxD, the drivers take no MS-DOS conventional memory space.

- Auto-reconnect - This feature allows the Microsoft Client for NetWare
  Networks to behave similarly to Microsoft network Server Message Block (SMB)
  connections. If a Windows 95-based computer loses its connection to an NCP
  server, the Windows 95-based computer's connection is re- established when
  that NCP server becomes available again. The connection status, drive
  mappings, and printer connections are all re-established.

- Packet Burst protocol support - The Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks
  supports burst mode NCPs for faster transfer of NCP information.

- Client-side caching - As a Windows 95 file system driver (FSD), the Windows
  95 NCP redirector uses the same 32-bit cache as all other FSDs and can cache
  network data for faster access.

- Plug and Play-aware - The Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks is Plug and
  Play enabled and monitors and responds to Plug and Play events.

- Long filename support - The Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks supports
  long filenames on NetWare volumes configured with OS/2 Name Space (an HPFS
  implementation for Novell NetWare server volumes) and on Windows 95-based
  computers configured with the File and Print Sharing for NetWare Networks
  service (NCP server).

- Fully integrated into the Windows 95 user interface - NetWare server
  resources can be accessed using Network Neighborhood, or through any drive or
  printer dialog box.

- Fully interoperable with Novell NetWare 2.2, 3.x, and 4.x servers - The
  Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks can access bindery-based NetWare
  servers. This includes 2.2 and 3.x servers, and 4.x servers configured for
  bindery emulation.

- Graphical logon to NetWare 2.2, 3.x, and 4.x bindery - Logon to Windows 95 is
  linked to a NetWare bindery-based server. This logs users on to the Windows
  95 system and to their preferred NetWare server. In addition, a user can be
  validated for the Windows 95 system by their preferred server by making the
  Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks the primary logon.

- Supports Large Internetwork Packet (LIP) protocol - NetWare clients and
  servers negotiate packet size when a client attaches to a server. Previously,
  if a server identified a router between itself and the client, the packet
  size was set to 576 bytes. LIP allows the client and server to negotiate the
  packet size used when communication occurs through a router. With LIP, the
  packet size depends on the maximum physical packet size common to both the
  client and the server. LIP is enabled between Windows 95-based computers
  running the Microsoft Client for NetWare Networks and either NetWare 3.12 or
  4.x servers or Windows 95 NCP servers.
