SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to set up a floppy disk boot server-based
installation of Windows 95 using any of the following networks:

- Microsoft LAN Manager

- Microsoft Windows NT

- Novell NetWare

NOTE: This article applies to only the retail version of Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Before you can set up a floppy disk boot server-based installation of Windows
95, you must accomplish the following items:

- All the Windows 95 files must be copied to the server using the Netsetup.exe
  tool.

- You must have a real-mode connection to the server.

- You must have a drive mapped to the Windows 95 folder on the server.

- You must have a drive mapped to a home directory on the server where
  individual user folders and files are to be placed.

- You must have full access rights to the home directory.

To set up a floppy disk boot server-based installation, use the following steps:

1. Create an Msbatch.inf file and store it in any accessible location. You can
  create an Msbatch.inf file using Netsetup.exe or Batch.exe. To create an
  Msbatch.inf file using Batch.exe, follow these steps:

  a. Run Batch.exe from the Netsetup folder on the Windows 95 CD-ROM.

  b. Click Network Options.

  c. Click Enable Server Based Setup, then click Floppy Disk Boot.

  d. Click Done. Save the file with an .inf extension.

  NOTE: You can store the Msbatch.inf file in any location that is accessible to
  users. You can choose any other options to automate Setup, but users who use
  such an .inf file will have no choice but to use the parameters specified in
  the file.

  To create an Msbatch.inf file using Netsetup.exe, follow these steps:

  a. Run Netsetup.exe from the Netsetup folder on the Windows 95 CD-ROM.

  b. Click the Make Script button.

  c. Enter a filename and location for the .inf file, then click OK.

  d. Click Install Location.

  e. Click the Server Based Setup check box to select it.

  f. Click the Store Windows dialog box, then click On The Server.

  g. Click Boot Device, then click Floppy Boot.

  h. Click any other options you want to use to automate Setup.

  i. Click OK.

  NOTE: You can choose any other options to automate Setup. However, any user
  who runs Setup pointing to such an .inf file will have no choice but to use
  the parameters specified in the file. You can save the file with any
  eight-character name, but the extension must be .inf.

2. Change to the Windows 95 folder on the network server and run Setup.exe
  specifying the script file you want to use. Use the syntax

  setup &lt;path&gt;:\&lt;filename&gt;.inf

  where &lt;path&gt; is the path for the script file, and &lt;filename&gt; is
  the name for the script file.

  NOTE: The .inf file can be in any location. If you do not specify an .inf
  file, Setup uses the default .inf file located in the Windows 95 directory on
  the server.

  During the installation process, Setup prompts you to enter the location of
  the machine folder. Enter a path from your home directory. For example, if
  you have mapped drive E to your home directory on the server, you could
  enter:

  e:\&lt;username&gt;


  If prompted, choose Custom Setup, and then choose to specify your network
  adapter and network adapter settings when you are prompted by Setup.

  After Setup finishes copying files, you are prompted to insert a blank disk
  for the startup files. After you do so and the startup files are copied,
  Windows 95 restarts from the startup disk. When Windows 95 starts, you
  receive the following error message:

  Error: 0001 The section corresponding to this workstation could not be found
  in the MACHINES.INI

1. Edit the Autoexec.bat file on the startup disk. Map a drive to your home
  directory on the network server in the Autoexec.bat file.

2. Edit the Machines.ini file located in the Windows 95 folder on the network
  server. Add the following lines to the file:

     [node address]         - This is the 12-digit node address listed
                              when you boot from the startup disk.

     Sysdatpath=&lt;path&gt;      - This is the path to the machine folder
                              in your home directory that you created
                              in step 2.

     &lt;X&gt;=\\&lt;server&gt;\&lt;share&gt; - This is the path to the Windows 95
                              directory on the server.

3. Reboot your computer using the startup disk. Setup will finish.
