-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you try to shut down Windows 95 while PowerPoint for Windows 95, version
7.0 has an unsaved presentation open, you may encounter the following error
message:

  This program is not responding. It may be busy, waiting for a response from
  you, or it may have stopped running.

- Click Cancel to ignore and return to Windows.

- To close this program immediately, click End Task. You will lose any unsaved
  information in this program.

- To give the program 20 seconds to finish what it is doing, click Wait, and
  then try to close the program again.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior is by design. Windows 95 uses this method to alert you that you
are in the middle of a shut down, that you have an application still running,
and that some type of user intervention is necessary. (You have 20 seconds in
which to save the file before this error dialog box appears.)

RESOLUTION
==========

To exit the dialog box, select one of the choices provided as best suits your
needs.


MORE INFORMATION
================

PowerPoint 97 behaves differently. If you try to shut down Windows 95 while you
have an unsaved presentation in PowerPoint, you see the message:

  Do you want to save the changes you made to the (Unsaved Presentation)?

Whether you click Yes, No, or Cancel, the Windows 95 shutdown routine stops.
