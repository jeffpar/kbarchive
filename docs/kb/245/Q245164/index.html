The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server, Enterprise Edition version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to load some Tag Image File Format (TIFF) files into the
imaging program included with Windows NT 4.0 (Wangimg.exe), the operation is
unsuccessful and a "The file is open and being used by another application"
error message is displayed even though no other program actually has the file
open.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because TIFF files stored in some compression formats are
not decompressed correctly by the imaging software.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem.

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information on support costs, please go to the following address on the World
Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English-language version of this fix should have the following file
attributes or later:

  Date       Time    Size      File name      Platform
  ----------------------------------------------------
  11/01/99   19:39    70,416   Oigfs400.dll   Intel
  11/01/99   19:38   115,472   Oigfs400.dll   Alpha



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior decompress the TIFF file using an alternative
imaging tool (such as the viewer included with Microsoft Windows 98), and then
save the file in an alternative format.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
