-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Updated collection (.psd) files go to every child site when a new child site is
added. This behavior can create a significant amount of inter-site traffic if
there are a lot of collections and a lot of existing child sites. Additionally,
Collection Evaluator does not perform any other work while it is processing
these collection update requests.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, use the appropriate method.

Method 1: Using the Hotfix Installer
------------------------------------

NOTE: This method is only for Intel-based computers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a share on your network. The Q245051.exe
  file is a Microsoft Windows Installer file that updates specific files on
  your site server.

2. Log on to your site server using an account with administrative privileges.

3. On the site server, close the Systems Management Server Administrator
  console.

4. Run Q245051.exe and follow the directions in the wizard. You can run the file
  in Quiet mode by using the /s switch.

Method 2: Manual Installation
-----------------------------

1. Stop the Systems Management Server Site Component Manager and Systems
  Management Server Executive services.

2. Replace the Colleval.dll file in the
  &lt;Sms_root_folder&gt;\Bin\&lt;Platform&gt; folder with the version obtained
  from the hotfix.

3. Restart the Systems Management Server Site Component Manager and Systems
  Management Server Executive services.

NOTE: When a new child site is attached, collection evaluator at the parent site
will now send updated collection files to the new child site only.
