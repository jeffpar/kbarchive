-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Setup method discussed in the following Microsoft Knowledge
Base article, client connection account lockouts may occur when clients are
being installed on the secondary site. This occurs only if SQL server is not
installed before you install Systems Management Server (SMS) on the primary
site.

  Windows NT Domains

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, install SQL Server before you install a primary
site instead of using SMS Setup to start the SQL Server installation.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The method included with the fix described in the following Microsoft Knowledge
Base article (also included with SMS 2.0 SP1) introduces new Setup switches for
secondary sites so that you can specify accounts to reduce the number of
accounts in a domain with multiple sites. This installation method, when
combined with automatic SQL Server installation using SMS Setup, can cause the
client connection account to be locked out for secondary sites:
