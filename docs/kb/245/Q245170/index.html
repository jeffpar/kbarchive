If an offer (.ofr) file is listed in a client's instruction (.ins) file, but is
missing from the Client Access Point (CAP) or is damaged, the client computer
generates an error 10000 status message when the offer data providers (ODPs)
enumerate the available offers. When this happens, no other valid advertisements
run until the problem is resolved.

==========

Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
