SYMPTOMS
========

After you apply the hotfix that is described in the following Microsoft
Knowledge Base article, the screen saver on clients running Microsoft Windows 95
or Microsoft Windows 98 may not start:

  Q193269 SMS: Remote Control to Win9x Clients Fails w/Winsock2, Using IP

This problem occurs only if you start Wuser9x.exe and then quit it by using the
Close button (X) in the Remote Control Status dialog box.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Systems Management Server service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

STATUS
======

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, use the appropriate method.

Using the Hotfix Installer
--------------------------

NOTE: This method is only for Intel-based Systems Management Server (SMS) site
server computers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a share on your network. Q245816.exe is a
  Microsoft Windows Installer file that updates specific files on your site
  server.

2. Log on to your site server using an account with administrative privileges.

3. Run Q245816.exe and follow the instructions in the wizard.

Manual Installation
-------------------

For a manual installation, you must:

- Stop the SMS site services.

- Copy the Windows 95/Windows 98 remote control files to the site server.

- Modify the System.map file to support the new files.

- Restart the SMS site services, and allow the site to propagate the changes to
  the rest of the site.

- Upgrade the clients.

To do this, follow these steps:

1. Stop the SMS_EXECUTIVE, SMS_SITE_CONFIG_MANAGER, and SMS_HIERARCHY_MANAGER
  SMS server services on the site server.

2. Copy the following files to your site server's
  Sms\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\X86.bin folder:

  Cli_dos.exe
  Coexst9x.dll
  Idisp9x.dll
  Idispthk.dll
  Imp9x.dll
  Loc16vc0.dll
  Multpr9x.dll
  Queue9x.dll
  Vuser9x.vxd
  Woudat9x.dll
  Wuser9x.exe

3. Copy the following files to your site server's
  Sms\Site.srv\Maincfg.box\Client.src\X86.bin\&lt;Language&gt; folder:

  Cl_w95.mod
  Wumsg9x.dll
  _Idisp9x.dll
  _Wuser9x.dll

4. Copy the following file to your site server's Sms\Site.srv\&lt;Platform&gt;
  folder:

  Sightnt.dll

5. Make a backup copy of the current System.map file.

6. You must remove 16-bit Wuser support for Windows 95/Windows 98. To do this,
  scan the System.map file looking for the Wuser.exe entry in the section
  titled:

  DIRECTORY "SITE.SRV\MAINCFG.BOX\CLIENT.SRC\X86.BIN" PLATFORM "INTEL X86"
  LANGUAGE "" SOURCE "X86\INTNL" FLAGS = 10 UNIT = "INTEL CLIENT"

7. Remove Wuser.exe from the WIN95 CopyList entry. To do this, locate the line
  for Wuser.exe. Change the following line from

  REMOTE=YES, COPYLISTS("WIN16:REMOTE_CONTROL" = "SMS", "WIN95:REMOTE_CONTROL"
  = "SMS"), COMPRESS=NO, FLAGS = 5

to:

  REMOTE=YES, COPYLISTS("WIN16:REMOTE_CONTROL" = "SMS"), COMPRESS=NO, FLAGS = 5

8. Remove Vuser.386 from the WIN95 CopyList entry. To do this, locate the line
  for Vuser.386. Change the following line from

  REMOTE=YES, COPYLISTS("WIN16:REMOTE_CONTROL_386" = "WINDIR",
  "WIN95:REMOTE_CONTROL_386" = "WINDIR"), COMPRESS=NO, FLAGS = 1

to:

  REMOTE=YES, COPYLISTS("WIN16:REMOTE_CONTROL_386" = "WINDIR"), COMPRESS=NO,
  FLAGS = 1

9. You must remove 16-bit Wuser support for Windows 95/98. To do this, scan the
  System.map file, looking for the _wuser.dll entry in the section titled:

  DIRECTORY "SITE.SRV\MAINCFG.BOX\CLIENT.SRC\X86.BIN\00000409" PLATFORM "INTEL
  X86" LANGUAGE "ENGLISH" SOURCE "X86\ENGLISH" FLAGS = 10 UNIT = "INTEL CLIENT"

10. Remove _wuser.dll from the WIN95 CopyList entry. To do this, locate the line
  for _wuser.dll. Change the following line from

  REMOTE=YES, COPYLISTS("WIN16:REMOTE_CONTROL" = "SMS", "WIN95:REMOTE_CONTROL"
  = "SMS"), COMPRESS=NO, FLAGS = 5

to:

  REMOTE=YES, COPYLISTS("WIN16:REMOTE_CONTROL" = "SMS"), COMPRESS=NO, FLAGS = 5

11. Merge the new additions that are located in the enclosed Hotfix.map file.
  The headers for each section in the Hotfix.map file are included for
  reference, but you only need to merge the new lines into the appropriate
  matching section in the System.map file.

  NOTE: Pay attention to these headers because some may look similar but are
  not the same. Look for Wuser.exe on an Intel platform and Wusermsg.dll for
  the same platform, and then merge into those areas.

12. Restart the SMS services on the site server.

13. Wait for the copylist files to be upgraded from the System.map file. This
  should take about 10 minutes on an average site.

14. Run Runsms, Smsls, or Upgrade to install or upgrade the Windows 95/Windows
  98 client.
