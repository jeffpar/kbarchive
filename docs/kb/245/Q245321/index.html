-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.2, 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you are running System Management Server (SMS) with Remote Control
installed, Windows NT may generate the following error message:

  Stop 0x0000000A (0x00373039 , 0x00000002, 0x00000001, 0x8010ab20

CAUSE
=====

This error message occurs when the SMS Remote Control driver (Rchelp.sys)
overruns a memory buffer during the loading of the driver.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this issue, remove SMS 2.0 Remote Control. You must remove Remote
Control completely; if you simply rename or delete the Rchelp.sys file, SMS
reinstalls the file during its regular check of the client once every 30 days.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in
Systems Management Server version 1.2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Rchelp.sys file is not necessary on versions of Microsoft Windows NT later
than Windows NT 4.0 SP2. Microsoft has confirmed that having the Rchelp.sys file
installed on these systems is a problem.

How to Install the Hotfix
-------------------------

1. Create a folder in a location that is accessible to your SMS site server.

2. Copy Q246549.exe and platform folders to the new folder. The folder structure
  must be such that the executable file is located one folder higher than the
  platform folders.

3. Log on to your site server using an account with administrative privileges.

4. From each of the primary and secondary SMS site servers in your environment,
  run the executable file.

5. Finish any necessary manual installation steps as prescribed by the
  installation.

NOTE: You can run the Q246549.exe file using the /s comand-line switch.

How to Manually Install the Hotfix
----------------------------------

1. Copy the updated SMS files to a disk or network share that is accessible from
  the SMS site server you want to update.

2. Close the SMS Administrator console and stop all SMS services from within
  Control Panel. If the SMS_SITE_BACKUP service is running, stop that as well.

3. Copy the Remctrl.exe file from the appropriate &lt;platform&gt; subfolder
  into the &lt;driveletter&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Remctrl\&lt;platform&gt;
  folder.

4. Replace the Compver.ini file in the
  &lt;driveletter&gt;\Sms\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Remctrl folder with the
  Compver1118.ini file located in the hotfix bundle source folder (after you
  rename this file to Compver.ini).

5. Restart the SMS Site services.

The new files are replicated to all logon points and Client Access Points (CAPs).
After all logon points and CAPs are updated, allow an additional 23 hours for
clients to begin their update polling cycle. You may need to restart the client
to load the updated acceleration driver.
