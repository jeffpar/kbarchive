IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install Outlook Web Access (OWA) with a firewall between the
Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS)/OWA server and the Exchange Server
computer, you receive the following error message:

  There are no more endpoints available from the endpoint mapper.

CAUSE
=====

During the installation of OWA, the Exchange Server installation program needs
to bind to the system attendant on the Exchange Server computer. If the port for
the system attendant is being blocked by the firewall, the installation does not
work.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, statically map the system attendant port on the
Exchange Server computer, and then open that port on the firewall. This allows
the installation program to bind to the system attendant during installation. To
do so requires you to restart the Exchange Server services. The instructions for
statically mapping the system attendant port on the Exchange Server computer
follow:

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following subkey:

  SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeSA\Parameters

3. Add the registry value, TCP/IP port, as a DWORD value, and specify the port
  to be used. The RADIX should be set to decimal when you enter the value.

  NOTE: The DWORD value should be in decimal. The port must be above 1024.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

attendant port, click the article number below to view the article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

You should also statically map the information store and the directory service,
and open those ports on the firewall.
