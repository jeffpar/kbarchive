-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you enable a gateway in Gateway Services for NetWare (GSNW) on a Microsoft
Windows NT Server 4.0-based server and then restart the server, the shares that
are located on a Novell NetWare server may appear to be deleted on the Windows
NT Server 4.0-based server. When you perform a trace by using Network Monitor,
the trace may show that the Windows NT Server 4.0-based server is sending out a
'Find Name to servername' broadcast to the NetWare server, but is not receiving
any response from the NetWare server.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if you use a Cisco router and the Cisco router
interferes with the request to find the NetWare server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, set the router port for 'Spantree PortFast'. For
information about Cisco routers, visit the following Cisco Web site:

  http://www.cisco.com

third-party contact information.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If other Windows NT Server 4.0-based servers with the GSNW service installed are
affected in the same way, the router hardware may be the cause of the problem.
To test this, insert a hub between the Windows NT Server 4.0-based server and
the Cisco router to see whether the problem still occurs.
