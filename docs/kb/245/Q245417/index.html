-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.x 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes a procedure to recover Microsoft Schedule+ version 1.0
information that a user has lost because of a catastrophic event such as a local
hard disk failure with no back up, or a lost computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use this procedure if the following conditions existed when the
Schedule+ 1.0 information was lost:

- The mail message file (MMF) was stored on the server.

- The user was using Microsoft Mail (MS Mail) 3.x.

- The user was using Schedule+ 1.0.

To recover lost Schedule+ 1.0 information:

1. Install the new operating system on the user's computer. The new operating
  system does not need to be the same operating system that was previously
  used.

2. Install MS Mail 3.x.

3. Install Schedule+.

4. Map a drive to the user's postoffice, where drive M is mapped to the root of
  the Maildata folder.

5. Start Schedule+.

6. In the dialog box, type the user's mailbox name.

7. In the next prompt dialog box, type the user's password.

After you perform these steps, the computer pauses, and then automatically loads
all old information from both messaging and calendar files from the server. The
user's Schedule+ information should now be current.

After this procedure, if you want to, you can add the following universal naming
convention (UNC) statement to the Msmail.ini file (located in the Windows
folder)

  &lt;server_path&gt;=\\&lt;server&gt;\&lt;share&gt;

and then remove the drive M mapping.
