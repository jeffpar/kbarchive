SUMMARY
=======

Serengeti Systems Incorporated offers a Hayes AutoSync2 compatible link service
for SNA Server that allows an SDLC connection through an asynchronous
communication port. It is specific to Hayes AutoSync2 and does not support
earlier versions of Hayes AutoSync.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Link Service requires a Hayes Optima 33.6 or 56kb modem with AutoSync2
support. The part number for the 33.6 modem is 08-02688 and the 56kb modem is
08-02892. These are the only two modems that this link service works with.

To install the link service, do the following:

1. Run the setup routine provided with the software. You will be prompted for a
  password, which must be entered.

2. Install the Link Service in SNA Server by choosing Insert, and then selecting
  Link Service.

3. Open the property sheet for the link service and choose Run License Manager.

4. Choose First Run Authorization. This provides a 7-day window of activation.
  After 7 days, it is necessary to contact Serengeti Systems Incorporated to
  obtain a Full License Authorization.

5. The Link service is SSIAUTOx and is configured with the necessary
  initialization strings, COM port settings, and dial mode settings. The
  default initialization strings should work without modification. The phone
  number to dial is configured in the Connection Properties. COM1 through
  COM256 are supported, as well as tone or pulse dial.

To configure a connection, do the following:

1. Choose Insert Connection, and then choose SDLC.

2. On the general sheet of the Connection Properties, select SSIAUTOx.

3. Select the Address sheet, and then enter the phone number to dial in the Dial
  Data field.

All other settings are configured as with any other SDLC connection.
Tracing is accomplished through the trace utility or a built-in trace function
that has the capability to trace the Link Service and/or the Device Driver, and
is enabled thorough the Link Service Properties sheet.

The Link Service Software is removed using the Add/Remove program in Control
Panel.
