SUMMARY
=======

To support repair, installation on demand, and reinstallation in Microsoft
Outlook 2000, you must control the way that Outlook files are changed. When you
merely replace a file with a newer version of the file, if an issue occurs, the
system does not repair the newer file; the newer file is replaced by the old
version of the file. An additional consequence of replacing a file with a newer
version of the file is that if you uninstall a feature, the newer file is no
longer necessary and is deleted by the installer, and you lose the update in any
future reinstallations of the feature.

The proper way to distribute a patch is as a Windows Installer Patch file, which
usually has an .msp extension. This file includes all of the information that is
necessary to patch the administrative and client installations of one or more
products.

MORE INFORMATION
================

You can use different options to apply the changes in a Windows Installer Patch
file, depending on your situation.

Stand-Alone Installation
------------------------

This information applies to Outlook installations from a CD. If you installed
Outlook from an administrative image that is located on a network share, patch
the administrative image by following the instructions in the "Administrative
Image" section of this article.

To apply the patch for a stand-alone installation, in Windows Explorer,
double-click the .msp file. The Microsoft Office 2000 Maintenance Mode Wizard
starts. The patch runs immediately and installs the updated files.

Administrative Image
--------------------

To patch the administrative image, run the following command line:

  start msiexec /a &lt;path to network image .msi file&gt; /p &lt;path to patch
  .msp file&gt; SHORTFILENAMES=1

Where &lt;path to network image .msi file&gt; is the full path to the .msi file
in the administrative image, and &lt;path to patch .msp file&gt; is the path to
the Windows Installer Patch file.

This command updates the administrative image. Any subsequent installations from
this image will include the latest version of the files.

The following is a sample command line:

  start msiexec /a \\servername\installfolder\data1.msi /p c:\oqfe2051.msp
  SHORTFILENAMES=1

Updating Computers Where Outlook Was Installed from the Original Administrative Image
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At every computer where Outlook was installed from the administrative image
before the patch was applied, you need to update the system by using one of the
following methods:

- At the computer that you want to update, run the following command:

  start msiexec /I &lt;path to updated .msi file in the server&gt;
  REINSTALL=ALL REINSTALLMODE=vomus

  Where &lt;path to updated .msi file in the server&gt; is the full path to the
  .msi file on the network.

  The following is a sample command line:

  start msiexe /I \\servername\installfolder\data1.msi REINSTALL=ALL
  REINSTALLMODE=vomus

- Use the Repair Office feature:

  1. In Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs.

  2. In the list of installed programs, click Microsoft Outlook 2000.

  3. Click Add/Remove, and then click Repair Office.

  4. Click "Repair errors in my Office installation", and then click Finish.
