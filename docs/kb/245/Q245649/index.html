-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server (SMS) License Server Manager (a thread of the SMS
Executive), is responsible for maintaining Software Metering Servers on a
reoccurring basis. If the following conditions exist, License Server Manager
causes Microsoft Windows NT-based Backup Domain Controllers (BDCs) to request
full synchronizations of the SAM, BUILTIN, and LSA databases every 15 minutes:

- The SMS Site Server is a Windows NT-based BDC.

- The SMS Site Server is configured as a Software Metering Server.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, remove the SMS Software Metering role from your
Windows NT-based BDCs. Note that if Software Metering is desired in a site, you
can configure a member server for that role and specify a local account on that
member server in place of a domain account.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To install the hotfix, use the appropriate method.

Using the Hotfix Installer
--------------------------

NOTE: This method is only for I386-based computers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a share on your network. Q245649.exe is a
  Microsoft Windows Installer file that updates specific files on your site
  server.

2. Log on to your site server by using an account with administrative
  privileges.

3. On the site server, quit the Systems Management Server Administrator console.

4. Run Q245649.exe, and then follow the instructions in the wizard. You can run
  the file in Quiet mode by using the /s switch.

Manual Installation

-------------------

1. Quit the Systems Management Server Administrator console and stop all SMS
  services.

2. Replace the Licsvcfg.dll file in the
  &lt;sms_root_directory&gt;\bin\&lt;platform_name&gt; folder on your site
  server with the version obtained from the hotfix, where
  &lt;sms_root_directory&gt; is your SMS root directory, and
  &lt;platform_name&gt; is the appropriate platform.

3. Restart the SMS services.
