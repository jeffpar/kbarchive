-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Exchange Connector for Novell GroupWise, the message
flow from GroupWise to Exchange Server may fail. A zero-byte file appears in the
Api_out folder of the API Gateway folder. This file disappears after the API
gateway is stopped.

If you try to open this file, it is locked by another process. However, the API
gateway seems as if it did not finish processing the file because the API
gateway log file ends with the following line:

  &lt;date&gt; &lt;time&gt; Processing outbound message...

Directory synchronization and mail flow from Exchange Server to GroupWise are
unaffected.

CAUSE
=====

The problem is occurring on the GroupWise system and there are two possible
causes:

- The &lt;Exchange&gt; Domain was set up as "External GroupWise."

- The &lt;Exchange&gt; Domain is corrupted.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the GroupWise administrator program, delete and recreate the domain for
Exchange Server, and ensure that it is created as an "External Foreign" domain.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To test API functionality independent of Exchange Server, refer to Novell
