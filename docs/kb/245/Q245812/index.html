- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 SP1

SYMPTOMS
========

If you apply or upgrade to Systems Management Server version 2.0 Service Pack 1
on a client computer, you may install Microsoft Visual C++ 6 (6.00.8168.0)
version of the run-time libraries. This can lead to heap compatibility problems
in third-party programs installed on the client using the run-time libraries as
outlined in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:

  Q190536 Invalid Page Fault in Msvcrt.dll

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Systems Management Server service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.



WORKAROUND
==========

To workaround this problem, manually replace the run-time libraries on the
client with VC++ 6 Service Pack 3 (6.0.8447.0) or later.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.
