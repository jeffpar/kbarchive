SYMPTOMS
========

After you exclude mailboxes in Mailbox Manager, when you click OK, it results in
an access violation. You may also experience an access violation when you first
click the Exclude button in Mailbox Manager.

CAUSE
=====

One or more of the excluded mailboxes are without proxy e-mail addresses of any
kind.

Mailbox Manager uses a placeholder proxy address to indicate whether a given
mailbox should be included or excluded from a clean operation. For additional
information, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q242212 XADM: Mailbox Manager Mailbox Exclusion Information Stored Using MBX
  Proxy Address

Mailbox Manager loops through the list of proxy addresses looking for this
placeholder address (MBX:1 = don't clean, MBX:0 or no "MBX"-style address =
clean). In the case where a mailbox has no proxy address, a MAPI error code is
returned in place of the count of proxy addresses on a given mailbox. The error
code happens to be 2147746063 (0x8004010F) or MAPI_E_NOT_FOUND, which is
accurate. In this case, the count of proxy addresses is unavailable because it's
zero. The fix involves ensuring that mailboxes without proxy addresses are
ignored from the exclude list.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

Place a temporary e-mail address in the mailboxes that do not have one. The
address does not need to be valid. There only needs to be something in the field
so that the value is not null.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 3. This problem was first corrected in Exchange Server
5.5 Service Pack 4.

Additional query words: mbclean.exe mbclean.dll mbclean
