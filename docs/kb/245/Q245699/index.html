SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade a computer running Windows NT Server and Routing and Remote
Access Service (RRAS) to Windows NT Service Pack 6 (SP6), the RRAS configuration
can no longer be saved. When you attempt to save an RRAS configuration by
selecting Save Configuration from the Server menu drop down list, you receive
the following error message:

  An error occurred while backing up the configuration. The filename, directory
  name, or volume label syntax is incorrect. If you are saving the
  configuration of a remote computer, then the directory and drive in which you
  are saving the configuration must exist on both the local and remote
  computers.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Windows NT 4.0 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
