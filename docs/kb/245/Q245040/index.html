- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how to use the Ntrights.exe utility to restrict access to
a workstation to only the Local Administrators group. Ntrights.exe, a utility
program included in the Resource Kit for Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, enables you
to grant or revoke any Windows NT right to or from a user or group of users.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: To be able to set a right for a user or group, you must have Administrator
privileges.

To restrict access to a workstation to only the Local Administrators group, type
the following commands at the command prompt, pressing ENTER after each line

    ntrights -r SeInteractiveLogonRight -u ''Backup Operators'' - m workstation_name
    ntrights -r SeInteractiveLogonRight -u ''Everyone'' - m workstation_name
    ntrights -r SeInteractiveLogonRight -u ''Guests'' - m workstation_name
    ntrights -r SeInteractiveLogonRight -u ''Power Users'' - m workstation_name
    ntrights -r SeInteractiveLogonRight -u ''Users'' - m workstation_name

where workstation_name is the name of the workstation you want to restrict.

These commands remove the right to log on to the workstation locally from every
group except the Local Administrators group. If you are working from a
workstation that you want to restrict, you do not have to use the -m parameter,
because the changes are made to the local workstation by default. However, when
you want to use these commands on a remote computer, you must use the -m
parameter, along with the name of the computer. To make all of the changes at
once, create a batch file with these commands and include the names of all
required workstations.

To view a list of all the available rights and for additional information about
how to use the Ntrights.exe utility, either view the documentation that
accompanies the Windows NT 4.0 Resource Kit, or type the following command at a
command prompt, and then press ENTER:

  ntrights /?

Additional query words: permissions rights local
