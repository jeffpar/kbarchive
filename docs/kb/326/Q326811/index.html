-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft ODBC Driver for DB2 to link a table from Microsoft Access
(all versions), you may get incorrect values when the selected fields are
defined as DATE data type fields.

CAUSE
=====

The Micorosft ODBC Driver for DB2 is returning a SQL_TYPE_DATE,TIME,TIMESTAMP
data type.

This data type is not known by Microsoft Access (all versions), because Access is
only ODBC 2.0 compliant. Microsoft Access maps this data type to the default
data type TEXT.

RESOLUTION
==========

Host Integration Server 2000
----------------------------

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Only apply it to systems
that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft
recommends that you wait for the next Host Integration Server 2000 service pack
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The usual support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix has the file attributes (or later) that are
listed in the following table. The dates and times for these files are listed in
coordinated universal time (UTC). When you view the file information, it is
converted to local time. To find the difference between UTC and local time, use
the Time Zone tab in the Date and Time tool in Control Panel.

  Date         Time   Version      Size      File name
  ---------------------------------------------------------
  21-Jun-2002  17:13  5.0.0.866    880.912   Mseidb2d.dll       

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.
