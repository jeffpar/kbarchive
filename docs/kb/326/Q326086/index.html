SUMMARY
=======

This step-by-step article describes how to isolate Internet Information Server
(IIS) 4.0 and Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 applications into their
own respective processes.

In this article, all isolation steps are performed at the Web site level instead
of at the virtual directory level. If an application needs isolation at the
virtual directory level, follow the same steps, but use the Virtual Directory
tab instead of the Home Directory tab.

IIS 4.0
-------

1. Click Start, point to Program Files, click Windows NT 4.0 Option Pack, click
  Microsoft Internet Information Server, and then click Internet Service
  Manager.

2. In the Internet Service Manager (ISM), right-click the Web site that you want
  to isolate, and then click Properties.

3. In the Web site property sheet, click the Home Directory tab.

4. On the Home Directory tab, click to select the Run in separate memory space
  check box.

5. Click OK.

NOTE: Because the IIS services are already running and the site is currently in
the Inetinfo (Inetinfo.exe) process, you must restart the IIS services. You do
not have to do this right away. To do this:

6. Click Start, click Run, type "cmd" (without the quotation marks), and then
  click Run.

7. At the command prompt, type "net stop iisadmin /y" (without the quotation
  marks).

8. When the services complete shutting down, type the following to restart each
  individual service that is installed:

   - WWW: "net start w3svc" (without the quotation marks)

   - File Transfer Protocol (FTP): "net start msftpsvc" (without the quotation
     marks)

   - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP): "net start smtpsvc" (without the
     quotation marks)

   - Network News Transfer Protocol (NNTP): "net start nntpsvc" (without the
     quotation marks)

IIS 5.0
-------

1. Click Start, click Program Files, click Administrative Tools, and then click
  Internet Services Manager.

2. In the ISM, right-click the Web site that you want to isolate, and then click
  Properties.

3. In the Web site property sheet, click the Home Directory tab.

4. Under Application Settings, click High (Isolated) in the Application
  Protection drop-down list.

5. Click OK.

NOTE: Because the IIS services are already running and this site is probably
loaded in the DLLHost process that is already running, you must restart the IIS
services. You do not have to do this right away. To do this:

6. In the ISM, right-click the server name, and then click Restart IIS.

7. Click OK.
