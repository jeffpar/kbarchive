The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Zoo Tycoon 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start a new game of Zoo Tycoon, there are fewer animals and buildings
available than you expected.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because most of the scenarios start with three to eight
animals and a few buildings.

RESOLUTION
==========

You have to complete the research and conservation programs before you can build
new buildings and adopt new kinds of animals. Click "Research and Conservation"
to increase funding in this area. You receive messages at the top of the screen
when new animals and buildings are available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

For more information about research and conservation in Zoo Tycoon, press F1 to
start Help while playing Zoo Tycoon, and then click "Research and Conservation"
in the list of topics.
