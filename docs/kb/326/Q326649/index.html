Last Modified: 14-AUG-2002

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
- Microsoft SNA Server, version 4.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you 
modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore 
the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the 
registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

After you upgrade COM Transaction Integrator (COMTI) to SNA Server version 4.0
Service Pack (SP) 4 or to Host Integration Server 2000, COMTI applications that
use Customer Information Control System (CICS) LINK over logical unit (LU) 6.2
with SNA Server 4.0 SP 3 or earlier may not communicate correctly with the host
transaction program.

CAUSE
=====

On a mainframe computer that has CICS installed, terminals that are connected to
one CICS region (a Terminal Owning Region [TOR]) can run transactions on another
CICS region (an Application Owning Region [AOR]).

With versions earlier than SNA Server 4.0 SP 4, if the program that is being
called is to be run in an AOR, COMTI always passes the default CICS mirror
transaction ID to the AOR.

In SNA Server 4.0 SP 4 and Host Integration Server 2000, COMTI always passes the
Source TP Name that is on the Host Names tab of the Method Properties in the
COMTI Component Builder as the mirror transaction ID that is to be used by the
AOR.

Because of this change, COMTI applications that rely on COMTI to pass the default
CICS mirror transaction ID to the AOR do not work correctly after COMTI is
upgraded to SNA Server 4.0 SP 4 or to Host Integration Server 2000.

RESOLUTION
==========

SNA Server 4.0 SP 4
-------------------

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem that is described in this article. Apply it only to
computers that are experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive
additional testing. Therefore, if you are not severely affected by this problem,
Microsoft recommends that you wait for the next Microsoft SNA Server 4.0 SP 4
that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, visit the following Microsoft
Web site:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are ordinarily incurred for support calls
may be canceled if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. The typical support costs will apply to
additional support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific
update in question.

The English version of this fix has the file attributes (or later) that are
listed in the following table. The dates and times for these files are listed in
coordinated universal time (UTC). When you view the file information, it is
converted to local time. To find the difference between UTC and local time, use
the Time Zone tab in the Date and Time tool in Control Panel.

  Date         Time   Version      Size    File name
  --------------------------------------------------
  NOV-05-2001  11:29  4.993.0.0   54,447   Dpl1.dll
  NOV-05-2001  11:48  4.993.0.0  133,015   TranLU62.dll

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, the most recent fix that contains the above
files may also contain additional files.



Host Integration Server 2000
----------------------------

No fix is available at this time.


WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, follow these steps:

1. Use the COMTI Component Builder to change the Source TP Name of each method
  to CSMI.

2. Save and redeploy the COMTI component.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

This fix implements a registry key so that COMTI works as it did in SNA Server
4.0 SP 3 and earlier. When this key exists and is set to a value, COMTI always
passes the default CICS mirror transaction ID (CSMI) to the AOR.

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate and then click the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cedar\Defaults

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

  Value name: SourceTPNameOverride
  Data type: REG_SZ
  Value data: True

  NOTE: The actual data value is not checked, but you must enter a data value.

4. Quit Registry Editor.

4 of SNA Server 4.0 and Host Integration Server 2000, click the article number
