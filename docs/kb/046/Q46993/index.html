Consider the following program "fubar.c":

1:  void main(void)
2:      {
3:      char * const String;
4:
5:      *String   = 'a';
6:      String[0] = 'a';
7:      }

Lines 5 and 6 would be expected to have the same effect. However,
compiling

   cl fubar.c

produces the following error message:

   fubar.c(6) : error C2166: lval specifies 'const' object

If the "const" attribute is removed from the declaration of "String",
the error message is eliminated. As per the ANSI C usage of "const",
Lines 5 and 6 should indeed be synonymous.

Response:

Version 5.10's handling of const doesn't quite match the current ANSI
draft, and works inconsistently.

Microsoft is researching this problem and will post new information as
it becomes avialable.

Note: according to ANSI, to create the error on the two lines
consistently, you need to use

   const char * string = "This is a string";

or (equivalently)

   char const * string = "This is a string";

both of which say that "string" points to a const char. The following
line says that the pointer "string" is constant, but the char to which
it points is not -- so no error occurs:

   char * const string = "This is a string";

To make both constant, use the following:

   const char * const string = "This is a string";

Note that the above four examples do not work correctly on Version
5.10. This feature is under review and should be fixed in the next
release.
