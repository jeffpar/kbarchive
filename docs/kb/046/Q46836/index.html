The following questions and answers concern the use of Glockenspiel
C++:

Q. Does Microsoft recommend the Glockenspiel C++ and CommonView?

A. Microsoft has included their advertising literature in our C
Version 5.10 package and has mentioned them in the new languages
newsletter, which was sent to all registered users. Glockenspiel's C++
is a preprocessor, which generates C 5.10 code from your C++ source
program. (You then use Microsoft C 5.10 to compile this code.) This
C++ product is currently the only way to use C++ while retaining the
sophisticated code generation and tool set of Microsoft C. It is ideal
for Microsoft customers who want to use C++ today.

CommonView is a C++ object library, which makes programming for
graphical user interfaces, including Windows, easier. This is also the
only product of its type on the market today that is compatible with
Microsoft C.

The products included here are manufactured by vendors independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these
products' performance or reliability.

Q. What does Microsoft think about C++? Does Microsoft recommend
programming in C++?

A. Microsoft has publicly stated that object-oriented programming,
including C++, is the way of the future and that it will result in
great productivity gains for programmers. We have already introduced
object-oriented extensions in our new QuickPascal product and have
announced that we are working on an implementation of C++ (release
date is unknown). We think that this is very important technology and
that it will make possible the sophisticated systems of tomorrow.

Since C++ is going to be so important in the near future, it is
certainly wise to start getting experience in it now.

Q. Does Microsoft use C++ in-house?

A. Microsoft uses a variety of languages in-house including Microsoft C
and MASM. Beyond that, it is not possible to comment on which products
use what languages.
