The Microsoft Editor Version 1.00 does not implement the Curtime
function correctly. The manual states that the current time will be
inserted at the cursor when this function is invoked. Actually, the
time the editor was invoked is inserted at the cursor. To get around
this problem, simply initialize the editor before calling the Curtime
function.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Version 1.00. This
problem was corrected in Version 1.02 of the Microsoft Editor.

The following macro illustrates how the Curtime function is invoked.
This macro should be placed in the TOOLS.INI file under the [m] tag.

   time:=Curtime
   time:ALT+T

When editing a file, pressing ALT+T inserts the time that the editor
was loaded at the cursor. To obtain the current system time, either
invoke the Initialize function by pressing SHIFT+F8 before ALT+T, or
change the macro as follows:

   time:=Initialize Curtime
   time:ALT+T

Now, pressing ALT+T inserts the current system time at the cursor.

This function is documented on Pages 30 and 96 of the "Microsoft
Editor User's Guide," which is contained in the "CodeView and
Utilities, Microsoft Editor, Mixed-Language Programming Guide" manual
from the Microsoft C Optimizing Compiler Version 5.10.
