SYMPTOMS
========

If Audit scans and finds a match in a path that is 128 characters or greater in
length, the MIF created is not processed by Dataloader and the following error
is logged in the Dataldr.log file:

  Compilation failed~String value exceeds declared or derived size.

CAUSE
=====

The MIF being created by Audit contains a path that is greater than 128
characters. The size defined in SQL for the file path is 128 characters.
