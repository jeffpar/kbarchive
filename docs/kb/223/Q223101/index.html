The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Enterprise Edition for Windows, version 6.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

A UserControl in a project always executes the WriteProperties event prior to
the Resize event. According to Key UserControl Events in the product
documentation at the URL below, the WriteProperties event only executes when the
design-time instance of the control is destroyed or when a property value for
the control is changed:

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article.

This bug was corrected in Visual Studio 6.0 Service Pack 3.

For more information about Visual Studio service packs, please see the following
articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

Q194022 INFO: Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs, What, Where, Why

Q194295 HOWTO: Tell That Visual Studio 6.0 Service Packs Are Installed

MORE INFORMATION
================

This section shows you how to create a sample project that demonstrates the bug
behavior. The section assumes you are familiar with creating ActiveX controls
and adding ActiveX controls to standard projects. If you are not familiar with
these tasks, see the REFERENCES section below for more information.

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

1. Start a new Standard EXE project in Visual Basic. Form1 is created by
  default.

2. From the File menu, add an ActiveX Control project to your Standard EXE
  project. UserControl1 is created by default.

3. Copy the following code to the Code Window of the UserControl:

  Option Explicit

  Private Sub UserControl_ReadProperties(PropBag As PropertyBag)
     Debug.Print "read Properties"
  End Sub

  Private Sub UserControl_Resize()
     Debug.Print "resize"
  End Sub

  Private Sub UserControl_WriteProperties(PropBag As PropertyBag)
     Debug.Print "write Properties"
  End Sub
      

4. Close all the windows associated with ActiveX Control project. The ActiveX
  Control appears on the Toolbox.

5. From the View menu, select Immediate Window.

6. Add the ActiveX Control to Form1 of the Standard EXE project (this causes the
  first resize event to fire.)

7. From the Run menu, select Start, or press the F5 key to run the program.

  The following appears in the Intermediate Window:

  resize
  write Properties
  resize
  read Properties

  The expected behavior is for the Resize Event to fire first, followed by the
  ReadProperties Event. The WriteProperties Event should not fire.
