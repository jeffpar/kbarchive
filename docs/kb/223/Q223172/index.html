SYMPTOMS
========

When you click Voice Control on the Options menu in Encarta Encyclopedia to
enable the Voice Control feature, the "How to Install Voice Control" Help topic
may open in a new Help window, even if the Voice Control feature is already
installed.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the Comctl32.dll file is outdated.

RESOLUTION
==========

NOTE: DO NOT use either of the following methods if Microsoft Internet Explorer
5.0 is installed on your computer. If you do, you may not be able to restart
your computer. Internet Explorer installs its own version of the Comct132.dll
file during Setup. At this time, there is no resolution to this issue if
Internet Explorer 5.0 is installed on your computer. To check the version of
Internet Explorer that is installed on your computer, start Internet Explorer,
and then click About Internet Explorer on the Help menu.

To resolve this issue, copy the Comctl32.dll file from the Installation and
Resources CD-ROM to your hard disk. To do this, use the appropriate method for
your version of Microsoft Windows.

Microsoft Windows 98
--------------------

1. Insert the Microsoft Windows 98 installation CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive.
  Press and hold down the SHIFT key when you insert the CD-ROM to prevent it
  from starting automatically.

2. Click Start, and then click Run.

3. In the Open box, type "sfc" (without the quotation marks), and then click OK.

4. Click "Extract one file from installation disk".

5. In the "Specify the system file you would like to restore" box, type
  "comctl32.dll" (without the quotation marks), and then click Start.

6. In the "Restore from" box, type the following line

  &lt;cd-rom&gt;:\win98

  where &lt;cd-rom&gt; is the drive letter of your CD-ROM drive.

7. In the "Save file in" box, type the following line, and then click OK

  &lt;drive&gt;:\windows\system

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter of the hard disk on which Windows 98
  is installed.

8. Click OK, and then click OK again.

9. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Yes.

Microsoft Windows 95
--------------------

1. Insert the Encarta Installation and Resources CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive.
  Press and hold down the SHIFT key when you insert the CD-ROM to prevent it
  from starting automatically.

2. Click Start, and then click Run.

3. In the Open box, type the following line, and then click OK

  &lt;cd-rom&gt;:\Support\Comctl32

  where &lt;cd-rom&gt; is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive.

4. Right-click the Comctl32.dll file, and then click Copy.

5. Click Start, and then click Run.

6. In the Open box, type "&lt;drive&gt;:\" (without the quotation marks), and
  then click OK, where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter of the hard disk on
  which Windows 95 is installed.

7. On the Edit menu, click Paste.

8. Close all open windows, and then restart the computer.

9. When you see the "Starting Windows 95" message, press F8.

10. On the Windows startup menu, select Command Prompt Only, and then press
  ENTER.

11. At the command prompt, type the following lines, pressing ENTER after you
  type each line:

  cd \windows\system
  ren comctl32.dll comctl32.old
  move &lt;drive&gt;:\comctl32.dll &lt;drive&gt;:\windows\system

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter of the hard disk on which Windows 95
  is installed.

12. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE to restart the computer.
