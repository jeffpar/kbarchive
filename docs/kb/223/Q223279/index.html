-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you use the Exchange Server Administrator program to view the properties of a
mailbox, you may receive the following error message:

  Extension DSAVUADM could not be loaded.
  The extension for MS Exchange Administrator CPU type c1031667 could not be
  loaded.

After you click OK, a window appears with Abort, Retry, Ignore. If you click
Ignore, you can access the mailbox.

The following event may be logged on the server.

  Event ID 2037
  Source: System Attendant
  Description: The file version \\Add-ins\Dsavuad\I386\Dsavuadm.dll installed by
  the local server is not current. Unable to locate the current version on any
  server in the site.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior may be caused by the installation and removal of GroupShield
Exchange on Exchange Server computers. When you open a mailbox object and all of
its associated properties, including the Anti-virus tab that GroupShield
creates, the Exchange Server Administrator program looks for the Dsavuadm.dll
file to display the properties of the Anti-virus tab.

When you install GroupShield, it creates a public folder called Quarantine to
place infected messages in.

Dsavuadm.dll is a Network Associates GroupShield extension.

RESOLUTION
==========

Please contact the software vendor Network Associates (formally McAfee) about
completely removing GroupShield Exchange from your Exchange Server computer, so
that it does not affect other servers in the organization.
