Grammatical Error in Welcome Document Decompression File List
-------------------------------------------------------------

The Excel 5 Courseware Development Kit page that describes how to decompress
files contains an error when referring to CDK_PART CMP.

All text "CDK_PART CMP" in table should be "CDK_PART.CMP." (Note the period just
prior to the .CMP extension is missing from the current syntax.)
