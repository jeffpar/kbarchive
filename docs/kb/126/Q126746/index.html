Changes and New Features
------------------------

Microsoft Windows for Workgroups (WFW) version 3.11 contains all of the
features included in version 3.1 plus the following features:

Network Features:

- NDIS 3.0-specification network drivers: Protect-mode drivers, installed
  as VXDs, using no conventional memory.
- NWLink (and NWNBLink): 32-bit protect-mode protocol for the IPX/SPX
  transport. Routable. NWNBLink adds a NetBIOS layer.
- Novell NetWare ODI connectivity. Full support for IPXODI, monolithic
  IPX, and MSIPX (from WFW 3.1).
- Universal Client Support. Can be configured using Windows network
  drivers to be a client only for all of the networks supported with
  Windows 3.1.
- ADMINCFG: A utility for network administrators. Configures security and
  WFW 3.11 network settings for individual WFW 3.11 workstations remotely.
  Documented primarily in the Windows Resource Kit. Allows the disabling
  of file sharing, print sharing, and network DDE sharing.
- Remote Access Service (RAS). Client software for dialing into a RAS
  server on a Windows NT or LAN Manager server. A Point-to-Point server
  for WFW computers was made available via download later. When a client
  dials into a Windows NT or LAN Manager RAS server, he or she has full
  connectivity into the network. If a client dials into the WFW Point-to-
  Point RAS server, he or she has connectivity to that computer only.
- Real Mode Server for Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS. Allows 8088/8086-based
  computers (and higher) to share their resources (usually as print
  servers). NOTE: The real-mode server is available only in Workgroup Add-
  On for MS-DOS.

Non-Network Features:

- No Network option. WFW can be installed with no network support, much
  like Windows 3.1. Also, WFW 3.11 can be invoked without network
  components (with the WIN /N command) even though installed for a
  network.
- Performance Enhancements (VFAT and VCACHE). WFW 3.11 includes VFAT, a
  32-bit file system that processes INT21h calls for file I/O on local
  disk volumes in protect mode. WFW 3.11 also includes a unified protect-
  mode cache, VCACHE, for both network files accessed by the network
  redirector and local files accessed through VFAT.
- Microsoft At Work PC-Fax. Allows workstations to share fax modems to
  send and receive fax messages using the Microsoft Mail MAPI engine.
- Enhanced Communication Architecture. The architecture of the
  communications interface is more modular. Its components are COMM.DRV,
  *VCD, VCOMM.386, SERIAL.386, and LPT.386. With this new modular design,
  vendors can write device-specific drivers for serial or LPT ports to
  interface with VCOMM.386. It uses the 32-bit interface directly with
  VCOMM.386.
- New troubleshooting switches: WIN /D:C turns off 32-bit file access.
  WIN /D:T skips the *.386 drivers in the [386Enh] section of the
  SYSTEM.INI file.

Available Packages (SKUs)
-------------------------

- Windows for Workgroups 3.11--full retail version (also used to upgrade
  over Windows 2.x and 3.0).
- Workgroup Add-On for Microsoft Windows--upgrade over Windows 3.1 or WFW
  3.1 only.
- Workgroup Add-On for MS-DOS--full retail version (also used to upgrade
  over Workgroup Connection 1.0).

Limitations
-----------

- Real-mode server capabilities available only in Workgroup Add-On for
  MS-DOS, not in WFW 3.11.
- VCACHE caches only local and network hard disks (no CD-ROM or floppy
  drives).
- Standard mode not supported.
