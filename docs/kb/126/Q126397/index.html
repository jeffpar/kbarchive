The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article covers the implications of installing SNA Server on a primary
domain controller/backup domain controller rather than a member server.

MORE INFORMATION
================

SNA Server logs users on to the Windows NT domain before allowing any requests
to be processed, regardless of the transport used by the client to connect to
SNA Server. If SNA Server logs users onto the domain over named pipes, the users
is not prompted for the domain password or username. For other client server
protocols (IPX/SPX, TCP/IP, Banyan, and AppleTalk), the user is prompted for the
domain password and username. As a result, each new client connection to SNA
Server results in a winlogon transaction which, in the case of a member server,
needs to be authenticated across the network by a PDC or BDC. A Windows NT
member server does not maintain the domain user database, and therefore must
rely on a BDC or PDC to validate the user over a secure channel.

If the PDC or BDC spend a large percentage of CPU time servicing winlogon
requests, and the clients generally stay connected to SNA Servers for a long
time, then the administrator should install SNA Server on a member server. If
clients connect and disconnect frequently from SNA Server, and the Windows NT
domain is primarily used for SNA access (as is likely the case when you install
in an existing NetWare or Banyan environment), you should install SNA Server on
the PDC or BDC.

SNA Server to SNA Server Communication Issue:
---------------------------------------------

1. SNA Server Versions 2.11 SP1 and earlier:

  If SNA Servers in the same domain are located across routers, an administrator
  must install SNA Server on a primary domain controller (PDC) or backup domain
  controller (BDC). SNA Server to SNA Server communication is mailslot or
  datagram based. SNA Server uses the winlogon protocols when sending messages
  across routers.

2. SNA Server 3.0 and 4.0:

  SNA Server 3.0 and 4.0 systems in the same domain that are separated by
  routers do not have to be installed on Windows NT domain controllers. SNA
  Server 3.0 and 4.0 Setup prompts for the primary SNA Server's name if it is
  unable to dynamically locate the primary SNA Server based on a UDP broadcast
  datagram.
