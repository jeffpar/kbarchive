SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to start Explorapedia, you may receive an error message similar
to the following:

  Explorapedia error 80048212-0
  An error occurred while starting Explorapedia. Restart Windows and try again.
  If that fails to correct the problem, run Setup from the Explorapedia CD-ROM
  again.

All Explorapedia error messages that start with Explorapedia error 80... or 48...
refer specifically to sound problems.

CAUSE
=====

This error message occurs when an incompatible sound driver is installed on your
computer. Sound drivers that may cause this error message are the DSOUND
Multimedia Wave driver and the PC Speaker driver.


If you have moved the product and/or its components after installation, you may
receive a similar error message. For more information on how to resolve that
problem, see the "More Information" section later in this article.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you have an incompatible sound card driver, you may be able to resolve this
problem by removing the driver.

Use the following steps to remove the DSOUND Multimedia Wave driver or the PC
Speaker driver:

Windows 95/98
-------------

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Multimedia.

3. Click the Advanced or Devices tab.

4. Double-click Audio Devices to expand the branch.

5. Click any of the following drivers, and then click Properties:
   - DSOUND Multimedia Wave Driver

   - Audio for Internal Speaker Wave Driver

   - Audio for Sound Driver for PC-Speaker

6. Click Remove. Repeat step 5 for each driver listed in step 5.

7. Shut down, and then restart the computer.


Windows 3.1
-----------

1. Double-click the Control Panel icon. (Control Panel is usually located in the
  Main program group in Program Manager.)

2. Double-click the Drivers icon.

3. In the Drivers control panel, locate the DSOUND Multimedia Wave Driver or PC
  Speaker Driver on the list of Installed Drivers.

4. Click the driver(s) and then click Remove, which removes the driver from the
  list.

5. Restart Windows.

You should now be able to run Explorapedia successfully.
