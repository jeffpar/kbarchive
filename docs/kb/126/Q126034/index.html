The information in this article applies to:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article contains information on known errors, corrections, and comments
relating to the Microsoft Press book "Running Microsoft Works 3 for Windows."

The following topics are covered:

- Pages 131-391: Various Typographical and Technical Errors

- Page 355: | (Pipe) and ~ (Tilde) Symbols Don't Work

MORE INFORMATION
================

In addition to a description of the book's problems, this document might also
include sections labeled "Correction" and "Comments." Please note that the
"Correction" section is worded for correcting the book and does not necessarily
address the problem introduced by the book error. The "Comments" section
contains specific information for working around problems.

Pages 131-391: Various Typographical and Technical Errors
---------------------------------------------------------

- On page 130, in paragraph 2, the right-align symbol needs to be changed to
  the left-align symbol. In paragraph 4, the left-align symbol needs to be
  changed to the right-align symbol.

- On page 131, in step 1, "1.25-inch" should be changed to "1.5-inch" (see the
  graphic on the same page).

- In the graphic on page 219, the formula bar text should be changed from
  "=SUM(B3:D3)" to "=B3+C3+D3" (see the constructing description on page 218).

- On page 342, the illustration should be changed to show the list sorted by
  Make, Model, and Year.


- On page 391, the illustration does not have aligned columns as the preceding
  steps indicate.

Page 355: | (Pipe) and ~ (Tilde) Symbols Don't Work
---------------------------------------------------

The | and ~ symbols are described on page 355, but they do not work in Works 3.0
for Windows. The pipe symbol is also used on pages 356 and 358.

Correction:

On pages 355 and 356 "#OR#" (without the quotation marks)should be substituted
for the pipe symbol.

On page 355, the third bullet item should be deleted.

On page 358, sentences 2 and 3 should be changed to the following:

  The OR operator (#OR#) is used to find records that match at least one
  condition you specify. NOT EQUAL (&lt;&gt;) is used to find records that do
  not match the conditions you specify.

Comments:

The pipe symbol and the tilde symbol were used in Works 2.0 for Windows. However,
their functionality was not carried over into Works 3.0 for Windows; if you use
these symbols in a database query, you will receive syntax errors.

Use #OR# instead of the | symbol.

Use &lt;&gt; for NOT EQUAL. There are no other common expressions that require
the NOT operator.


Microsoft Press is committed to providing informative and accurate books. All
comments and corrections listed above are ready for inclusion in future
printings of this book. If you have a later printing of this book, it may
already contain most or all of the above corrections.
