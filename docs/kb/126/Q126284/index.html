SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server version 1.0 performance degrades after upgrading to
Windows NT Server version 3.51.

CAUSE
=====

Windows NT version 3.51 includes support for file compression on Windows NT file
system (NTFS) partitions (called Compressed NTFS [CNTFS]). CNTFS is based on a
new compression file attribute. If SMS resides on a CNTFS partition, both SMS
and CNTFS may attempt compression of the same files. This imposes unneeded
overhead.

For example, if the SMS Scheduler compresses a package for distribution, a
compressed data stream is written to a file. If the file attributes have the
compression bit set, CNTFS attempts to compress this data stream when writing to
the disk. Redundant compression attempts waste server resources causing
performance to degrade.

WORKAROUND
==========

To prevent this redundant operation, ensure that directory and file attributes
in the SMS\SITE.SRV directory and subdirectories do not have the compression bit
set. To do this, type the following at the MS-DOS command line:

     COMPACT /U /I /S &lt;x&gt;:\SMS\SITE.SRV\*.*

where &lt;x&gt; is the host drive of the SMS installation. This clears the
compression bit on current files and directories and prevents CNTFS from
compressing the files in the future. SMS still compresses package files
according to its own configuration settings.

NOTE: In addition to file compression on package files, server performance can
also be affected by the compression of files located in the subdirectories below
LOGON.SRV. If these files are compressed by CNTFS, additional server overhead is
required to make the data available to SMS clients.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
versions 1.0 and 1.1. We are researching this problem and will post new
information in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
