The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and AppleTalk Networks, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft provides replacements for the LGTWGET.EXE and LMACGET.EXE program
files that are included in version 3.2 of the Microsoft Mail Connection for PC
and AppleTalk Networks.

For complete information about obtaining and installing the LGTWGET and LMACGET
program files, see the following sections:

- To download the updated files

- To update your LGTWGET.EXE and LMACGET.EXE

MORE INFORMATION
================

This update contains the LGTWGET and LMACGET files, replacements for the LGTWGET
and LMACGET program files included with version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail Connection
for PC and AppleTalk Networks. This update resolves the following problem:

- A message could get stuck in the Mail Connection Outbound Queue. Once this
  message is stuck, the gateway tries to resend this numerous times. This
  results in duplicate messages being transmitted and prevents other messages
  from being sent across the gateway.


  NOTE: To resolve this problem, two files must be updated: the LGTWGET.EXE file
  (included in this update) and the LMACGET.EXE file (included in this update).

To download the updated files
-----------------------------

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:

  DownloadDownload Getupd.exe now
  (http://download.microsoft.com/download/mail35pcnet/Update/3.4.6/DOS/EN-US/Getupd.exe)

Release Date: 08-11-94

  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

To update your LGTWGET.EXE and LMACGET.EXE files
------------------------------------------------

At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER after each line

  " copy &lt;path&gt;\lgtwget.exe &lt;destination&gt; " (without the quotation
  marks)

  " copy &lt;path&gt;\lmacget.exe &lt;destination&gt; " (without the quotation
  marks)

where &lt;path&gt; is the drive and directory where you ran the self- extracting
GETUPD.EXE file and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory where the
LGTWGET.EXE and LMACGET.EXE files currently reside. For example, if you ran the
self-extracting file from the TEST directory on drive D, and your two files are
located in the MAILEXE directory on drive C, type the following commands:

  " copy d:\test\lgtwget.exe c:\mailexe " (without the quotation marks)

  " copy d:\test\lmacget.exe c:\mailexe " (without the quotation marks)

NOTE: The LGTWGET.EXE and LMACGET.EXE files typically reside on the postoffice
server in the Mail executables directory.
