-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- The Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC), used with:
   - Microsoft Visual C++ for Windows, 16-bit edition, versions 1.5, 1.51, 1.52 
   - Microsoft Visual C++, 32-bit Editions, versions 2.0, 2.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Creating or activating embedded or linked OLE objects-based files saved with the
MFC server sample "Scribble" fails in unexpected ways. Two common scenarios
are:

- When you attempt to insert an object into an OLE container using the Create
  from File option, instead of creating a new Scribble Document object and
  inplace activating it, the Packager is invoked and a package is created.
  Nothing appears to happen when you try to activate the package.

- While a Scribble Document is open in the Scribble application, you copy the
  contents to the clipboard, and attempt to paste link from an OLE container.
  The link is created and the container document's image of the link displays
  correctly. But after the container document is saved and both the container
  and Scribble applications are shut down, when you reopen the saved document,
  the container is unable to update or activate the link to the Scribble
  Document.

CAUSE
=====

The .SCR file extension used by Scribble is associated with another file type,
typically screen saver applications.

RESOLUTION
==========

Change the file extension used by Scribble Documents to something that is not
already associated with a file type, for example .SCB. After changing the file
extension, you will need to run Scribble once in standalone mode so it can
update the system registry.

The file extension can be changed by editing the string resource IDR_SCRIBTYPE in
the Scribble application. Initially the string value is:

     \nScrib\nScrib\nScrib Files (*.scr)\n.SCR\nScribble.Document.1\n
        Scrib Document\nSCRI\nscri Files

To change the file extension to .SCB, edit the string value to look like this:

     \nScrib\nScrib\nScrib Files (*.scb)\n.SCB\nScribble.Document.1\n
        Scrib Document\nSCRI\nscri Files

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This bug was corrected in Microsoft Visual C++,
32-bit edition, version 4.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

MFC Applications can update the file associations maintained in the system
registry by calling CWinApp::RegisterShellFileTypes(). However,
RegisterShellFileTypes() does not replace an existing association. Thus when an
association already exists for the .SCR file extension, nothing is added to the
registry to indicate that Scribble should be used to create or edit these
files.

This situation is most likely to occur on Windows 95, as .SCR files are
associated with Screen Saver applications when Windows 95 is installed.
