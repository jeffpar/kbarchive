The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Flight Simulator for MS-DOS, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to run the Setup program from Flight Simulator, version 5.0 on
a computer using a 486 DX/4 processor or an Intel overdrive 63MHz Pentium
processor (part number PODP5V63), you may receive the following error message:

  FATAL error has occurred! Filename: FORN-000.FRN ERROR CODE: 8027

This issue does not occur in Flight Simulator, version 5.1.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, download and install the self-extracting Overdrv.exe
file.

NOTE: Do not install the Overdrv.exe file unless you experience this issue. The
Overdrv.exe file is designed to run only on versions 5.0 and 5.0a of Microsoft
Flight Simulator. This file contains beta drivers designed for use only on
computers based on Intel Pentium or DX/4 overdrive processors. These drivers may
not function correctly on all Intel Pentium- or DX/4 Overdrive-based computers.
If you install the Overdrv.exe file on a computer based on a different processor
or a computer running Microsoft Flight Simulator 5.1, Flight Simulator may not
function properly.

Obtaining the Overdrv.exe File

The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:
