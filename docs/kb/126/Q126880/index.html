SUMMARY
=======

The BS95TBLS.TXT file contains troubleshooting information for Baseball Daily.
The following is the contents of the BS95TBLS.TXT file included with Microsoft
Complete Baseball for Windows, 1995 edition.

==============================================
MICROSOFT COMPLETE BASEBALL'S BASEBALL DAILY
==============================================

This file contains troubleshooting information about Baseball Daily
not included in the User's Guide.

To read this file on-screen, use the Page Down and Page Up keys.  You
can also print the file by opening this file in any Windows word
processing program and choosing the Print command from the File menu.

This file contains important information on the following topics:

1) MODEM INITIALIZATION STRINGS

2) SPECIFIC MODEM INFORMATION

3) COPYING FROM BASEBALL DAILY

4) CHANGING YOUR PHONE PREFIX

5) DISPLAY PROBLEMS

6) GENERAL PROBLEMS

7) BILLING AND PRODUCT SUPPORT INFORMATION

=================================================================
1. MODEM INITIALIZATION STRINGS
=================================================================

Baseball Daily registration uses an initialization string when
setting up your modem for Baseball Daily service. Most modems can
accept the standard, Hayes-compatible, string that Baseball Daily
provides for you automatically.  However, some modems require a
specific string that you must enter manually.

When registering for Baseball Daily, first try using the
Hayes-compatible string provided by Complete Baseball.
If you experience connectivity problems, try the following:

1. Return to the Complete Baseball Contents screen and click the
Daily button to begin the registration process again. Fill out all
the information as before until you reach the Modem Settings dialog.

2. In the Modem Settings dialog, click Other.  In the edit field
under the Other radio button, enter the following:

AT&amp;FQOV1EOX4SO=O

3. When you're done, click OK and complete the remaining registration
information.

If you continue to experience connectivity problems, call (800)
638-8730 for Baseball Daily on-line service product support.

=================================================================
2. SPECIFIC MODEM INFORMATION
=================================================================

For information regarding your particular modem, you can call the
product support phone number listed in your modem's documentation.

=================================================================
3. COPYING FROM BASEBALL DAILY
=================================================================

To copy information from a Baseball Daily screen, press Ctrl+C.  The
information on the active screen is copied to the Windows clipboard.
You can now copy this information into any word processing or
spreadsheet application by switching to that application and choosing
the application's Copy command.

=================================================================
4. CHANGING YOUR PHONE PREFIX
=================================================================

If your phone uses a different prefix from the one Baseball Daily
registration offers, you can set your own phone prefix in the
[online] section of your mssports.ini file.  To set your own phone
prefix:

1. Exit Complete Baseball and Baseball Daily if you are currently
viewing them.

2. In your Windows directory, open your mssports.ini file.

3. Under the [on-line] section, add the following:

       PhonePrefix=&lt;your phone prefix&gt;

4. Choose Save from the File menu.

5. Run Complete Baseball and try downloading an issue of Baseball Daily
again
.

=================================================================
5. DISPLAY PROBLEMS
=================================================================

-------------------
8514/a AND SUPER VGA LARGE FONT VIDEO DRIVERS
-------------------

If you are using either the 8514/a or Super VGA, 256 color, Large
Font driver and a 1024 x 768 resolution, some statistics in Baseball
Daily may appear clipped or will overlap each other.  Switching to
the Small Font version of either driver will fix this problem.

=================================================================
6. GENERAL PROBLEMS
=================================================================

---------------------
CORRUPT BASEBALL DAILY FILE
---------------------

If you receive the following error message while attempting to view a
Baseball Daily file you've already downloaded, your Baseball Daily
file may be corrupt:

"Multimedia Viewer
This file is not a Viewer file and cannot be opened in this application."

To download another issue of the current day's Daily, first, in File
Manager, switch to the \DAILY subdirectory of your \BASEBALL
directory and delete the Baseball Daily file bearing the current
day's date.  For example, if today's date is 7\8\94, you would delete
the file named 19940708.MVB.  You can now download the current day's
file again by choosing the Daily button on the Complete Baseball
Contents screen.

----------------------
VIEWING PREVIOUS ISSUES
----------------------

To view a previous issue of Baseball Daily:

1. Choose the Daily button on the Complete Baseball Contents screen.

2. In the Microsoft Baseball Daily dialog box, choose the View Old
Issue button.

3. In the File Name list box, select the name of the file that
corresponds with the date of the issue you want to view.  For
example, if you want to view an issue from June 15, 1994, choose the
file named 19940615.MVB.

=================================================================
7. BILLING AND PRODUCT SUPPORT INFORMATION
=================================================================
