-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual Basic Standard Edition for Windows, version 3.0 
- Microsoft Visual Basic Professional Edition for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a top-level menu has its WindowList property set to True and the top- level
menu does not contain any sub-menus, after changing the menu's caption the
top-level menu will no longer display the list of MDI child windows and you will
not receive any click events.

RESOLUTION
==========

In order to work around the problem, make sure the top-level menu item that has
the WindowList property set to True has at least 1 sub-menu item.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the example below, a menu on the MDI form contains nothing but a WindowList.
A command button is placed on the MDI child form with code behind it to change
the caption of the menu containing the WindowList. As long as you do not click
on the command button, the Window menu will display a list the MDI child
windows. Once you click on the command button, the Window menu caption is
changed to "Test" and it no longer keeps track of the MDI child windows and it
no longer receives click events.

NOTE: Issuing the command "Print MDIForm1.mnuwindow.Windowlist" (without the
quotes) from the immediate window will return -1 (True). However, the Window
list is not displayed.

Steps To Recreate The Problem
-----------------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic (ALT, F, N). Form1 is created by default.

2. From the Property Window, set MDIChild equal to True for Form1.

3. Add a Command button (Command1) to Form1 and add the following code to the
  Click event.

        Sub Command1_Click ()
           MDIForm1.mnuWindow.Caption = "Test"
        End Sub

4. From the File menu, select New MDI Form. MDIForm1 is created by default.

5. From the Window menu, choose Menu Design.

6. Create a menu for the MDI Form with the following properties:

  Caption   Name        Indented   WindowList
  -------------------------------------------
  File      mnuFile     No         Unchecked
  New       mnuNew      Once       Unchecked
  Window    mnuWindow   No         Checked

7. Choose Done to exit the Menu Design Window. You now have two top-level menus.

8. Add the following code to the Click event of mnuNew menu on MDIForm1.

        Sub mnuNew_Click ()
          Dim f As New Form1
          f.Show
        End Sub

9. Press F5 to run the program.

10. The Window menu will keep track of all the MDIChild windows as long as you
  do not click Command1 contained in the MDIChild. Once you click on the
  command button, the Window menu's caption has changed to "Test" and it will
  no longer list any of the MDIChild windows and you will not receive any
  click events.
