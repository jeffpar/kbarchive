SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Magic School Bus on a machine that has TabWorks installed on it,
the Microsoft Kids program group and the Magic School Bus icons may not display
on the TabWorks page. In addition, if you create tabs for them, they disappear
when Windows is restarted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem without disabling TabWorks, use the following steps:

1. Remove the MSKIDS directory, including all Kids files and directories.

2. In TabWorks, choose Set Shell from the Options menu.

3. Select Program Manager as the Windows shell. Restart Windows.

4. Install the Microsoft Kids programs from within Program Manager.

5. Start TabWorks. Reset TabWorks as the default shell by choosing Set Shell
  from the Options menu. Restart Windows.

6. In TabWorks, choose Import Program Manager Groups from the File menu, then
  select the Microsoft Kids program group.

After following these steps, you should see icons for the Microsoft Kids program
group and for Magic School Bus in TabWorks.

If the Microsoft Kids program group and Magic School Bus icons are still not
visible, it may be necessary to disable TabWorks permanently. To disable
TabWorks version 1.0, use the following steps:

1. In TabWorks, choose Set Shell from the Options menu, and select Program
  Manager as the Windows shell. Restart Windows.

2. Create new icons for the programs that do not have icons. For more
  information about how to perform this task in Windows, see your Windows
  printed documentation or online help.

3. Restart Windows.

After following these steps, you should see icons for the Microsoft Kids program
group and for Magic School Bus.

Please see the following article(s) in the Microsoft Knowledge Base for more
information about how to re-create program icons:
