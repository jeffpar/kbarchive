-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You cannot remotely browse the Microsoft Windows Network with a Windows NT
version 3.5 or 3.51 Remote Access Service (RAS) client running only the TCP/IP
network protocol.

WORKAROUND
==========

Ensure that the workgroup name or domain name on the RAS client computer is the
same as the domain name of the NT RAS server. Also, you must ensure that one of
the following two conditions is met:

1. You have configured the RAS client to use NetBEUI for the RAS connection,

  or

2. You have installed the Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) on the RAS server
  or another server in the RAS server's domain, and your RAS client registers
  with the WINS server.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Using one of the two workarounds specified above is the only way you can ensure
browsing will take place correctly if your RAS client is configured to use
TCP/IP over the RAS connection. You cannot reliably use File Manager to browse
the RAS server or the remote Microsoft Windows Network by trying either of these
two methods:

1. Configuring the clients' RAS PPP connection to use IPX in addition to TCP/IP.

2. Configuring a valid LMHOSTS file on the RAS client that resolves the server's
  IP address.

Adding IPX to the RAS client's PPP configuration will allow you to browse a
remote NetWare or NetWare-compatible network on the RAS server's LAN, but will
not ensure that a RAS client running TCP/IP will be able to browse a remote
Microsoft Windows network.

Remember that if your RAS server is also the WINS server, you will need to
identify the primary WINS server with the RAS server's own IP address. To make
this setting in Windows NT, open Control Panel, and in the Network Settings
dialog box, use the Configure button for the TCP/IP Protocol.
