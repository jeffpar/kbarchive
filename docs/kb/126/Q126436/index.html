SUMMARY
=======

This article provides answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about
the role of a Windows NT 3.5 server in a domain.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Why use a Server?
-----------------

A server does not have to spend resources processing domain logons. Domain
controllers spend part of their time processing logons and replicating the
security database.

The server allows you to mix and match security; accounts may be created in the
local security database and assigned to local resources. Any of the domain
accounts (and accounts from trusted domains) can be assigned to local resources
if the server is a member of a domain.

A server is easier to move to a different domain than a backup domain controller.
A backup domain controller must be reinstalled in the new domain, but the server
can change its domain membership without reinstalling Windows NT.

What is the Difference Between a Domain Controller (DC) and a Server?
---------------------------------------------------------------------

A server:

- does not get a copy of the domain account database, but does have access to
  it.

- Maintains its own local user account database.

- Does not process domain logons.

- Has the same built-in user groups as a Windows NT Workstation (including
  Power Users).

- Can be configured as a member of a domain or workgroup.

How Are Local Accounts Different From Domain Accounts?
------------------------------------------------------

Local accounts are defined in the local account database. In the User Manager at
the server, they are represented by the user or group name, (for example,
Administrators). Only local groups exist on a server.

Domain accounts are defined on the primary domain controller (PDC) and replicated
to the backup domain controller (BDC). Domain accounts are represented by the
user or group name and qualified by the domain name (for example, DOMAIN1\Domain
Admins). Both local and global groups may be defined in a domain.

An Administrator can work with the local account database (choose Select Domain
from the User Manager for Domains User menu and then select or add the local
machine name).

How Does the Server Validate Users and Rights?
----------------------------------------------

The server maintains a local account database, independent of the domain account
database.

When a server joins a domain, certain domain groups are added to groups in the
server's local account database. For example, the Domain Admins group is added
to the local Administrators group and the Domain Users group is added to the
local Users group.

When a user requests access to a resource on the server, the server checks its
local account database to validate the user. If the server does not have an
entry for the user or group, it makes a request to a DC to validate the user
account. If a DC validates the user, the server gives the user access. If not,
access is denied. The server has a trust relationship with the DC.

The server has access to all of the domain user information; a secure
communication channel is established between the server and the DC.

All domain accounts are available to the server's local Administrators for
assigning permissions to local resources.

Certain Accounts Cannot Administer the Server. Why?
---------------------------------------------------

When you logon to a server, you can either logon to the local machine or logon to
the domain (or any trusted domains). If you logon to the local machine using a
domain account, you are validated only if an identical account exists on in the
server's local account database.

By default, the server is set up so that all members of the Domain Admins group
can administer the server.

You can add additional accounts to the server's local Administrators group. These
accounts can be local accounts, domain accounts, or accounts defined in any
trusted domains.

Certain accounts cannot logon locally. Why?
-------------------------------------------

By default, only the local Administrators group is given the right to logon
locally to the server. Since the Domain Admins group is added to the local
Administrators group by default, Domain Admins may logon locally. You can use
User Manager at the server to assign the Log on locally user right to other
accounts.

How do I Remotely Administer My Server?
---------------------------------------

To remotely administer the server, log onto a remote machine with an account that
is a member of the server's local Administrators group.

Although My Account Has Been Added to the Local Administrators Group, I Still Get
Access Denied Error Messages When I Remotely Administer the

Server. Why?
------------

Your user account may exist in both the server's local account database and the
domain account database. This can cause a credentials conflict. If the account
exists in both places, remove it from the local database and add the domain
account to the server's local Administrators group.

How do I Assign Permissions When There are Trust Relationships?
---------------------------------------------------------------

If you have trusts, you can assign permissions for a server's resources to any of
the users or groups in the trusted domains. None of the trusted domain groups
are automatically added to local groups when the server joins the domain, so
you'll need to set this up yourself.

If you have users in the trusted domains who need to administer the server, add
their accounts to the local Administrators group. You can either add the
individual user account (for example, DOMAIN2\ UserAccount) or add the Domain
Admins group (for example, DOMAIN2\Domain Admins).

How Do I Give a User the Right to Administer the Server and Its

Resources But I Not the Domain?
-------------------------------

If the user should not have access to any domain resources, but should have the
right to administer the server, create the user account in the local account
database of the server but don't create a domain account. The user will need to
select the local machine name and not the domain at logon time.
