The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The User Name Mapping service does not seem to work with any of the Windows
Services for UNIX components such at Client for NFS, Server for NFS, Gateway for
NFS, and other components. All files are still being written by using anonymous
permissions even though you configured User Name Mapping properly.

Additionally, the following event ID message may be logged in the system log if
you are running Server for NFS:

  Event Type: Warning
  Event Source: NfsSvr
  Event ID: 1003
  Description:
  Mapping information could not be obtained from Username mapping. Another
  attempt will be made after 30 minutes.

NOTE: This problem only occurs if User Name Mapping is running on a remote
server; however, if a negative entry (represented by a dash [-]) exists in the
.Maphosts file, this problem does not occur.

CAUSE
=====

The authentication mechanism that is used by the network file system (NFS)
protocol is based on trust relationships between host computers. That is, an NFS
server accepts the user identifiers (UIDs) and group identifiers (GIDs) from a
specific client computer because the server is configured to recognize the
client computer as trustworthy.

User Name Mapping acts as an intermediary between NFS servers and NFS clients on
a network that contains UNIX hosts and Windows-based computers. To maintain the
implicit trust relationship between the NFS client and host computers, you must
control which computers can access User Name Mapping and act as a trusted host
on the NFS network.

To control which computers can access User Name Mapping, edit the .Maphosts file
in the &lt;Windows_Services_for_UNIX_folder&gt;\Mapper folder of the server that
is running User Name Mapping. When you add entries in this file, you can easily
allow or deny any other computer access to User Name Mapping. If the .Maphosts
file is present but not empty, only those computers that are allowed access by
entries that are included in the file can access User Name Mapping. If the
.Maphosts file is present but it does not contain host entries (it contains only
comments, which is the default text), only the computer that is running User
Name Mapping can access User Name Mapping; no other computers can access this
service. If the .Maphosts file is not present, no computers can access User Name
Mapping, including the computer that is running User Name Mapping.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, edit the .Maphosts file in the
&lt;Windows_Services_for_UNIX_folder&gt;\Mapper folder on the User Name Mapping
server.

NOTE: When User Name Mapping matches a computer that is making a request against
the elements in the list, it searches from the top down until it finds a match.
As a result, the order of the entries is important.

To edit the .Maphosts file, add any of the following elements:

- host: Use this element to specify one or more computers that can access User
  Name Mapping. You can specify the host by using an Internet Protocol (IP)
  address (IP version 4) or as a host name that resolves to one or more IP
  addresses.

- host -: Use this element to specify one or more computers that are denied
  access to User Name Mapping. You can specify the host as an IP address (IP
  version 4) or as a host name that resolves to one or more IP addresses. Note
  that you must use at least one blank space between "host" and the dash (-).

- Plus sign (+) : Use only the plus sign (+) to specify that all computers can
  access User Name Mapping unless they are denied access by an earlier entry in
  the list. All of the entries in the list that follow this element are
  ignored.

- Dash (-): Use only the dash (-) to specify that all computers are denied
  access to User Name Mapping unless they are allowed by an earlier entry in
  the list. All of the entries in the list that follow this element are
  ignored.
