-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 2.0 SP3, 2.0 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may see some zero-byte .rpl or .rpt files in the site server's
SMS\Inboxes\Replmgr.box\Incoming folder. The number of zero-byte files increases
over time.

CAUSE
=====

There is a problem with the handling of files between the Systems Management
Server (SMS) Despooler and SMS Replication Manager components. The despooler may
receive "Access denied" (Win32 Error 5) error responses when it tries to move
files to the Replmgr\Incoming folder. The error response occurs because
Replication Manager is still processing the file. This leaves a uniquely named
zero-byte file in the Incoming folder in preparation for the last file move.
Over time, the number of zero-byte files may increase.

==========
