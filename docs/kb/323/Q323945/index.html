The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Zoo Tycoon 
- Microsoft Zoo Tycoon: Dinosaur Digs Expansion Pack 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Microsoft Zoo Tycoon Dinosaur Digs Expansion Pack after you install
third-party content, guests in your game may appear to be attached and stuck to
objects in the zoo.

CAUSE
=====

This problem may occur if one or more Zoo Tycoon and/or Dinosaur Digs files are
damaged after you download and install third-party Zoo Tycoon content.


RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, remove and then reinstall Zoo Tycoon and Dinosaur Digs.
To do so, follow these steps.

NOTE: Because there are several versions of Microsoft Windows, the following
steps may be different on your computer. If they are, see your product
documentation to complete these steps.

Part 1: Remove Zoo Tycoon and Dinosaur Digs
-------------------------------------------

1. Click Start, and then click Control Panel.

2. Click "Add or Remove Programs".

3. In the "Currently installed programs" list, click "Zoo Tycoon - Dinosaur
  Digs", and then click Change/Remove.

4. Click Uninstall, and then click OK.

5. Click OK when you receive the message that Zoo Tycoon - Dinosaur Digs was
  removed.

6. Click Start, and then click Search.

7. In the "All or part of the file name" box, type "zoo tycoon" including the
  quotation marks.

8. In the "Look in" box, click the drive on which Zoo Tycoon is installed, and
  then click Search.

9. In the search results window, right-click the Zoo Tycoon folder, and then
  click Delete.

  When you are prompted, click Yes to confirm the deletion.

Part 2: Restart the Computer by Using a Clean-Boot Procedure
------------------------------------------------------------

Use a clean boot to restart your computer. A clean boot is a way to create a
clean environment. When you start your computer with a clean boot, Microsoft
Windows starts and loads only basic devices and services. For more information
about how to use a clean boot, see the "More Information" section later in this
article.

To restart your computer with a clean boot, follow the steps that are appropriate
to your operating system.

Windows XP:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. Type "msconfig" (without the quotation marks) in the Open box, and then click
  OK.

3. Click the General tab, and then click Selective Startup.

4. Click to clear the following check boxes under Selective Startup.

  Process SYSTEM.INI file
  Process WIN.INI file
  Load Startup Items

5. Click the Services tab, click to select the "Hide All Microsoft Services"
  check box, and then click Disable All.

6. Click OK, and then click Restart to restart the computer.

NOTE: To restore the computer to use a normal startup, click "Normal Startup -
load all device drivers and services" on the General tab in the System
Configuration Utility, click OK, and then click Restart to restart the
computer.

Windows Me:

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. In the Open box, type "msconfig" (without the quotation marks), and then
  click OK.

3. Click the General tab, and then click "Selective startup".

4. Click to clear all of the check boxes under Selective startup.

5. On the Startup tab, click to select the *StateMgr check box, and then click
  OK.

  When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Yes.


6. After the computer restarts, click Start, click Run, type "msconfig" (without
  the quotation marks) in the Open box, and then click OK.

  IMPORTANT: Look closely at the General tab to verify that the check boxes that
  you cleared are still cleared. If you see a selected, unavailable check box
  (it appears dimmed and has a check mark in it), your computer is not truly
  "clean-booted," and you may need assistance from the manufacturer of the
  program that is listed next to the selected, unavailable check box.

NOTE: To restore the computer to use a normal startup, click Normal Startup on
the General tab in the System Configuration Utility, click OK, and then restart
the computer.

Windows 98:

1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to System Tools,
  and then click System Information.

2. On the Tools menu, click System Configuration Utility.

3. Click the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the
  following check boxes:

  Process Config.sys file
  Process Autoexec.bat file
  Process Winstart.bat file (if available)
  Process Win.ini file
  Load Startup group items

4. Click OK, and then restart the computer.

NOTE: To restore the computer to use a normal startup, click Normal Startup on
the General tab in the System Configuration Utility, click OK, and then restart
the computer.

Part 3: Reinstall Zoo Tycoon

     drive letter of the CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive.

  &lt;cd-rom&gt;:\setup.exe

  c. Click OK.

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to install Zoo Tycoon.

Part 4: Reinstall Dinosaur Digs

  CD-ROM drive or DVD-ROM drive.
