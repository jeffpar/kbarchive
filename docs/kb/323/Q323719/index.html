-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows Services for UNIX, versions 2.0, 2.1 OEM Only, 2.2 OEM Only, 2.3 OEM Only, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run an rcp command from a UNIX/Linux client to the Windows Services for
UNIX RSH service, you may receive the following error message:

  Example:
  $ rcp testfile winsvr2k:/
  Option t is not valid.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because of an incompatibility between the UNIX rcp command
and the Windows rcp.exe command. If the destination file is on a remote
computer, the UNIX rcp starts rcp -t on the remote computer and sends the file.
The "-t" option tells the remote rcp to start up in receive mode and wait for
the incoming file. Windows rcp.exe has a different method of transferring files
between computers, so it does not support the "-t" option.

RESOLUTION
==========

The Interix version of rcp supports the "-t" option. To cause that version to be
invoked, you have to use the Interix version of rshd daemon instead of the
Windows Remote Shell service. The Interix rshd calls the Interix rcp, but the
Windows Remote Shell service calls the Windows rcp.exe.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To configure the Interix version of rshd under SFU 3.0:

1. Turn off the Remote Shell Service. To do this, ho one of the following:

   - Microsoft Windows NT 4.0: In Control Panel, double-click Services, and
     then stop the Remote Shell Service and turn it off.

   - Microsoft Windows 2000 or Microsoft Windows XP: In Control Panel,
     double-click Administrative Tools, double-click Services, and then stop
     the Remote Shell Service and turn it off.

2. Start an Interix command shell such as the C or Korn shell.

3. Edit the Etc/Inetd.conf file to turn on the Interix version of rshd by
  removing the number sign (#) from the following line:

  #shell stream tcp nowait NULL /usr/sbin/in.rshd in.rshd -a

4. Restart the computer.

5. After you get inetd running as a daemon by editing Inetd.conf, you have to
  edit the Etc/Hosts.equiv file by using a C or Korn shell, because it replaces
  the %Systemroot%\System32\Drivers\Etc\.rhosts file that is used with the
  Win32 version of RSHSVC. This file will have the same format as the .rhosts
  file. Please note that this file does not support the + + construct and you
  must populate it with the specific hosts and users.
