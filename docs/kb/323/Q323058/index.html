The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 4.0, 4.0 SP1, 4.0 SP2, 4.0 SP3, 4.0 SP4 
- Microsoft Host Integration Server 2000 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you make a configuration change in SNA Manager, and then you click OK to
confirm the change, you may receive the following error message:

  Unable to obtain a write lock on the config file.

NOTE: The error occurs before you try to save the configuration file. Depending
on the symptoms, the error can occur on either the Primary or Backup Host
Integration Server (HIS) or the SNA Server.

Some common causes that prevent you from obtaining a write lock on the
configuration file are:

1. Another user has the Com.cfg file open for write and has not saved the
  changes. (A Com.lok file is in the Config directory of the Primary Host
  Integration Server (HIS) / SNA Server.)

2. The file permission or the share permission (or both) for the Everyone group
  account is not set to full access. This can be further qualified, for
  example, if an account such as Administrator or Administrator equivalent is
  specified instead of the Everyone group account.

3. The user who is logged on is not part of the local Administrator group.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If none of the causes mentioned in the "Summary" section apply, there may be an
issue with file creation and the virus scanning software that is running on the
server(s). The cause of the issue may occur when SNA Manager attempts to create
the Com.c$$ in the COMCFG share on the Primary Host Integration Server (HIS) /
SNA Server. The Com.c$$ file is created when a configuration change is made to
the Com.cfg, and then the user clicks OK to confirm the change in SNA Manager.
You may resolve this issue by disabling virus-scanning software.
