-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may notice that two servers running Exchange Server 5.5 in the same site
cannot exchange e-mail. E-mail is queuing to be sent to the other server but the
e-mail is not sent. These servers have successfully exchanged e-mail in the
past, and no other Exchange Server computer in your site has problems sending
e-mail or receiving e-mail.

One of the servers is running Microsoft Windows NT Server 4.0, Service Pack 6 and
the other is running Microsoft Windows 2000 Server, Service Pack 2.

If you test for network connectivity between the two servers using utilities such
as RPC Ping, Ping, and Net Use, all tests are successful.

You may also find the following events listed in the Application log of the Event
Viewer:

  Event ID: 9322
  Source: MSExchangeMTA Type: Warning
  Description: An interface error has occurred. An MtaBindBack over RPC has
  failed. Locality Table (LTAB) index: 68, NT/MTA error code: 5. Comms error 5,
  Bind error 0, Remote Server Name OTHERSERVER, Protocol String
  ncacn_ip_tcp:your server IP address[3208] [BASE IL INCOMING RPC 39 507] (14)

  -and-

  Event ID: 9318
  Source: MSExchangeMTA
  Type: Warning
  Description: An RPC communications error occurred. Unable to bind over RPC.
  Locality Table (LTAB) index: 70, NT/MTA error code: 5. Comms error 5, Bind
  error 0, Remote Server Name OTHERSERVER [MAIN BASE 1 500 %10] (14)

CAUSE
=====

This issue may be caused by the installation of the Microsoft Windows 2000
Security Rollup Package on the Windows 2000 Server-based computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, remove the Windows 2000 Security Rollup Package from the
Exchange Server computer that is running Windows 2000. To do this, follow these
steps:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

3. Click "Windows 2000 Security Rollup Package", and then click Change/Remove.

4. Click Yes to return to your previous configuration.

5. Click OK to restart your computer.

NOTE: If Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 was installed after the Windows 2000
Security Rollup Package was installed on your computer, you cannot remove the
Windows 2000 Security Rollup Package without first removing Internet Explorer.
You must remove Internet Explorer 6 before you can remove Windows 2000 Security
Rollup Package.
