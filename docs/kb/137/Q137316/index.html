-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Using the SET ALTERNATE command to output to a text file can produce a result
that contains extra spaces on the end of each line.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you don't want to see the information scroll on the screen while the text
file is being created, use this command:

     SET CONSOLE OFF

If you want to see the information scroll on the screen, set the _Screen.Fontname
property to a non-proportional (mono-spaced) font, such as Courier.

By calling the SET CONSOLE OFF or setting the FontName property to a non-
proportional font, you can prevent the extra spaces from appearing in the text
file.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Behavior
---------------------------

The following example uses the Customer table in the Vfp\Samples\Data directory.

1. Create a program containing this code:

     CLOSE ALL
     SET SAFETY OFF
     SET CONSOLE ON
     USE C:\VFP\SAMPLES\DATA\customer.dbf
     SET ALTERNATE TO test
     SET ALTERNATE ON
     GOTO TOP
     DO WHILE !EOF()
        ? ALLTRIM(cust_id)+" "+ALLTRIM(company)+" "+ALLTRIM(contact)
        SKIP
     ENDDO
     SET ALTERNATE OFF
     CLOSE ALTERNATE
     CLOSE DATABASES
     SET SAFETY ON

2. Ensure that the _SCREEN.FontName property is set to Arial (or any other
  proportional font). This can be done using this command:

     _SCREEN.FontName="Arial"

3. Run the program. After running the program, open the Test.txt file and place
  the insertion point to determine that there are extra spaces added to the end
  of each line.

Steps to Avoid Behavior
-----------------------

1. To resolve the problem and display the text file on the screen as it is
  created:

  a. Add the following two lines of code to the top of the program:

        oldfont=_SCREEN.FontName          &amp;&amp; This establishes the name
        _SCREEN.FontName="Courier"        &amp;&amp; of the current font and then
                                          &amp;&amp; sets the font to Courier.

  b. Add the following line of code to the bottom of the program:

        _SCREEN.FontName=oldfont          &amp;&amp; This sets the font back to
                                          &amp;&amp; the original setting.

  c. Run the program, and open the Test.txt file. Note that no extra blanks
     have been added to the end of each line.

2. To resolve the problem without displaying the text file on the screen as it
  is created:

  a. Change the SET CONSOLE ON line in the program to SET CONSOLE OFF.

  b. Run the program. Now you will not see the Test.txt file scroll on the
     screen as it is being created. After the program completes, open the
     "text.txt" file. Note that no extra blanks have been added to the end of
     each line.
