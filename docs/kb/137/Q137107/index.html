SUMMARY
=======

This article contains questions and answers about newsgroups on The Microsoft
Network.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. Q. Can I use a third-party news reader to read Internet newsgroups on The
  Microsoft Network?

  A. No. Currently, The Microsoft Network does not support retrieving or sending
  NetNews messages using the NetNews Transfer Protocol (NNTP) required by
  third-party news readers.

2. Q. Do I automatically have access to all the newsgroups when I join The
  Microsoft Network?

  A. No. If you want to have access to all the newsgroups on The Microsoft
  Network, you need to request full access. To do so, go to Categories\Internet
  Center\Internet Newsgroups\How to Access All Newsgroups.

3. Q. Can I download newsgroup messages to read offline?

  A. There is no offline reader at this time. To save a message to your hard
  disk, click Save As on the File menu while you have that message open.

4. Q. Is there a limit on the size of newsgroup messages?

  A. Messages are limited to 64K to adhere to Internet guidelines.

5. Q. Can I set a custom font for viewing newsgroup messages?

  A. No, custom fonts for newsgroup messages are not available.

6. Q. What is ROT13?

  A. ROT13 is a text scrambling method commonly used on the Internet when
  posting information that people might find offensive. In the Read Message and
  Compose Message windows of a newsgroup folder, the ROT13 Encode/Decode
  command is on the Tools menu.

7. Q. Can I cross-post to newsgroups?

  A. No, The Microsoft Network does not support cross-posting. When you
  cross-post a message, one copy is posted, but multiple included newsgroups
  can see it.

  The alternative is multiple posting, which should generally be avoided. Most
  news readers can detect cross-posted messages, so people see only one copy of
  a message. News readers cannot detect multiple postings, and people see the
  message in every newsgroup you post to.

  Currently on The Microsoft Network, if you need to post something to multiple
  newsgroups, the only way is to do multiple postings. We recommend that you be
  careful about posting the same message to multiple newsgroups.

8. Q. How can I read newsgroups from Internet Explorer?

  A. Type the following line in Internet Explorer

  "news:&lt;name of newsgroup&gt;" (without the quotation marks)

  where &lt;name of newsgroup&gt; is the name of the newsgroup you want to read.
