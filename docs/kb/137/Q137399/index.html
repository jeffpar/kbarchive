IMPORTANT: This article contains information about editing the registry.
Before you edit the registry, make sure you understand how to restore it if
a problem occurs. For information on how to do this, view the "Restoring
the Registry" online Help topic in Regedit.exe or the "Restoring a Registry
Key" online Help topic in Regedt32.exe.

SYMPTOMS
========

When you configure your Windows NT computer to connect to many network print
devices using the DLC protocol, one or both of the following symptoms occur:

- The following event appears in the System Log (as seen in the Event Viewer):

  Event ID: 7022
  Source: Service Control Manager
  Type: Error
  Description: Server service hung on startup.

  -or-

- The Server service stops responding (hangs) in a "start pending" state and
  the Netlogon and Browser services do not start. This error message appears
  when you log in:

  Can not contact the domain controller for this domain

CAUSE
=====

The server service does not initially start due to delays caused by the spooler
service.

The spooler service attempts to connect to all the network printers. Usually, you
encounter this problem only on servers attempting to connect to over 25 network
printers using the DLC protocol. The number of connections required to trigger
this event varies according to hardware and network performance.

This problem can also occur if network connectivity is lost between the print
server and printers even with less than 25 networked printers.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem:

Start the Server service manually and then verify connectivity with your network
printers. If connectivity is not an issue, proceed with the following registry
modifications.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that may
require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot guarantee that
problems resulting from the incorrect use of Registry Editor can be solved. Use
Registry Editor at your own risk.

For information about how to edit the registry, view the "Changing Keys And
Values" online Help topic in Registry Editor (Regedit.exe) or the "Add and
Delete Information in the Registry" and "Edit Registry Data" online Help topics
in Regedt32.exe. Note that you should back up the registry before you edit it.

1. Run Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

  \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Spooler

3. From the Edit menu, select Add Value.

4. Add the following:

  Value Name: DependOnService
  Data Type: REG_MULTI_SZ
  Data: LanmanWorkstation&lt;CR&gt;LanmanServer&lt;CR&gt;LmHosts

  NOTE: &lt;CR&gt; Indicates you should press ENTER on the keyboard


5. From the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE subtree, go to the following key:

  \SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NetLogon

6. Select the DependOnService entry

7. From the Edit menu, select Multi String.

8. Add the necessary services to make your data look like this:

  Value Name: DependOnService
  Data Type: REG_MULTI_SZ
  Data: LanmanServer


9. Click OK and quit Registry Editor.

10. Shut down and restart Windows NT.

Adding these lines holds the spooler service from loading until the
LanmanWorkstation, LanmanServer, and LmHosts services have loaded and holds the
netlogon service from loading until spooler, LanmanWorkstation, LanmanServer,
and LmHosts has loaded.
