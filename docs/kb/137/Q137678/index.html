-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 1.1, 1.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install a Systems Management Server Service Pack onto a
computer running Windows NT that only has the Systems Management Server
Administrator Tools installed (not a site server), the Upgrade command on the
Operations menu is unavailable.

CAUSE
=====

The Setup program for the service pack currently only allows the service pack to
be installed onto computers running Windows NT with a Systems Management Server
Primary Site.

Because there are updates to the Administrator Tool components in both Systems
Management Server 1.1 Service Pack 1 and Systems Management Server 1.2 Service
Pack 1 that affect Helpdesk functionality, you must manually update these
components.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, follow the instructions below corresponding to the
version of Systems Management Server you are using.

Installation Instructions for Systems Management Server 1.1 Service Pack 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. From the expanded copy of Systems Management Server 1.1 Service Pack 1, use
  File Manager to locate the appropriate platform directory for your computer
  running Windows NT (such as X86.BIN, Alpha, or MIPS). Go to the INTNL
  directory.

2. Click the Sightnt.dl_ file and then click Copy on the File menu. In the To
  field, enter the path to the Administrator tool &lt;platform&gt;.bin
  directory (for example, x:\Sms\Site.srv\X86.bin), and the new file name
  Sightnt.dll (so that the complete To field may be: x:\Sms\Site.srv\
  X86.bin\Sightnt.dll). If the File Replace option is set in the Confirmation
  dialog box (found on the Options menu), you will be prompted to replace the
  existing copy of Sightnt.dll. Choose to replace this file.

3. Repeat step 2 above, using the new file name Smsres.dll (so that the complete
  To field may be x:\Sms\Site.srv\X86.bin\Smsres.dll).

The installation is now complete.

Installation Instructions for Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Follow steps 1-3 for the installation instructions for Systems Management
  Server 1.1 Service Pack 1, listed in the previous section.

2. Click the Multprot.dl_ file and then click Copy on the File menu. Type the
  same path to the local Systems Management Server Administrator Tools once
  more, including the platform directory (for example,
  X:\Sms\Site.srv\X86.bin), and the new file name Multprot.dll (so that a
  complete to field may be x:\Sms\Site.srv\X86.bin\Multprot.dll).

3. Repeat step 2 above, using the new file name Sightnt.dl_ (so that the
  complete To field may be x:\Sms\Site.srv\X86.bin\Sightnt.dll).

4. Follow this step if Network Monitor has been installed. From the service
  pack's Smssetup\System32\&lt;platform&gt;.bin directory, click the Rnal.dl_
  file. On the File menu, click Copy and type the path to the Windows NT
  System32 directory, using the new file name, Rnal.dll.

The installation is now complete.

Installation Instructions for Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run Service Pack 2 setup on computers running the Systems Management Server
version 1.2 Administrator Tools. No additional steps are required.

Installation Instructions for Systems Management Server 1.2 Service Pack 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run Service Pack 3 setup on computers running the Systems Management Server
version 1.2 Administrator Tools. No additional steps are required.
