The information in this article applies to:

SUMMARY
=======

When you dial a long distance number using a 32-bit communications program in
Windows 95, the number 1 is automatically dialed before the area code of the
number to be dialed. Dialing 1 first for a long distance call is appropriate for
most phone systems, but some systems require you to dial a number other than 1.

This article describes how to configure Windows 95 to dial a number other than 1
to begin a long distance call.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To configure Windows 95 to dial a number other than one to begin a long distance
call, follow these steps:

1. In Control Panel, double-click the Modems icon.

2. Click Dialing Properties.

3. Click New, type a name for the new location in the dialog box that appears,
  and then click OK.

4. Click the Dial Using Calling Card check box to select it, and then click New
  in the dialog box that appears.

5. Type a name for the new calling card in the dialog box that appears, click
  OK, and then click Advanced.

6. Type "G" (without the quotation marks) in the Calls Within The Same Area Code
  box.

7. Type "&lt;n&gt;FG" (without the quotation marks) in the Long Distance Calls
  box, where &lt;n&gt; is the number you want to use in place of 1. For
  example, if you want to use 8 in place of 1, type "8FG" in the Long Distance
  Calls box.

8. Type "&lt;n&gt;1EFG" (without the quotation marks) in the International Calls
  box, where &lt;n&gt; is the number you want to use in place of 1. For
  example, if you want to use 8 in place of 1, type "81EFG" in the
  International Calls box.

9. Click Close, and then click OK.

When you want to dial a long distance number using a communications program,
configure the program to use this new location.

NOTE: "G" inserts the telephone number. "F" inserts the area code. "E" inserts
the country code.

Note that this method works only with 32-bit communications programs that support
the Telephony Application Programming Interface (TAPI). You cannot use this
method if you already use a calling card to dial long distance. When you choose
a calling card in the Change Calling Card dialog box, the advanced settings are
set automatically and cannot be changed.

Another method that you can use for a single HyperTerminal or Dial-Up Networking
connection, or for The Microsoft Network, is to change the area code of the
number to be dialed to match your own area code, and then enter the entire
10-digit number you want to dial in the Phone Number box.

For example, if your local area code is 555, enter 555 in the Area Code box and a
phone number such as "8 123 456-7890" (without the quotation marks) in the Phone
Number box. Windows 95 dials this phone number exactly as it appears in the
Phone Number box. When you use this method, dialing options such as call waiting
or outside line access numbers are used.
