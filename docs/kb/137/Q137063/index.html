The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft World of Flight for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following article is a copy of the Trouble.txt file contained in the root
directory of the World of Flight CD.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Trouble.txt File
----------------

Having problems running Microsoft World of Flight?  Read the text
below. If you don't find the information you need here, check the
README file on the World of Flight CD-ROM.

RUNNING IN LOW MEMORY OR RUNNING SLOWLY
=======================================

Microsoft World of Flight uses your computer's system memory to run.
You need a minimum of 8MB of Random Access Memory (RAM) to use World
of Flight. To determine how much total memory your computer has, go to
a MS-DOS command prompt, type "mem" and press ENTER. If you do not
have at least 8MB (8,192KB) of total memory, you may not be able to
run World of Flight until you add more memory.

Microsoft World of Flight needs a minimum of 5MB (5,120KB) of free
memory in Windows for best movie performance. To check the amount of
free memory Windows has available in Windows 3.1 and Windows NT, start
Windows, and from the Program Manager pull down the "Help" menu and
choose "About Program Manager."

If you find that Microsoft World of Flight runs slowly, if you are
unable to play the videos, or if you encounter out-of-memory errors,
the program probably doesn't have enough memory to run efficiently.
Consider doing the following to improve your computer's performance:

-  Close all unnecessary applications.

- In Windows 3.1, make sure you have a permanent Windows swap file on
  your hard disk. A swap file of greater than 4MB (4,096KB) is
  recommended. See your Windows documentation for more information.

- Defragment ("clean up") your hard disk by running a defragmentation
  program such as DEFRAG, which comes with MS-DOS version 6 or
  higher. A disk defragmenter is also included in Windows 95.

- If you are using more than 256 colors in your monitor display, you
  may want to lower your video colors to 256. For instructions on how
  to change your Windows display, consult your Windows documentation.

CD-ROM PROBLEMS
===============

NOTE: Do not remove the Microsoft World of Flight compact disc from
your CD-ROM drive while World of Flight is running!

If the Microsoft World of Flight program cannot find the data files
that it needs from the World of Flight compact disc, check the
following:

- Make sure the World of Flight compact disc is correctly inserted
  into the CD-ROM drive.

- Make sure that the World of Flight program is looking for the
  compact disc on the correct drive.  Check to see if the drive
  letter for your CD-ROM drive has changed. In Windows 3.1, you can
  use the Windows File Manager to determine which drive letter is
  assigned to the CD-ROM drive.  The Select Drive command in the Disk
  menu will say "CD-ROM" next to the CD-ROM drive letter. In Windows
  95 or later, double-click the My Computer icon to determine which
  drive letter is associated with the CD-ROM drive.

- If you have an external CD-ROM drive, make sure that the drive is
  connected to your computer, plugged in, and turned on. If you still
  encounter problems after checking the points above, check the
  documentation that came with your CD-ROM drive or contact the
  company that supplied the drive.

- Make sure that your CD-ROM drive is MPC-compatible. MPC-compatible
  drives meet the following criteria:

     1. An average seek time of less than one second;

     2. A transfer rate of 150KB per second while using less than 40%
     of the CPU bandwidth.

  Check the documentation that came with your CD-ROM drive to make
  sure it meets these requirements. A CD-ROM drive that does not meet
  the MPC specifications will exhibit slow performance,  audio blips,
  or interruptions when sound is played.

PRINTING AND COPYING
====================

The screens in Microsoft World of Flight are large color pictures.
Depending on the type of printer you have, printing a picture of the
screen may take several minutes.  Also, screen resolution and printer
resolution are often not the same, so the resulting printout may not
match the quality you see on the screen.

You should be able to print grayscale images from Microsoft World of
Flight. If you have a black-and-white laser printer, you might need to
upgrade your printer driver. Call the dealer from whom you bought the
printer or the printer manufacturer. It is also possible to print
World of Flight screens in color on a color printer.

Some dot-matrix printers may not print pictures properly with the "Low
/ Faster" quality setting in the Print Dialog. On these printers
change the quality setting in the Print Dialog to "High / Slower."

You cannot print a frame from a video window. If you attempt to print
while playing a video, you will get a printout of the background
screen.

Because the pictures can be quite large, you may have difficulty
copying or printing in low-memory conditions. In this case, close all
other unnecessary running applications and try again.

If you copy a picture from Microsoft World of Flight, and paste it
into another Windows application, you may encounter palette problems
(the picture will have incorrect colors), because some Windows
applications (like Write and Paintbrush) don't support full-color
palette control. To get a true color copy, paste into an application
that supports color control, such as Paint in Windows 95, or Microsoft
Word for Windows.

Hewlett-Packard DeskJet Printers
--------------------------------

You may get poor results when printing to certain Hewlett-Packard
DeskJet printers. The problem can occur with Hewlett-Packard DeskJet
drivers version 4.0, 4.1 and 5.0. The affected printers include: the
DeskJet 500, 500c, 520, 540, 550, 550c, and 560c printers. Either
obtain the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet printer driver version 6.1d from
Hewlett-Packard or do not use the DeskJet Automatic printing mode. To
change the DeskJet printing mode, see the documentation that came with
your printer.

DEMONSTRATION AND MUSEUM MODE
=============================

Microsoft World of Flight has a demonstration mode for use in stores,
and a museum mode. Both begin an automatic random "slide show" of the
World of Flight pages if you haven't used the program for a specified
number of minutes. Museum mode has special features for standalone
operation.

You can select either of these modes by pressing Ctrl+Alt+D after
starting Microsoft World of Flight.

VIDEO DISPLAY PROBLEMS
======================

Microsoft World of Flight runs in 256-color (or higher) screen mode.
Microsoft World of Flight will not run in less than 256-color mode. If
your computer is running in 16-color mode, and the video card will
support 256 colors, you should switch to 256-color mode. In Windows
3.1, run the Windows Setup program to change the video driver. In
Windows 95, you can change the Settings by opening the Control Panel
and then the Display dialog box. For more information on changing
video drivers, check your Windows documentation.

If you experience display problems, try setting your display
resolution to 640x480. See your Windows documentation or the
documentation that came with your video driver for information about
changing the display resolution.

If you find after installing Microsoft World of Flight that Windows
will not start, try reinstalling your original video driver, or use
the SVGA driver that ships on the Microsoft World of Flight CD in the
data\zdrivers directory. If Windows still does not start or the
display or videos in Microsoft World of Flight are distorted, add the
following line to the [drawdib] section of the WIN.INI file: dva=0

Specific Video Driver Issues on Windows 3.1
-------------------------------------------

S3 Drivers: If you have a computer with an S3 video card, and are
experiencing video display problems, you should install the latest
driver available (currently version 2.41). This driver is included on
the Microsoft World of Flight CD in the data\zdrivers directory. For
details on installing this driver, see your Windows documentation. The
2.41 and 1.32 S3 drivers are designed only to work with the 86C801/805
chip set.

Generic S3 drivers may not be fully compatible with other applications
or your PC Configuration. S3 drivers will not be supported by
Microsoft or by S3, Inc.

Microsoft Super VGA drivers: If you are not using an S3 video card,
and are experiencing video display problems, you should install the
latest driver from your video card manufacturer, or install the
Microsoft Super VGA driver. The SVGA driver is included on the
Microsoft World of Flight CD in the data\zdrivers directory. For
details on installing this driver, see your Windows documentation.

ATI Problems: Microsoft World of Flight is incompatible with some
features of video cards such as the Mach32 chip set running the ATI
drivers. For World of Flight to run on the ATI driver, the "256 color
palette" control in the "Advanced features" of the "ATI Control Panel"
needs to be set to ON. For more information, see the documentation for
your video card.

Microsoft World of Flight Images Appear in Black and White
----------------------------------------------------------

Some color video cards display Microsoft World of Flight images in
black and white. This problem can be solved by updating your color
video driver. Contact your video card manufacturer for these updated
Windows video drivers.

Microsoft World of Flight Videos are Only Partially Visible
-----------------------------------------------------------

In Windows 3.1 or Windows NT, if you only see a portion of the video
image when it is playing, check to see if you have the "Zoom by 2"
setting selected on the Microsoft Video for Windows driver. You can
check this setting using the Windows Control Panel.  Open the Drivers
dialog box, click on "[MCI] Microsoft Video for Windows," click Setup,
and turn off "Zoom by 2" if it is on.

AUDIO PROBLEMS
==============

Audio problems can have many causes. Other applications that play
sounds may interrupt sounds in Microsoft World of Flight, because your
computer cannot play two sounds simultaneously. This is generally a
temporary clash that will resolve itself. However, a few applications
that play sounds, such as some screen savers, may remove audio
capability from all other Windows applications. If you suspect you
have such an application, deactivate it or do not run it while running
World of Flight.

Sounds Play, But Not Very Well
------------------------------

Sounds that are distorted or "fuzzy" have several possible causes. The
most likely one is simply that your speakers are not of high quality.
Low frequency sounds may not reproduce well on some equipment.

It is also possible that the software settings on your sound board are
causing distortion. For example, if the sound card volume or "WAVE
file input" is set to near its maximum, it will produce amplification
distortion, just as it would on a stereo system. To find out how to
change your sound board settings, check the documentation that came
with your sound board.

Your CD-ROM drive should be MPC-compatible. MPC-compatible drives meet
the following criteria:

1. An average seek time of less than one second;

2. A transfer rate of 150KB per second while using less than 40% of
  the CPU bandwidth.

Check the documentation that came with your CD-ROM drive to make sure
it meets these requirements. An incompatible CD-ROM drive may work;
however, it may produce low-quality audio or cause the sound to be
interrupted while playing.

Sounds Don't Play At All
------------------------

If you don't hear any sounds, make sure that the volume is set to an
audible level.

If the volume is set to an audible level and you still hear no sounds,
something may be wrong with your sound board setup. Check to see that
the drivers are installed correctly and, if necessary, reinstall them.
To determine if the sound drivers are installed in Windows 3.1, check
the Drivers section of the Windows Control Panel. In Windows 95, check
the System section of the Windows Control Panel. For more information
on installing your sound drivers, refer to the documentation that came
with your sound card. If you have any problems, contact your sound
board manufacturer for assistance.

Please note that Microsoft World of Flight requires an MPC-compatible
sound board and is not intended to run with drivers which use the PC
speaker, such as the unsupported "PC Speaker" driver. Such a driver
will in most cases not play any sounds, and if the driver setup option
"Enable Interrupts" is not checked, the system may lock up. If you
have both a sound board and the PC Speaker driver installed, it is
recommended that you remove the PC Speaker driver.

Media Vision Cards
------------------

A small number of Media Vision sound card drivers (Pro Audio -
Spectrum cards) may have problems with sound in Microsoft World of
Flight. If you have a Media Vision card and do not hear sounds or are
having fuzzy, skipping, or other sound problems, you might require
updated drivers. You might try changing your DMA setting on the sound
card to DMA 7. See your Windows documentation or your Media Vision
documentation for information on configuring your sound card.
