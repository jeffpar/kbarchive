SYMPTOMS
========

The General tab in Mouse properties may indicate that a PS/2-style mouse is
installed, even though you are using a serial mouse.

When this occurs, the PS/2 mouse port is displayed with an exclamation point in a
yellow circle in Device Manager.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if your computer has a PS/2 mouse port, but you are
using a mouse connected to a serial port. The PS/2 mouse port is the first mouse
port displayed in Device Manager, so the PS/2 mouse is displayed as the
installed device in Mouse properties.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correctly configure the mouse settings, follow these steps:

1. Disable the PS/2 mouse port in your computer's CMOS settings. For information
  about how to do so, please consult your computer's documentation or
  manufacturer.

  NOTES:

   - This may not work if your computer is a Plug and Play system, as the PS/2
     mouse port will be redetected and reenabled the next time you start
     Windows 95.

   - On some older computers, disabling the PS/2 mouse port may not be an
     option in the CMOS settings. Instead, there may be a jumper on the
     motherboard to disable the port. Consult the computer's documentation or
     manufacturer if you are not sure how to disable the port.

2. In Control Panel, double-click the System icon.

3. On the Device Manager tab, click Standard PS/2 Port Mouse, and then click
  Properties.

4. Click the Original Configuration (Current) check box to clear it, and then
  click OK.

If you decide later to use the PS/2 mouse port, reenable the port in your
computer's CMOS settings, and then run the Add New Hardware Wizard to redetect
it in Windows 95.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Some Plug and Play motherboards may actually have pinholes for a PS/2 mouse port
but have no PS/2 mouse port installed. In some cases, there may be no CMOS
settings or jumpers to disable the PS/2 mouse port. If this is the case,
following steps 2-4 above may resolve the situation.
