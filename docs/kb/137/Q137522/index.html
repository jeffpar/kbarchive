-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft File and Print Services for NetWare version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

An attempt to delete one or more directories on an FPNW server is unsuccessful.
The delete command completes without error, but the directory being deleted
remains until such time as another client, which happens to have an open search
handle to the directory, either logs off or deletes its drive mapping to the
shared resource.

CAUSE
=====

When a NetWare client searches a directory, either to locate a specific file or
to list files in the directory, a search handle must be created on the server.
Since NetWare clients do not notify the server when they are done with the
handle, the server keeps the handle open (in order to satisfy any later
directory lookup operations that the client may want to submit).

This can cause a problem when a NetWare client gets a DIR listing of a directory
on an FPNW server, and another client -- or someone at the server console --
then attempts to delete the same directory.

If the FPNW server keeps the search open too long, clients can't delete the
directory. If the FPNW server closes the search too soon, clients are unable to
read the entire contents of the directory. There are some situations, such as
when the client that issued the DIR logs off, in which the FPNW server knows it
may delete the search handle safely. Note too, that if a particular client is
the only one with an open search handle, it may also delete the directory since,
once again, FPNW knows that it is safe to do so in this situation.

WORKAROUND
==========

Directories that cannot be deleted for the reason discussed above will be
deleted successfully once the client(s) with open search handles have logged off
and/or deleted their mapping to the shared resource. A partial fix for this
problem is also available in the form of an updated copy of Fpnwsrv.sys. This
update allows FPNW to close directory search handles in some situations where it
could not before. Specifically, if a NetWare client comes in and does a
FileSearchInit and then sends FileSearchContinue for both directory and
nondirectory files and enumerates them all, then the search will be closed out.

So if the client does:

  DIR \FOLDER1\FOLDER2

then FPNW won't keep the search handle open and the directory can be deleted. But
if the client does:

  DIR \FOLDER1\FOLDER2\TEST.TXT

then FPNW probably will keep the search handle open, depending on what the client
does.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in File and Print Services for
NetWare version 3.51. This problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51
U.S. Service Pack. For information on obtaining the Service Pack, query on the
