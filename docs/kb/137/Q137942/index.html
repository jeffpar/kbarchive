-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you perform a backup operation in Microsoft Backup, it may take longer than
you expect. This poor performance may or may not be accompanied by poor hard
disk performance while you perform other tasks in Windows 95.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can be caused by any of the following factors:

- Lack of available memory.

- Hard disks that are using MS-DOS Compatibility mode. This mode may be in use
  for either the file system or for virtual memory.

- Poor hard disk performance due to other factors, such as a less than optimal
  hard disk and controller configuration, or the use of disk compression on a
  computer with a relatively slow processor.

- File fragmentation on the hard disk.

- Unusable sectors on the backup tape.


RESOLUTION
==========

Lack of Available Memory
------------------------

A lack of available memory is typically caused by having too many programs open
at the same time, or by not having enough physical RAM installed in the
computer. To resolve this problem, close all running programs before starting
the backup process. If doing so does not improve performance, remove all
programs from the Startup folder and from the "load=" and "run=" lines in the
Win.ini file, and restart Windows 95. If performance is still poor, you may need
to add more physical RAM to your computer to improve performance.

Hard Disks Using MS-DOS Compatibility Mode
------------------------------------------

If the Performance tab in System properties shows that one or more of the hard
disks in your computer is using MS-DOS Compatibility mode, resolving this
problem should improve performance in Backup. For more information about
troubleshooting MS-DOS Compatibility mode, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q130179 Troubleshooting MS-DOS Compatibility Mode on Hard Disks

To access the Performance tab, double-click the System icon in Control Panel, and
then click the Performance tab.

Poor Hard Disk Performance
--------------------------

Even if your hard disks are not using MS-DOS Compatibility mode, the performance
of Backup may be affected by the performance of your hard disks. If you are
using an IDE hard disk, the performance of the hard disk may be affected by
another device that is connected to the same IDE controller channel. Older hard
disks with slow access speeds, CD-ROM drives, and tape drives all may adversely
affect performance when connected to the same IDE controller channel as your
hard disk. To resolve this problem, move the slower device to a separate IDE
controller, or to the second IDE channel on an EIDE dual-port controller.

If you are using disk compression on a computer with a relatively slow processor,
hard disk performance may not be as good as if you were not using disk
compression. If you are using third-party disk compression software that uses a
real-mode driver to access your compressed drives, you may be able to improve
performance by replacing the real-mode driver with a protected-mode driver. For
information about obtaining such a driver, contact the manufacturer of your
third-party disk compression software.

File Fragmentation on Hard Disk
-------------------------------

Badly fragmented hard disks can affect the performance of Backup, as well as the
performance of other tasks in Windows 95. To resolve this problem, run Disk
Defragmenter to defragment your hard disks. To run Disk Defragmenter, click the
Start button, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to System Tools,
and then click Disk Defragmenter.

Unusable Sectors on Backup Tape
-------------------------------

Backup can detect and avoid unusable sectors on a tape, but the process that it
uses to do so can be time consuming. If you suspect that performance problems in
Backup are caused by unusable sectors on a tape, try using a new tape, or a tape
that you know does not contain unusable sectors.
