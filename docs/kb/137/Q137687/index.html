-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft PowerPoint for Windows 95, version 7.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use Media Player to play sounds, CD-audio clips, or MIDI files during a
slide show, a gray box always displays in place of the Media Player icon, even
if the icon is covered by another object.

CAUSE
=====

You can use Media Player to play sounds across multiple slides. Because there is
no actual image to display when Media Player plays any kind of audio clip, a
gray box appears in place of the Media Player icon. Media Player must be able to
display movies, so it always comes to the top during a slide show, regardless of
what objects are placed on top of it and regardless of which Media Player
options are chosen.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior and remove the gray box from the screen so that it
does not disrupt the appearance of the presentation, use the appropriate method
for your situation:

Method 1: Insert the sound as a Clip Gallery object
---------------------------------------------------

1. On the Insert menu, point to Movies And Sounds, and then click Sound From
  Gallery.

2. If the sound you want is not listed in Clip Gallery, click Import Clips.
  Follow the instructions on your screen to add your sound.

3. Click the icon that represents your sound and then click Insert.

Method 2: Use Sound Recorder Rather than Media Clip
---------------------------------------------------

1. On the Insert menu, click Sound.

2. Select the sound file you want to use.

3. Attach sound files to transitions where appropriate.

Method 3: Use Media Player
--------------------------

Hold down the ALT key and drag the Media Player icon entirely off the slide and
set up Media Player to play automatically.
