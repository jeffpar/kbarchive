SUMMARY
=======

Winscl.exe is a command line administrative tool for managing Windows Internet
Name Service (WINS) servers. This tool is available in the Windows NT 3.51 and
4.0 Resource Kits. This article includes several tips for using Winscl.exe.

MORE INFORMATION
================

- The WINS Server must be running to modify the WINS database with Winscl.exe.

- WINSCL does not run under Windows NT 3.5.

- You must have administrative permission to administer a WINS database. If you
  run WINSCL from an untrusted domain, you must have a user name and password
  that matches an administrative account on that domain.

- WINSCL is case sensitive. The commands must be entered in upper-case, and
  NetBIOS names must match those that appear in the WINS database exactly.

- Many commands give you a choice to enter 1 to select an option. You can enter
  0 to choose the other option. For example, when you first start WINSCL you
  see:

  TCP/IP or named pipe. Enter 1 for TCP/IP --

  You can enter 0 to select named pipe.

- WINSCL may indicate that a command was successful, such as when you add or
  delete a WINS entry. You should Refresh and view the WINS database and verify
  that the command was carried out successfully. There is no indication when a
  command fails.

- When removing WINS database entries, you must individually remove all the
  names that a computer may register. For example, a typical Windows client
  computer named "CHARLIE" would register three names, CHARLIE[00],
  CHARLIE[20], and CHARLIE[03]. To totally remove CHARLIE from the database,
  you must specifically remove all three names. The sixteenth character in the
  [] brackets is what differentiates the three names.

To use WINSCL to delete dynamic WINS entries, use the following steps:

1. Type the following command and then press Enter.

  WINSCL T

  WINSCL prompts you for the IP address of the server running WINS.

2. Enter the WINS server's IP address and then press Enter.

3. Type the following command and then press Enter.

  DN &lt;ComputerName&gt;

  where ComputerName is the name of the computer you wish to remove.

  WINSCL prompts you to enter 1 to select a 16th character. Enter a 1 and the
  NetBIOS registration that you wish to remove. DO NOT include any backslashes
  ('\\'), enter only the NetBIOS name. Each registration must be removed
  separately.

4. Type the following command and then press Enter.

1

5. Type the following command and then press Enter.

  1B

  WINSCL prompts you for a scope. Enter 0.

6. Type the following command and then press Enter.

0

The entry has been removed from the WINS database. Refresh the WINS manager and
verify the entry has been deleted.

Tools" or Winscl.txt in the Windows NT Resource Kit folder.
