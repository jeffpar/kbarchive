SUMMARY
=======

During the current season, Complete Baseball Guide provides a way to download
previous issues of Baseball Daily you may have missed.

You can also download issues for dates prior to when you registered for Baseball
Daily (back issues).

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: The following steps involve finding and editing .ini files. For more
information about how to accomplish this task in Windows, see your Windows
printed documentation or online help.

To download previous issues of the Baseball Daily, do the following:

1. Change the following line, located in the [BS95OL] section of the
  Mssports.ini file,

        [BS95OL]
        LastDownload=YYYYMMDD.MVB

  (where YYYY=1995, MM=Month, and DD=Day)

  to one day before the issue you would like to download. The file can be edited
  in a text editor such as WordPad or Notepad.

  NOTE: The file Mssports.ini is located in the Windows folder.

  For example, suppose you would like to set the date to August 2, 1995 and
  continue downloading copies up to the current date. The LastDownload= entry
  should look like the following:

        LastDownload=19950802.MVB

2. Move, rename or delete the current days *.mvb file from the Msbs95\Bs95_dly
  folder.

After completing these changes, you can use Baseball Daily to download back
issues.
