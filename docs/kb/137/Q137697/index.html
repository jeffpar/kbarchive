SYMPTOMS
========

If you have a Colorado Trakker tape drive installed in your computer, you may
receive the following message when you start Microsoft Backup:

  The parallel port your tape drive is connected to is configured as an
  ECP, Enhanced, or Bi-Directional port. Using your tape drive with this
  configuration will not work reliably and you will not be able to
  recover data from tapes. To use your tape drive without data loss on
  this port, the port configuration must be changed to NON-ECP mode.

Even if you do not receive this message, you may not be able to back up, compare,
or restore files reliably using Backup. When you try to back up, compare, or
restore files, you may receive any of the following error messages:

- Unable to transfer data properly. Retry the operation.

- Tape header contains unexpected or invalid values. Microsoft Backup
  encountered an error reading this tape. This error may be caused by an
  unformatted or incorrectly formatted tape. Reformat the tape, and then try
  again.

NOTE: You may not receive any error messages when you back up files, but you may
then be unable to compare or restore the files. If you can restore the files,
the data that is restored to your hard disk may be damaged.

CAUSE
=====

The problems described above can occur when you are using a Colorado Trakker
tape drive connected to a parallel port that is in extended capabilities port
(ECP) or enhanced parallel port (EPP) mode. Backup does not function properly
with Colorado Trakker tape drives connected to ECP or EPP ports.

RESOLUTION
==========

Configure the parallel port so that it is not in ECP or EPP mode. For
information about how to configure a parallel port on your computer, please
consult the computer's documentation or manufacturer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Backup may be able to determine when a Colorado Trakker tape drive is connected
to an ECP or EPP port. When it does, it generates the message stated earlier in
this article. However, because of the lack of a standard implementation for ECP
and EPP ports, Backup cannot always detect an ECP or EPP port. When Backup
cannot detect that an ECP or EPP port is being used, the problems described in
this article can occur.
