-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you send a fax from Microsoft Exchange, you may be unable to select a fax
cover page. When this occurs, there are no cover page files listed in the
Compose New Fax Wizard, or in the Default Cover Page section of the properties
for Microsoft Fax.

CAUSE
=====

This problem can occur if the Archive attribute has been removed from the .cpe
files in the Windows folder, or if you have created a cover page in an
unrecognized format, even if the Archive attribute is set correctly.

NOTE: The Archive attribute is often removed by backup programs. If you perform
frequent backups, you may want to create a batch file containing the MS-DOS
ATTRIB command to restore the file's Archive attribute.

RESOLUTION
==========

This problem is resolved by the following updated file for Windows 95:

  COVERPG.EXE version 4.00.962 (2/6/96, 147,456 bytes) and later

To obtain this file, see the "Instructions for Downloading" section below.

Installation
------------

To install the updated file, follow these steps:

1. Download the COVERPG.EXE file from one of the online services listed below to
  an empty folder.

2. In My Computer or Windows Explorer, double-click the COVERPG.EXE file you
  downloaded in step 1.

3. Follow the instructions on the screen.

Manual Restoration of the Archive Attribute
-------------------------------------------

Microsoft recommends you obtain the COVERPG.EXE file to resolve this issue;
however, to manually restore the Archive attribute for the .cpe files, you can
use one of the following methods.

Method 1:

Use Windows Explorer to restore the Archive attribute to the .cpe files. To do
so, follow these steps:

1. Use the right mouse button to click a .cpe file in the Windows folder, and
  then click Properties on the menu that appears.

2. Click the Archive check box to select it, and then click OK.

3. Repeat steps 1-2 for each .cpe file in the Windows folder.

Method 2:

Rename the custom cover pages to something else. This should restore the default
cover pages.

File Installed
--------------

The following file is installed when you install Coverpg.exe:
