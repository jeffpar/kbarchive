-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.2a, 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

When you maintain or troubleshoot a Microsoft Mail for PC Networks postoffice in
a Novell NetWare environment, many Novell utilities can be useful, such as the
following:

   CHKVOL.EXE  - Displays statistics on the current volume.

      FLAG.EXE  - Displays and allows modification to NetWare file
                  attributes.

   MONITOR.NLM  - Views open files and releases locked files (launched
                  from the server console only).

      NDIR.EXE  - Displays the size, date, time, and owner of each file in
                  a NetWare directory.

     PURGE.EXE  - Permanently deletes previously erased files in a
                  NetWare directory.

    RIGHTS.EXE  - Displays a user's access rights in the current
                  directory.

   SALVAGE.EXE  - Restores deleted files that are not yet purged.

    SYSCON.EXE  - For network administration (user accounts, server
                  error log, file server information, etc.).

  USERLIST.EXE  - Displays a list of all users currently logged onto the
                  server.

NOTE: For best results, make sure you are logged onto the Novell server as
SUPERVISOR or equivalent before you run any of the above utilities.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following is detailed information about the utilities listed above:

CHKVOL.EXE
----------

Usage: CHKVOL

Chkvol will report the following information on the current volume:

- Total volume space

- Space in use by files

- Space in use by deleted files

- Space available from deleted files

- Space remaining on volume

- Space available to &lt;currentuser&gt;

Because mail executables do not consider "Space in use by deleted files" as
actual free space, a purge may be needed (see PURGE.EXE below). To determine the
actual amount of free space a mail executable sees, use the following formula:

  (Space Remaining on Volume) minus (Space in Use by Deleted Files) equals
  (Actual Free Space)

This utility is also useful in determining the actual space available to the user
that is currently logged on. This may or may not be less than the Space
Remaining on Volume figure. See the SYSCON section below about volume/disk
restrictions for more information.

FLAG.EXE
--------

Usage: FLAG [path [option | [+|-] attribute(s) ] [SUB]]
Example: FLAG M:\MAILDATA\*.* RW SUB

This will change all file attributes under MAILDATA and subdirectories to
Read/Write. For high-traffic postoffices, you can also add the (S)hareable
attribute to KEY files and GLB files (with the exception of CONTROL.GLB,
TID.GLB, FLAG.GLB, and MASTER.GLB).

MONITOR.NLM
-----------

Usage: (from the file server console only) LOAD MONITOR. This is a menu driven
utility useful for clearing locked files from stranded connections. It also
provides viewing of file open/lock activity, file server resource utilization
stats, connections, and disk information.

NOTE: In order to run this utility from a workstation, RSPX.NLM and REMOTE.NLM
must be loaded on the file server, and Remote Console (RCONSOLE.EXE) must be
launched at the workstation. RCONSOLE provides a direct console connection to
the server so that it is possible to run MONITOR from a desktop machine.

When a workstation running a mail executable crashes, MAILDATA files may be left
open. Use MONITOR to close the files safely, and clear the connection.

1. From the Available Options menu, choose Connection Information.

2. Select the logon ID whose machine has crashed, then press DELETE.

3. Answer Yes to the Clear Connection? prompt.

NDIR.EXE
--------

Usage: NDIR [path] [/option...]
Example: NDIR M:\MAILDATA\*.* /OW LE " " /SUB

Displays all ownerless files under MAILDATA and subdirectories along with the
file date/time stamp and size.

For additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q100511 Assigning Owners to Files in NetWare 2.x and 3.x


PURGE.EXE
---------

Usage: PURGE [filename | wildcard] [/ALL | /A]
Example: PURGE M:\MAILDATA\*.* /ALL

Purges all deleted MAILDATA files from the volume. Because mail executables can
not interpret free space from the space used by deleted files, a periodic purge
may be necessary.

RIGHTS.EXE
----------

Usage: RIGHTS [path]
Example: RIGHTS M:\MAILDATA

Rights can contain any of the following: [SRWCEMFA]

     All | Supervisor | Read | Write | Create | Erase
         | Modify |File scan |Access Control

Displays the current logon ID's effective rights for the MAILDATA directory.

Usually these rights are inherited down into all sub-directories as well, unless
otherwise specified in Trustee Directory Assignments for that user. It is useful
for checking a mail client or a mail message transfer agent's (MTAs) user rights
to MAILDATA.

SALVAGE.EXE
-----------

Usage: SALVAGE
This is a menu driven utility.

SALVAGE is useful for quickly restoring a recently deleted file. To restore a
deleted MAILDATA file, do the following:

1. Run SALVAGE in the same volume where MAILDATA resides.

2. Change the current directory to the MAILDATA directory that contained the
  deleted file.

3. Select to View\Recover Deleted files, then set the view criteria for *.*

4. Search for the filename you wish to restore; highlight it, and press ENTER.

NOTE: If you restore a previous version over an existing file, you will be
prompted to rename the file you are restoring.

SYSCON.EXE
----------

Usage: SYSCON
This is a menu driven utility.

SYSCON (short for SYStem CONfiguration) performs most of the system management
functions. Some of the pertinent options are:

File Server Information:

  Allows the viewing of the NetWare versions, revision numbers and number of
  licenses for any on-line Novell server on the network.

Supervisor Options:

  Contains several functions, including view/edit system AUTOEXEC file (to see
  which modules are being loaded on the server) and view the file server's
  error log.

User Information: Contains all users accounts and associated information, such
as

- Account restrictions (when does the account and/or password expire?).

- Groups Belonged to (default = EVERYONE).

- Other Information (last login date/time, disk space in use).

- Security Equivalencies (either to a group or another user).

- Station Restrictions (limits the user to logging on from only the specified
  MAC address or addresses).

- Time Restrictions (time interval specified for allowed logins).

- Trustee Directory Assignments (access privileges to specified directories).

- Volume/Disk Restrictions (limits the amount of disk space the user can
  actually fill on a volume).

USERLIST.EXE
------------

Usage: USERLIST [fileserver/][name] [/Address | /Object] [Continuous]
Example: USERLIST MAILSRV/ /A

Displays all currently logged on users on the Novell file server MAILSRV, as well
as each node address and login time. You must be currently logged on or attached
to the server you wish to run USERLIST on. If you do not specify a server name,
USERLIST will default to the server you are currently logged on to and running
the USERLIST utility from.
