-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you upgrade from Windows 3.x to Windows 95 on a computer with a Number 9
video card, you may receive any of the following error messages when you try to
play .avi files or run a program that plays .avi files:

- Invalid dynamic link call to a .dll

- Page fault in mmsystem.dll

- This program has called an invalid dll

- Your program is making an invalid dynamic link call to a .dll file

CAUSE
=====

Some Number 9 video card drivers for Windows 3.x add support for DCI functions
that can conflict with the DCI support in Windows 95. When you upgrade to
Windows 95, the previous Number 9 DCI support is not removed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correct this problem, follow these steps:

1. Use any text editor (such as Notepad) to open the System.ini file in the
  Windows folder.

2. In the [Drivers] section of the System.ini file, change the line that reads

  DCI=RFMDCI

  to read:

  ;DCI=RFMDCI

3. In the [Display] section of the file, change the line that reads

  DCI-Support=On

  to read:

  ;DCI-Support=On

4. Save and then close the System.ini file.

5. Shut down Windows 95 and restart your computer.

NOTE: Most Number 9 video cards also change the "DCI=" line in the [Display]
section of the System.ini file. Changing this to read:

  DCI=Display

This solves invalid dynalink problems when you run .avi files.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Number 9 has developed updated video drivers for Windows 95 that include support
for specific features of their cards. These drivers do not correct the problem
described in this article.

The behavior described in this article can also occur with a MIRO 12SD video
card. To resolve this issue, follow the steps in the "Resolution" section, but
in step 2, comment out the line that reads:

  dci=mirodci

The behavior described in this article can also occur with the following video
cards:

- Cirrus Logic 5434 PCI

- Creative Labs 3D Video Blaster

- Diamond Stealth 3D 2000

- Matrox Millennium

- Matrox MGA

- S3 Vision 968

- Siig Aurora 4000 PCI

- STB PowerGraph 64

- Venus 1 MB

To resolve this issue, follow the steps in the "Resolution" section.
