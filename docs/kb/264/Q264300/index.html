-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator: WWII Europe Series, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you play a multiplayer game of Microsoft Combat Flight Simulator, enemy
aircraft appear smaller than they do when you play a single-player mission, a
Campaign, or a Quick Combat mission.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs for the following reasons:

- When you play a single-player mission, a Campaign, or a Quick Combat mission,
  Combat Flight Simulator uses oversized enemy aircraft models to increase the
  visibility of the aircraft.

- When you play a multiplayer game, Combat Flight Simulator uses the regular
  size of the aircraft models for all players in the game.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, decide on a set of oversized aircraft models, and
then require everyone in the game to download and install the same set of models
before you start the game.

The Combat Flight Simulator Web site contains links to third-part Web sites that
contain numerous aircraft and mission add-ons. To locate and download oversized
third-part aircraft models, click one of the Web links on the following
Microsoft Web site:
