-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

In the Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS) Administrator Console, the
Secondary Site Creation Wizard provides the option of transferring source files
to the secondary site server from the primary site server, or of specifying that
the installation source files are on a CD-ROM at the secondary site server. If
the second option is selected, the Setup program searches for installation
source files from a local CD-ROM or a shared network CD-ROM drive.

If source files from the installation CD-ROM are copied to a local hard disk on
the secondary site server, Setup is unable to find them because it looks for the
source files on the CD-ROM drive. If the installation CD-ROM is not inserted in
the CD-ROM drive, Setup does not work.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs because the bootstrap is not configured to examine the
local drive for the SMS installation files.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q288239 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

It is possible to use installation source files on the local hard disk by
sharing the folder where they reside, and then connecting to it as a network
drive by using the net use command. This method allows you to copy the source
files to the local hard disk of the secondary site server so that Setup can find
them there. This method can be useful for a customer whose clients are spread
across a large geographic area with local area network (LAN) and wide area
network (WAN) connections. These clients can load the operating system and all
necessary software on the servers, copy the SMS 2.0 CD-ROM files locally to
various server's hard disks, ship the servers to their destinations, and then
initiate the Create Secondary Site process, directing Setup to search for the
source files locally.

Creating a Secondary Site Using Local Source Files on a Secondary Site Server
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Copy the source files from the SMS 2.0 CD-ROM to a folder on a local drive of
  the secondary site server.

2. Share the folder and connect to it (from the same computer) by using the net
  use command. This action effectively creates a network connection.

3. Initiate the secondary site creation by clicking the "Installation source
  files are on a CD-ROM at secondary site server" option.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0.Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft
products that are listed at the beginning of this article.This problem was
corrected in Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 3 (SP3).

MORE INFORMATION
================

With the hotfix installed, the Bootstrap service will now search CD-ROM drives,
local fixed and removable drives, and network drives for the SMS installation
files.
