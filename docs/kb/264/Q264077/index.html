SYMPTOMS
========

When you run one of the programs that are listed at the beginning of this
article, you may receive the following error message:

  This application is unable to continue running. The problem may be the result
  of low system resources such as memory or disk space. Try closing down other
  applications, increasing the amount of file space on the disk drive that
  contains Windows, or adding more memory.

You may receive this error message when you attempt to perform any of the
following actions:

- Start the program

- Use the Find feature in the program

- Print from the program

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if any of the following conditions are true:

- Hurricane 98 WinGauge is installed on your computer.

- The Microsoft Data Access Components (MDAC) Update installation did not
  complete successfully.

- The video driver for your video adapter is damaged or outdated.

- The printer driver for your printer is damaged or outdated.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following methods in the order in which they are
presented.

Uninstall Hurricane 98 WinGauge
-------------------------------

To uninstall Hurricane 98 WinGauge:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.

3. Click Hurricane 98 WinGauge, and then click Add/Remove.

4. Follow the instructions on the screen to remove Hurricane 98 WinGauge.

If Hurricane 98 WinGauge is not installed on your computer, or if the issue
continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Download and Install MDAC
-------------------------

Follow the steps for the operating system that is installed on your system.

Windows 95:

Install DCOM 95 first, and then follow the steps for Windows 98

Windows 98/Millennium Edition:

1. Connect to the following Microsoft Web site:

  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?ReleaseID=23951

2. Click "Save this program to disk", and then click OK.

3. In the Save in box, click Desktop, and then click Save.

4. Click Close when the copying process is done.

To install the MDAC 2.5 SP1 update:

1. Double-click the Mdac_typ.exe file on the Windows desktop.

2. Follow the instructions on the screen to install the MDAC 2.5 sp1 update.

3. When you receive the prompt to restart the computer, click Yes.

If you encounter problems when you install the MDAC 2.5 sp1 update, restart the
computer in Safe mode, and then repeat this procedure.

Windows 2000:

You need to install the Windows 2000 Service Pack 1. Doing so automatically
installs the MDAC 2.5 SP1 and protects this MDAC release using System File
Protection. This means that you can only remove MDAC 2.5 SP1 from Windows 2000
by uninstalling the Windows 2000 Service Pack 1. You can download SP1 for
Windows 2000 at the following website:
