The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When an administrator selects a machine from within the Systems Management
Server (SMS) Administrator's Console to remotely control, the following message
may appear:

  A Database could not be found with the name supplied.

CAUSE
=====

The Windows Management Repository files may have become corrupted. This can
occur if the Smsprov.mof file is compiled on the site server while SQL and the
repository are on a different machine.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this behavior, remove and recompile the Windows Management
Repository files. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Stop the Windows Management Service.

2. Remove "x:\SMS\bin\i386\smsprov.mof" from:

  HKLM\Software\Microsoft\WBEM\CIMOM\AutoRecoverMOFs

  This line needs to be removed so the MOF is not recompiled when the repository
  is being rebuilt. The Smsprov.mof should not be compiled on the site server
  if the provider is on a separate SQL server.

3. Delete the WBEM repository. To do this, delete all files in:

  \winnt\system32\wbem\repository

4. Restart the Windows Management Service.

If this procedure does not resolve the problem, you may need to reload the latest
Service Pack. To do this, go to Start, Programs, System Management Server, and
then SMS Setup. Next, select Upgrade. Upgrade requires the CD-ROM on your local
drive. If any post-Service Pack hotfixes have been applied, it will be necessary
to reapply those hotfixes again after the upgrade.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Windows Management (such as Microsoft's implementation of the WBEM
specification) is now part of the operating system and other functions may
require it. Systems Management Server 2.0 is simply a delivery mechanism for
Windows Management. Thus, client removal leaves this component intact. It is
also available from Microsoft as part of Windows NT 4.0 SP4, Windows 98, and
Windows 2000.
