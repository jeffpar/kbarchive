The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

During a disaster recovery situation, the public folders in an Exchange Server
organization may be re-homed under the following circumstances:

- The information store is restored to a recovery server.
- The directory service or information store consistency checker is run on the
  recovery server.
- The information store service is stopped on the recovery server.
- The information store database files are copied to the production server and
  the information store service is started.

When the information store service is started on the production server (after the
Pub.edb file is copied from the recovery server), public folder replication
takes place between the production server and the rest of the public folder
servers in the organization. After replication has occurred, all unsecured
public folders in the organization are re-homed to the production server where
the databases are restored.

After the public folders are re-homed, clients may not be able to access the
public folders. Also, unlike other public folder re-homing scenarios, in this
case, no administrators in any site can administer the re-homed public folders.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The recovery server, on which the information store was restored, did not have a
copy of the folder from the production server. Therefore, when you run the
directory service or information store checker on this computer, the directory
service or information store checker does not have information about all of the
other servers and mailboxes in the organization. As a result, the public folders
are re-homed to the recovery server. In addition to re-homing the public
folders, because a directory object for the public folders is not found in the
folder on the recovery server, a new directory object is created for each
re-homed public folder.

The following events are logged on the recovery server on which you run the
directory service or information store consistency checker:

  The public folder Americas\Texas\Las Colinas in the directory service was

  Event Type: Information

  Event ID: 7021
  Date: 4/13/2000

  Computer: EXCHSRV01
  Description:
  Users that were not valid have been removed from the access control list of
  public folder Americas\Texas\Las Colinas.

When the Pub.edb file from the recovery server is copied to the production server
and the service is started, the information store recognizes that the public
store is restored from another server and it logs the following event which says
that the replication will not occur. This event is not accurate because
replication does occur.

  Event Type: Information
  Event Source: MSExchangeIS
  Event Category: Recovery
  Event ID: 1117
  Date: 4/13/2000
  Time: 11:25:23 AM
  User: N/A
  Computer: EXCHSRV01
  Description:
  The public database has been restored to an alternate server. This database
  will no longer be able to replicate with other public databases.

After the information store service is started on the production server, public
folder replication starts. Because the public folders on this server have been
modified more recently than those on the other sites or servers, the changes are
replicated out to the other servers.

When the information store on a server in another site receives the changes,
which indicates that the folders that were previously homed on it are now homed
on another site, the information store removes the directory object for that
public folder from the folder because it assumes that the folder in the new home
site contains the directory service object for the public folder. This folder
change is replicated to all of the servers in the organization. Eventually, all
of the public folder and folder changes are replicated throughout the
organization. After this is finished, the public folders appear to be homed in
the site where the public store is restored, and the re-homed public folders do
not have a corresponding directory object.

Because there is no associated directory object, when you try to get the
properties of a re-homed public folder, you receive the following error message
in the Exchange Administrator program:

  The object cannot be found in the directory. This could be because
  replication has not completed.
