SYMPTOMS
========

Multibyte character set (MBCS) string functions, such as _ismbcspace, that are
provided by the Msvcrt.dll file (version 6.1.8637.0) released with both
Microsoft Windows 2000 and Microsoft Windows ME have a slower performance than
earlier versions of the Msvcrt.dll file released with Microsoft Windows NT 4.0,
Windows 9x, or Visual C++ 6.0. The slower performance affects any application
that directly or indirectly uses the MBCS string functions of the Msvcrt.dll
file.

The Mfc42.dll file is built with a _MBCS processor directive by default, and the
Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC) CString functions use the Msvcrt.dll
file MBCS functions by default. Applications that use MFC CString functions have
a slower performance when they run on Windows 2000 and Windows ME than when they
run on Windows 9x and Windows NT 4.0.

The degree of performance degradation depends on how intensive the application
uses the run-time MBCS string functions or MFC CString functions.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows 2000. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q260910 How to Obtain the Latest Windows 2000 Service Pack

The following are three possible work arounds to resolve the problem:

1. Rebuild the application to statically link to the run-time library. The
  static library does not have the performance delay with MBCS string functions
  on Windows 2000 and Windows ME.

2. Modify the application to be Unicode compatible on Windows 2000. For example,
  use _ttoi(argv[1]) in the sample code located in the "More Information"
  section of this article instead of atoi(argv[1]). Rebuild the application
  with the _UNICODE manifest instead of _MBCS. If the application uses the MFC,
  the Unicode version of the MFC library is used by default. Refer to the MSDN
  library for more information about Unicode programming.

3. If your application only uses single-byte character set (SBCS), rebuild the
  application without the _MBCS manifest. If the application uses the MFC
  CString functions, you will still encounter this MBCS problem because MFC is
  built with _MBCS by default. The following are two possible work arounds for
  this case:

   - Add \MFC\SRC\Strex.cpp to your project, and then compile it without _MBCS.
     The Strex.cpp file implements the CString functions. This may not work if
     your application uses the MFC library indirectly when other DLL's that are
     used by your application use MFC CString functions.

   - Rebuild the MFC library with MBCS=0. Add the MFC42.LIB file to the "Ignore
     Libraries" project setting, and then link your custom MFC library with
     your application. Refer to technician note TN033 for "Rebuilding the MFC
     DLL" procedures.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a bug in the Microsoft products listed at the
beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in Windows 2000
Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce the Behavior
-------------------------------

- Create a Win32 Console Application project with the following code:

  #include &lt;windows.h&gt;
  #include &lt;tchar.h&gt;
  #include &lt;process.h&gt;
  #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

  unsigned int __stdcall threadfunc(void *)
  {
      for (int v = 0; v &lt;= 10000000; ++v)
  	_istspace(' ');
  	return 0;
  }

  int main(int argc, char **argv)
  {
      if (argc != 2)
  	{
  		printf("Usage: &lt;appname.exe&gt; &lt;# of threads&gt;\n");
  		exit(1);
  	}

      int nthreads = atoi(argv[1]);
      //int nthreads = _ttoi(argv[1]);  //UNICODE version

      HANDLE *handles = new HANDLE[nthreads];
  	unsigned int *threadID = new unsigned int[nthreads];

      for (int i = 0; i &lt; nthreads; ++i) {
  	handles[i] = (HANDLE) _beginthreadex(NULL, 0, &amp;threadfunc, NULL, 0, &amp;threadID[i]);
      }

      WaitForMultipleObjects(nthreads, handles, TRUE, INFINITE);

  	delete [] handles;
  	delete [] threadID;

      return 0;
  }

- Build the application using the Multithreaded DLL run-time library Msvcrt.dll
  file. The project is built with the _MBCS processor directive by default and
  _istspace() is mapped to _ismbcspace(). This application runs slower on
  Windows 2000 and Windows ME than on Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 9x.
