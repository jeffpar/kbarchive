SYMPTOMS
========

When you run any of the programs listed at the beginning of this article, sound
or video in the program may be distorted, the program may stop responding
(hang), or the program may quit unexpectedly without generating an error
message. You may also experience choppy game play or poor performance.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the following conditions are true:

- A PCI sound card is installed in the computer.

- A PCI video adapter based on the nVidia Riva TNT chip set is installed in the
  computer.

- The sound card and the video adapter share the same Interrupt Request (IRQ)
  setting.

- You cannot configure the sound card or the video adapter to use a different
  IRQ setting.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, replace the sound card or the video adapter with a sound
card or a video adapter that does not require an IRQ setting that is used by the
other device.

For example, replace the PCI video card with an AGP video card.

Microsoft recommends that you first contact your computer manufacturer to obtain
a replacement part.

You may also want to consult the manufacturer of the sound card or the video
adapter to determine if either device can be configured to use a different IRQ
setting.

MORE INFORMATION
================

An Interrupt Request is a hardware line over which a device such as an
Input/Output port, a keyboard, or a disk drive sends requests for service to the
microprocessor when the device is ready to send or to receive information.

IRQ settings are numbered from 0 to 15. Each device must use a unique IRQ
setting. To determine if more than one device is sharing an IRQ setting in
Microsoft Windows 95:

1. Right-click the My Computer icon on the desktop, and then click Properties.

2. Click the Device Manager tab.

3. Double-click Computer.

4. On the View Resources tab, click "Interrupt request (IRQ)".

  If your sound card and your video adapter share the same IRQ setting, then you
  may experience the symptoms described in the "Symptoms" section of this
  article.

5. Click OK, and then click OK again.

To determine if more than one device is sharing an IRQ setting in Microsoft
Windows 98, Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition (Me), or Microsoft Windows
2000:

1. Click Start, point to Run, type "msinfo32" (without the quotation marks), and
  then click OK.

2. Click Hardware.

3. Click IRQs or Conflicts/Sharing.


To identify the manufacturer and the model of your video adapter:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. If you are using a Microsoft Windows 95 or a Microsoft Windows 98-based
  computer, click the Device Manager tab.

  If you are using a Microsoft Windows 2000-based computer, click the Hardware
  tab, and then click Device Manager.

4. Click the plus sign (+) next to "Display adapters" to expand the branch.

5. Under the "Display adapters" branch, note the manufacturer and the model of
  your video adapter, and then click OK.

6. Close all open windows on the desktop.
