-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server versions 2.0, 2.0 SP1, 2.0 SP2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When Discovery Data Manager (DDM) is processing Data Discovery Records (DDRs),
it may be unable to properly delete the DDRs after inserting them into the
database or forwarding them to the parent site in the hierarchy. Because the
files are not properly deleted, they are processed repeatedly, causing
unnecessary CPU usage and network traffic. This problem can compound quickly in
a site hierarchy because several child sites might be forwarding replica DDRs
repeatedly to the parent site along with legitimate DDRs. Large backlogs of DDR
files may result in the DDM inbox.

CAUSE
=====

DDM is unable to delete DDRs because they have a read-only attribute set.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
