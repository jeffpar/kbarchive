SYMPTOMS
========

When you attempt to install one of the programs listed at the beginning of this
article, you may receive the following error message:

  Setup encountered a disk error while writing to the file &lt;filename&gt;.
  Make sure that your hard disk is not full, and that the file is not in use.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if either of the following conditions is true:

- A real mode (16-bit) CD-ROM driver is installed on your computer.

- Your CD-ROM drive is operating in MS-DOS Compatibility mode.

- Your CD-ROM drive is unable to properly read the media.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, follow these troubleshooting methods in the order in
which they appear.

Method 1
--------

Determine if your CD-ROM drive is using a protected mode driver:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. Click the Performance tab, and then verify that the File System entry is
  32-bit.

  If the File System entry is "Some drives are using MS-DOS compatibility", your
  CD-ROM drive may be using a real mode CD-ROM driver. If this is the case, you
  may not be able to read certain files on the CD-ROM.

4. Click OK, and then close Control Panel.

NOTE: If the File System entry is "32-bit" (without the quotation marks), your
CD-ROM drive may be using both a real mode CD-ROM driver and a protected mode
CD-ROM driver.

For information about how to remove the real mode CD-ROM driver, contact the
manufacturer of your CD-ROM drive.

  Q60781 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, L-P

  Q60782 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, Q-Z

If the issue continues to occur, proceed to the next method.

Method 2
--------

Reduce CD-ROM Drive Caching:

1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

2. Double-click System.

3. On the Performance tab, click File System.

4. On the CD-ROM tab, move the "Supplemental Cache Size" slider to the Small
  position.

5. In the "Optimize Access Pattern For" box, click "No Read-Ahead".

6. Click OK, and then click Close.

7. When you receive the prompt to restart your computer, click Yes.

Method 3
