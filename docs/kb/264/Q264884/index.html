-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Video Acceleration feature for Microsoft Windows 2000-based clients is not
supported in versions of Systems Management Server (SMS) 2.0 prior to Service
Pack 3 (SP3). Therefore, remotely controlling a Windows 2000-based client may be
two to six times slower than a similar Remote Control session on a Microsoft
Windows NT 4.0-based clients.

CAUSE
=====

The slow performance occurs because there is no video acceleration capability
for Windows 2000-based clients in the SMS Remote Control video drivers, which
are used to transfer the video during a Remote Control session.

The slow video performance during a Remote Control session is not an indication
of poor performance of Windows 2000.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q288239 SMS: How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service
  Pack

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 3.
