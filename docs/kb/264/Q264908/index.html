-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Internet Information Services version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you connect to Internet Information Services using a browser, you may
receive the following error message:

  HTTP 403.15 - Forbidden: Client Access Licenses exceeded
  Internet Information Services

  The number of authenticated users has exceeded the number of Client Access
  Licenses (CAL).

The Event Viewer may log the following error message(s):

  Event ID: 27
  Source: W3SVC
  Description: The server was unable to acquire a license for a SSL connection.

  Event ID: 201
  Source: LicenseService
  Description: No license was available for user &lt;username&gt; using product
  IIS 5.0.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused by one of two things:

- The number of authenticated users has exceeded the number of Client Access
  Licenses (CAL).

-or-

- The number of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) users (anonymous or authenticated)
  has exceeded the number of CALs installed on the server.

NOTE: If the License Logging Service is stopped, then only ten concurrent SSL
connections are accepted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows 2000. For
additional information, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q260910 How to Obtain the Latest Windows 2000 Service Pack

There are two counters at work in this scenario:

- a counter for CALs
- a counter for SSL connections

By default, the SSL connection limit is set to the number of CALs, which also
applies to anonymous SSL connections. Microsoft is aware of this issue and a
hotfix is available that will allow an unlimited number of SSL connections
regardless of the number of CALs.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  Date      Time       Version        Size     File name
  ------------------------------------------------------
  6/1/2000  9:46:36AM  5.0.2195.2096  356,112  W3svc.dll



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Internet Information Services
version 5.0. This problem was first corrected in Windows 2000 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NOTE: This section describes the behavior of the problem as it exists without
the hotfix. The hotfix mentioned in the "Resolution" section of this article
fixes this behavior.

SSL connection counting: Each SSL connection (anonymous or authenticated)
decrements the SSL connection counter. This counter is initialized with the
total number of CALs that are installed on the system. For example, if you have
10 CALs installed on a Web server, then the server will support up to 10
concurrent SSL connections.

To better understand CALs and SSL connection counting, review the following
scenarios:

- An anonymous user browses a public Web site. No CALs are consumed. Anonymous
  users do not consume CALs.

- An anonymous user attempts to access a page that requires a logon. The user
  is authenticated and granted access to the page. One CAL is consumed. Each
  uniquely authenticated user consumes one CAL.

- An anonymous user attempts to access a page that requires a logon. The user
  is authenticated and granted access to the page. The same user opens a second
  Web browser and browses to the same page. He or she authenticates with the
  same username. One CAL is consumed. Each uniquely authenticated user consumes
  one CAL regardless of the number of connections to the same server.

- An anonymous user browses to a commerce Web site and shops, adding items to a
  shopping cart. When this user goes to pay (transition into an SSL session),
  one SSL connection is consumed for that username. No CALs are consumed. SSL
  connections do not consume CALs, but the total number of SSL connections is
  limited to the number of CALs installed on the Web server.

- A Web server has 20 CALs installed. It can support up to 20 authenticated
  users in addition to 20 SSL (anonymous and/or authenticated) connections
  concurrently. If a user is authenticated and using SSL, then a CAL is
  consumed and the SSL connection counter is decremented by one. Only the act
  of authenticating requires a CAL. Internet Information Server maintains a
  separate counter for SSL connections.

- An anonymous user browses to an intranet Web site. The same user is also
  authenticated to the same Web server by an external authentication mechanism
  such as a UNC network share (\\Computername\Share). One CAL is consumed. The
  anonymous account does not consume CALs, but authenticated users do.

- An anonymous user attempts to access a page requiring a logon. The user is
  authenticated and is granted access to the page. The user is also
  authenticated to the same Web server by an external authentication mechanism
  such as a universal naming convention (UNC) network share
  (\\Computername\Share) to the same server. One CAL is consumed. Each uniquely
  authenticated user consumes one CAL when connecting to the same Web server
  regardless of multiple connections.
