Scroll Bar on Compose Note Jumps Up and Down:

Q80653

In versions 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the scroll
bars on a compose note may jump around when three or more lines are entered
very quickly.

No Split Menu Item When Message Finder Is Open:

Q81419

When the Message Finder viewer is open in versions 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows, the View menu does not contain the Split
command (although it is available in the view's system menu).

NOTE: All other views contain a Split command on the View menu.

Selected Order of Messages Open Out of Order:

Q81552

In versions 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, messages in
the Message Center Viewer (MCV), sometimes cannot be opened in the order in
which they are displayed.

Messages that are visible and highlighted in the MCV are opened in their
appropriate order, but selected messages that you have scrolled past in the
MCV are not. This same sort of behavior exists if you selectively highlight
random messages (hold the CTRL key and click with the mouse button) and
scroll past the initial MCV view.

Meeting Request Subject Incorrect in Shared Folder:

Q82268

If versions 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows receives a
Schedule+ for Windows meeting request and the message is then moved to a
shared folder, the subject line is changed to something like,

  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;!3/20/92 17:00-17...

instead of the correct subject line as displayed in a private folder.

The right subject line appears when you read the message; only the
summary in the shared folder displays the incorrect subject.

Stack Fault When Spell Checking a Long Section of Text:

Q82915

Versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows sometimes display
this error message when spell checking a very long string of characters
containing no blank spaces:

  Stack Fault in MSSPELL.DLL

Err Msg: This Name or Comment Is Too Long:

Q82921

When creating or modifying a shared folder in version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows, you may receive this error message if the name
or comment exceeds the maximum length:

  This name or comment is too long. Type a shorter name or comment.

Shared Folder Status Bar Has No Message Count:

Q82922

The status bar in version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows
does not display the message count of an open shared folder.

No Paperclip Icon on Message with OLE Object:

Q84884

If you move a message with an object linking and embedding (OLE) object to
a shared folder in version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows,
the icon next to the message does not display a paperclip. If you move the
message back to a private folder, the paperclip icon reappears.

This occurs only with OLE objects, not with regular file attachments.

Modified Status Lost in Move to Shared Folder:

Q85167

Moving a modified message to a shared folder in version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2
of Microsoft Mail for Windows, causes the modified status to become lost.
Modified messages are identified by an asterisk (*) to the left of the
From line, for example, *From: John Doe.

Setup Does Not Add SHARE.EXE to AUTOEXEC.BAT:

Q85199

If you boot a machine from the floppy drive before running the Setup
program for version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the
AUTOEXEC.BAT file on the boot disk does not get modified.

For instance, the Setup program prompts you to add the line SHARE.EXE to
the AUTOEXEC.BAT file if you want SHARE loaded automatically. However, when
you add the line, it is not written to the AUTOEXEC.BAT on the boot disk or
the hard drive.

Packaged Object Icon Changes After Reading:

Q85672

With version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the icon for
an object embedded within a message may change after the object is read.

Two OLE Objects on One Line Print on Two Lines:

Q85695

Multiple object linking and embedding (OLE) objects placed on the same
line in version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows are
printed on separate lines.

Embedded Paintbrush Object Does Not Print Color:

Q85967

Color is lost when you print a version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 Microsoft Mail
for Windows message containing an embedded Windows version 3.1 Paintbrush
picture.

Excel 4.0 Chart May Appear Smaller Than Normal:

Q85968

A Microsoft Excel version 4.0 for Windows chart embedded in a version 3.0,
3.0b, or 3.2 Microsoft Mail for Windows message sometimes appears smaller
than normal.

Multiple Update Prompts With OLE Objects:

Q85969

When you print a message in version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for
Windows that contains an object linking and embedding (OLE) object, a
dialog box prompts you to update information even if the OLE object is
currently updated.

Missing Information in Paste Special Dialog Box:

Q85970

Version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows does not display
file information correctly in the Pasted Special Option dialog box when
an object linking and embedding (OLE) object is placed in a message.

Space Requirements Incorrect on Custom Setup:

Q86003

When you run the Custom Setup for version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft
Mail for Windows, the required disk space reported might be incorrect
depending on whether the files already exist on the disk.

Unexpected Exit Permanently Locks Shared Folder:

Q86082

If a shared folder is open and version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft
Mail for Windows exits unexpectedly, the shared folder will not be
unlocked and therefore cannot be deleted.

OLE Object Redraws Slowly in Message:

Q86090

When you compose a message in version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
for Windows that contains an object linking and embedding (OLE) object
with text above and below it, the screen redraws of the OLE object may be
very slow.

OLE Apps Have Unexpected Window Stacking Order:

Q86091

In version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, using the
ALT+TAB function to toggle between applications and close the object
linking and embedding (OLE) Server application, sometimes causes an
unexpected window stacking order.

Highlighting OLE Objects Within Message:

Q86092

In version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, if you compose
a message containing an object linking and embedding (OLE) object followed
by a large block of text, you may have trouble highlighting the text and
the OLE object.

Attach Dialog Box May Update Improperly:

Q86093

If you attempt to attach from a floppy disk after removing it, version 3.0,
3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows sometimes displays this
incorrect error message:

  Cannot find this file.
  Please verify that the correct path and filename are given.

The expected error should be

  Cannot read drive "x"
  Please verify the drive door is closed and that the disk is formatted.

where x is the floppy disk drive.

Problems Attaching MSMAIL.EXE in Foreign Windows:

Q86184

If you use version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows with
the French or German edition of Microsoft Windows version 3.1, attaching
the MSMAIL.EXE file to a message causes the system to become unstable,
and you have to restart the Windows 3.1 operating environment. This
problem occurs only with foreign editions of Windows version 3.1.

Drag/Drop Makes Folder Hierarchy Display Incorrect:

Q86315

In version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the folder
hierarchy display can become incorrect after you drag-and-drop folders
from the top level to a lower level two or more times in succession.
Scrolling the list up or down corrects the display.

From Field Changes Friendly Name to Login Name:

Q86316

In version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows moving a message
to a shared folder changes the friendly name (for example, Karen White) in
the From field to the login name (for example, karenwh).

Message Finder Icon Does Not Update:

Q86317

In version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the Message
Finder icon may continue to display an envelope when its message has
actually been opened or deleted.

Update Message when Closing Unfinished OLE Object:

Q86319

In version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, if you exit
while composing a note containing an unfinished object linking and
embedding (OLE) object (where Mail is the client document and the OLE
server is open and no update has been done) you see the standard OLE
"Do you want to update..." message even when the note being composed is
not the current active window.

Cannot Minimize Message Finder Using Keyboard:

Q86321

When running version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows under
Microsoft Windows version 3.1, the Minimize option is unavailable in the
Control menu of a new Message Finder, if you access it using the
combination ALT+SPACEBAR, RIGHT ARROW key.

This problem occurs only when you use a new Message Finder. Once you have
minimized and restored Message Finder, the Minimize option is available.

Creating Subfolders Illegally Under Shared Folders:

Q86324

In version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, you can create
a subfolder under a shared folder for which you have no privileges.

Text in Comment Field Not Selected:

Q86325

In version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, if you select
Folder Properties from the File menu, the text in the Comment field is
not selected when it has the focus. To select the text in the Comment
field you must press TAB. (Developers should note this when developing
scripts to be executed against Mail for Windows.)

Header Displayed in Message Body:

Q86329

When a message is sent to a shared folder from a Microsoft Mail for PC
Networks, MS-DOS workstation, then opened in version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows, the header information is displayed in the
message text.

Cannot Forward or Reply on Return Receipts:

Q86330

Normally, in version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the
Forward, Reply, and Reply All options are not available when a return
receipt message is selected. These options are available, however, if the
return receipt message is located in a shared folder, but once you select
one you are notified that it cannot be executed.

Err Msg: The Folder Conversion Program...:

Q86389

In version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the following
error message is displayed when the folder conversion program (CONVERT.EXE)
does not have sufficient memory to run:

  The folder conversion program cannot access your message file.
  Make sure that you can sign into Microsoft Mail and try again.

Change Default Printer in Windows Not Change in Mail:

Q88371

Changing the default printer driver for version 3.1 of Microsoft Windows
does not change the printer driver for version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows. To update Mail, choose Print from the File
menu, select the Setup button, then choose the OK button.

Custom Dictionary Not Loaded When it Should Be:

Q91730

If you press the F7 key to spell check a message in version 3.0, 3.0b, or
3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows and try to add a misspelled word to your
custom dictionary, Microsoft Mail tells you that no custom dictionary has
been opened.

Setup Does Not Change Language for Speller:

Q93074

If you install version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows,
with the spell checking facility for one language, then install Mail with
the spell checking facility for another language, spell checking will not
work. If you try to check spelling in a message, Mail for Windows reports
an error in loading the spell checker.

Fault in 8514.DRV After Typing in a Text Box:

Q93238

When composing a message in version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for
Windows, if you enter information in the TO: field, choose to resolve the
name, double-click the resolved name and then enter 30 characters in the
name field, you may get an error message indicating that there has been a
fault in 8514.DRV.

Wordwrap Does Not Work Correctly When Using Tabs:

Q93241

When composing a message using tabs in version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail for Windows, the wordwrap function may not work correctly.

Backup MMF Allows Composing But Not Sending:

Q93242

When using a backup of your Mail Message File (MMF) in version 3.0, 3.0b,
or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, you sometimes can compose a message
but cannot transmit it to the postoffice. The sent message just sits in
your outbox.

Appears to Hang When Printing from Shared Folder:

Q93566

Version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, may appear to hang
(stop responding) when you print a large message from within a shared
folder.

Select All Does Not Highlight Any Messages:

Q93567

In version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, choosing Select
All from the Edit menu sometimes fails in folders containing a large number
of messages.

Attachment Icon Redraws When Using BACKSPACE Key:

Q93572

In version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the icon for an
attachment appears to disappear and be redrawn each time you press the
BACKSPACE key on the line containing the attachment or on the line below
it.

No Beep When Requested for New Mail:

Q93573

In version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the computer
does not beep when a new message arrives. Even if you have set the option
to alert you when new mail arrives, the envelope flashes, as it should, but
the beep does not sound.

Wrong Button Discussed in "Find a Name" Help Topic:

Q93574

Help topics in version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows,
mistakenly identify the Find button as the Search button.

WINMAIL.DAT File Appears in 2.1 Clients:

Q94180

If you send one or more enclosures with a message using version 3.0, 3.0b,
or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows to a version 2.1 of Microsoft Mail for
PC Networks workstation, an extra attachment with the name WINMAIL.DAT
appears. The system may hang while trying to save this file even though it
should not be saved; it is used by Mail for Windows only as a resource
file.

Cannot Reply If Attachment Is Deleted:

Q95963

In version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, when you reply
to a message that originally contained an attachment that is now deleted,
this error occurs:

  Stop: A New Message Could Not Be Created.

Err Msg: A TPL File Has Been Incorrectly Modified...:

Q96500

In versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, you may
receive the following error message when selecting details on a user
from the postoffice address list:

  A TPL file has been incorrectly modified. Contact your Administrator.


Err Msg: File Error:

Q101614

In versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, selecting
Demos from the Help menu generates a "File Error" error message.

Print Quality Always Set to High:

Q102086

When you print from version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for
Windows, print Quality always defaults to high, even when the printer
driver is set for draft.

New Mail Dialog Appears But No Mail Is Retrieved:

Q102654

In versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, choosing
New Messages from the View menu causes the "Checking for new messages"
dialog to appear briefly and then disappear, but no new mail is retrieved
and no error message is displayed.

Err Msg: There Was an Unknown Disk Error:

Q102665

When you save a message to a file, version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft
Mail for Windows does not determine if there is enough disk space before it
starts writing the file. If the file already exists, Mail overwrites it. If
there is not enough disk space, Mail truncates the file and displays this
alert:

  There was an unknown disk error. Some data was written disk.

NOTE: This message should say "written to disk."

Saving Composed Message When Net Connection Goes Down:

Q103238

If the network goes down while you are composing a message in version
3.0, 3.0b, 3.1, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows and you try to
exit Mail or save the message in the Inbox, the following message is
displayed:

  There is not enough memory or system resources to save changes.

Folder Names Limited to 127 Characters:

Q103448

When you create a new folder in version 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft
Mail for Windows, the following error may occur:

  This name or comment is too long. Type a shorter name or comment.

Address Book Does Not Limit Extended Characters:

Q103449

Versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.1, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows do not
check the validity of characters typed in fields in the Address Book
and its related dialog boxes. Therefore, invalid characters can be
typed in fields.

For example, you can type letters in the Fax Number box. Data checking
occurs only for fields that require data to be entered and for
carriage return-linefeeds (for the Personal Address Book).

You can also type invalid characters in the New User dialog box, and
the Address Book will accept these characters.

Missing Cc: Line in Sent Mail Folder:

Q103451

In versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, if the
first recipient listed in the To: field of a message is also the first
recipient listed in the Cc: field, Mail drops the first recipient's name
from the Cc: field when the message is saved in the Sent Mail folder.

Maximum Size Message Gets Truncated When Sent:

Q103455

In versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.1, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, and
version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for Windows for Workgroups, when you try
to read a message that is the maximum size possible, the following
warning appears and the last two characters of the message are
truncated:

  The message is too large to fit into memory all at once.
  Some of it will not be displayed.

A related problem occurs if the message contains an attachment as the
last character. When the message is saved or sent, and then read again
by the sender, Mail experiences a general protection (GP) fault.

Mail Will Not Start Minimized from Word Macro:

Q103456

You cannot use a Microsoft Word for Windows macro to start version 3.0,
3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows minimized with the Shell
command. For example, when you use the following query, Mail launches,
but it is not minimized.

     shell "c:\msmail\msmail.exe", 0

File Manager Send Mail Option Hangs Computer:

Q103457

With versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the
computer may appear to stop responding (hang) when you choose Send Mail
from the Windows File Manager Mail menu. This problem occurs only if you
use ALT+TAB to select Program Manager and then select (double-click) File
Manager a second time.

Messages Not Imported from Backup MMF If Already Exist:

Q103697

When you try to import a backed-up Mail Message File (MMF) into
version 3.0b, 3.1, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, Mail asks you
how to handle duplicate messages. If you choose Save All Messages,
Mail copies messages from the imported MMF file except for those that
are duplicates with the same modification date.

This may be confusing because some messages from the MMF file will be
copied into the destination folder, while others may not.

GP Fault Occurs When Copying or Pasting Text:

Q103792

In versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, a general
protection (GP) fault occurs when you copy or paste a text block larger
than 32K.

MAPIHELP=path Not Updated When Mail Is Installed:

Q103814

The MAPIHelp=&lt;path&gt; setting in the MSMAIL.INI file does not get
updated when you install version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows
over an existing older version and the setup directory differs from
the existing mail directory.

Return Receipt Won't Print Color on IBM Color Printer:

Q103912

With versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.1, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows,
the Return Receipt option does not print in color on an IBM Color
Printer.

GP Fault Copying Many Messages to Shared Folder:

Q103944

When you copy a large number of messages (about 800, possibly less)
to a shared folder, versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for
Windows cause a general protection (GP) fault in the MSSFS.DLL file.

Header Fields May Be Misaligned When Redrawn:

Q103958

Versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows may display
misaligned edit boxes--the To: box is where the Cc: box should be, the
Cc: box is where the Subject: box should be, the Subject: box is one
line below its usual position, and there is nothing where the To: box
should be.

No Sound with View New Messages Notification:

Q103986

With versions 3.0, 3.0b and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, if you
choose New Messages from the View menu and find new mail, the envelope
flashes but the new-mail chime does not sound.

Can't Jump to End of Address List by Typing "zz":

Q104031

In versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, trying to
jump to the last name in the Address List by typing the character "z"
twice ("zz"), returns the following error:

  Address: An error occurred while trying to access the name service.
  (0000024E)

This problem occurs only in the postoffice address list, not in the
global address list, personal address book, or gateway lists.

TrueType Fonts Do Not Work Properly with Mail:

Q104084

Versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows allow you
to specify both a normal (proportional) font and a fixed (nonproportional)
font in the MSMAIL.INI file. If you select a TrueType font as the
FixedFont and then choose Change Font from the View menu within a mail
message, no visible change occurs on the screen--the TrueType font chosen
as FixedFont does not appear.

Messages with Same Time Stamp Are Sorted Incorrectly:

Q104108

In versions 3.0, 3.0b, 3.1, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows,
messages received with the same time stamp do not get sorted correctly:
they appear in a folder in the order they were placed in it and are not
sorted automatically by their From field.

Mail Stops Downloading Messages When .MBG Is Detected:

Q104277

When you use versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows
to download messages from the .MBG file, you are disconnected if Mail
encounters a corrupt message, and Mail does not download any more valid
messages.

Check for New Mail Time Is Twice the User Setting:

Q104913

In version 3.0, 3.0b or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows and version 3.0
of Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, OS/2 workstation, Mail actually
checks for new messages at twice the rate displayed in the Mail Options
dialog box. For example, if the Check For New Mail Every X Minutes
option is set to 5, Mail checks for new messages every 10 minutes.

NOTE: The Mail Options dialog box also controls how often Mail checks
the outbox for messages to submit to the postoffice.

Missing _MSSETUP.EXE Causes Setup to Abort:

Q105107

In versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, when you
run the Setup program (SETUP.EXE), the Windows client Setup screen
flashes momentarily and then returns to File Manager or Program
Manager without completing the setup process.

Folder Rebuild Does Not Display Status Information:

Q107354

In versions 3.0, 3.0b, and 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, the Windows
client will rebuild a corrupt folder without displaying any type of status
message. This may cause you to assume the client is hung when it is
actually performing a rebuild operation.

Global Address List Name Search Returns All Names:

Q108026

In versions 3.0, 3.0b, or 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows, when
performing a name search on the Global Address List (GAL), if the selection
criterion is the surname and first initial of the given name, and these
letters are the same(for example, Smith, Steve) then all names that match
the surname will be returned.

StripGatewayHeaders Limited to 75 Recipients:

Q108830

Version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail for Windows includes in the [Microsoft Mail]
section of MSMAIL.INI the StripGatewayHeaders switch to remove extra
headers from foreign systems being displayed in the body of the message.
This switch does not work for messages with 76 recipients or more.
