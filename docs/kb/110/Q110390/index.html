The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0, 4.0 SP1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

To automatically start SNA Server when you start your system, use the Services
application to configure the SnaServer service startup method as Automatic.
Also, if you are using NetView alerts and Run command, the NVAlert and NVRunCmd
services should also be configured to start automatically.

For SNA Server version 2.x, all other SNA Serve services are automatically
started by SNA Server as needed, even though they are configured for manual
start (this includes any SNA Server link services and SnaNetMn). In the case of
SnaNetNm, this service displays an error message if the user attempt to start it
through Control Panel.

With SNA Server versions 3.0 and 4.0, the following services need to be setup
through Control Panel/Services in order to start automatically: Shared Folders
Gateway, TN3270, TN5250, SNAPrint. All other 3.0 and 4.0 services are started
automatically.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Following is a description of each SNA Server service, and how each service is
configured to start when SNA Server is installed:

SnaBase: Automatic startup. This service must be started before any other SNA
Server service can run.

NOTE: You can configure SnaBase for manual startup where the first SNA
application to be started causes SnaBase to start automatically. However, for
this to work, the Windows NT user must have sufficient privilege to start it
(that is, the user's account must belong to the Administrators, Server Operator,
or Power User group). So, it is recommended that SnaBase be left at "Automatic
startup".

SnaServer: Manual startup. This can be changed to Automatic startup if desired.
This may also be started/stopped using the SNA Server Admin program.

SNA Server link services (SnaDlc1, SnaSdlc1, and so on): Manual startup.

SNA Server automatically starts the link services as needed. These services
should NOT be configured to automatically start using Control Panel.
Specifically, the SnaBase service starts these automatically. Also, the
SnaServer service doesn't start unless all link services used by this server are
running.

NVAlert, NVRunCmd: Manual startup. These services can be changed to Automatic
startup if desired. SNA Server will not automatically start these services.

SnaNetMn: Manual startup. SNA Server will automatically start this service if
NetView connectivity is configured on an SNA Server connection. This service
should NOT be configured to automatically start using Control Panel, and fails
with the following error message if the administrator tries to start it
manually:

  SNA Server Error #0352
  Unable to open the configuration file, rc=618

Additional services available in SNA Server versions 3.0 and later:

Shared Folders Gateway: Manual startup. This service can be changed to Automatic
startup if desired.

SNA MngAgent: Manual startup. This service should not be changed to Automatic
startup. It will be started automatically when SnaBase is started.

Sna RPC Service: Manual startup. This service should not be changed to Automatic
startup. It will be started automatically when SnaBase is started.

SnaPrint: Manual startup. This service can be changed to Automatic startup if
desired.

TN3270: Manual startup. This service can be changed to Automatic startup if
desired.

TN5250: Manual startup. This service can be changed to Automatic startup if
desired.

SNA Host Account Synchronization: Manual startup. This service should not be
configured for Automatic startup. It will be started automatically if SNA
Server's Host Security features are installed and configured.

SNA Host Account Cache: Automatic startup.

SNA WinNT Account Synchronization: Automatic startup.
