Product(s): Microsoft SNA Server
Version(s): WINDOWS:2.0
Operating System(s): 
Keyword(s): kbnetwork
Last Modified: 13-JUN-2001

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, version 2.0, on platform(s):
   - the operating system: Microsoft Windows NT 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

SNA Server services are designed to run under the System account, and fail to
run if the administrator changes any of the services to start under a user
context.

CAUSE
=====

The SNA Server setup program automatically configures all SNA Server services to
"Log On" under the System account. This includes SnaBase, SnaServer, any SNA
link services, SnaNetMn, NVAlert, and NVRunCmd. If any of the services are
changed to run under a user context, they will not run.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the Control Panel window, choose the Services icon, and then choose the
Startup button and make sure all SNA Server services are configured to start
under the System account.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article.
Microsoft is researching this problem and will post more information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base when it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following are the errors that may occur if these services were configured to
start in any account OTHER than the System account:
