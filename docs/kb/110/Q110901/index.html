Mac Fax: Creating Fax Gateway Account Cover Pages:

Article ID: Q81342

You can configure the Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks Gateway to Fax to
send a cover page with each fax transmission. You need to first create a cover
page using any non-PostScript application that has printing capabilities.

1. Leave the top 2 to 3 inches of the document blank because transmission
  information is placed at the top of the page when a cover page is used.

2. In the Chooser, select MailSender.

3. Print the document. When the MailSender print dialog opens, click the Save
  File radio button.

4. When the "Save Image File As" dialog appears, click the Formats button and
  select "FAXGATE Cover Page" from the list of formats. Save the file and copy
  it to the master fax gateway server's hard disk where it will be safe from
  accidental deletion.

5. At the Macintosh serving as the master fax gateway server, sign into Mail as
  the Network Manager.

6. Choose Gateway Accounts from the Mail menu and click the Modify radio button.

7. Select a gateway account.

8. Click the Cover Page button and select any cover page file that you have
  previously created. Each gateway account can have a unique cover page
  assigned to it. Repeat Steps 7 and 8 to set the cover page for other gateway
  accounts.

Mac Fax: Fax Gateway Cover Pages and Mail Server Application:

Article ID: Q81346

When running the Microsoft Mail server as an application, the Mail for AppleTalk
Networks Gateway to Fax gateway does not allow you to make changes to cover page
assignments. Changes to the cover page option are made in the Gateway Accounts
screen and must be made at the server. Even when sitting at the server, you will
receive the following error after clicking on the Cover Page button:

  You are not allowed to assign cover pages from a remote machine

To make changes to the cover page option, bring the server up as an INIT, make
the desired changes, change the server back to an application.

Mac Svr Wkst: Compatibility with A/UX:

Article ID: Q96253

Although the workstation of version 3.1 of Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks
is compatible with Apple's A/UX environment, the server is not compatible.
Earlier versions of the Mail workstation are not compatible.

The only known problem with A/UX and the version 3.1 workstation is that the
chime will only sound once on the arrival of new mail, even if set to 2 or 3
chimes.

Mac ARA: AppleLink Gateway Conflicts with ARA:

Article ID: Q96275

The communication program in the AppleLink gateway will not function correctly
with AppleTalk Remote Access (ARA) version 1.0. If ARA is installed on the
server with an AppleLink master gateway and the communication program in the
AppleLink gateway tries to initiate a call, the following error message will
occur:

  Ramsdopen: -97

Mac GW: CNU Needs MultiFinder:

Article ID: Q97956

The Connection Name Utility (CNU) of the Microsoft Mail Connection for PC and
AppleTalk Networks version 1.0x needs to run on a mail server using System 7 or
System 6 with MultiFinder enabled. With System 6, operating with Finder only may
cause errors.

Mac Wkst: Enclosed Documents Become Unlocked:

Article ID: Q101445

If a document enclosed within a mail message using version 3.0 or 3.1 of
Microsoft Mail for AppleTalk Networks has the Locked feature enabled via the Get
Info box, that document will arrive at the recipient's mail account unlocked.

Mac Wkst: Mail Notification Has Stopped Working:

Article ID: Q101904
