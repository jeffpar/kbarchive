The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Metadirectory Services 2.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

When you run a management agent, the delta values for "Last Update Time" are not
incremented, or are set to a value of zero. This problem occurs with several
management agents, including the Report management agent and the Exchange LDAP
management agent.

CAUSE
=====

There are actually two issues:

- There is a timestamp reset from the current value to a value of all zeroes
  (for example, "000000000000-0000.00") when you operate the management agent
  with delta operations not enabled.

- "Last Foreign Users Update Time" is not updated when you run the management
  agent with delta operations enabled.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next version of Microsoft Metadirectory Services that contains this
fix.
