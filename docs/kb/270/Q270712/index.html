-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Messaging Application Programming Interface (MAPI), Post Office Protocol version
3 (POP3), Internet Message Access Protocol, Version 4rev1 (IMAP4), and Hypertext
Transfer Protocol (HTTP) e-mail clients may experience very slow response from
the Exchange Server information store, and gradually the information store may
stop responding to the clients.

When a Microsoft Outlook user tries to log on, the user receives the following
error message:

  The Microsoft Exchange Server computer is not available. Either there are
  network issues or the Microsoft Exchange server is down for maintenance.

The Microsoft Windows Task Manager displays high CPU use for the Exchange Server
information store and a large number of threads in the Store.exe process. The
number of threads in the Store.exe process continues to increase, which causes
the Store.exe process to stop responding.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur if the information store process becomes stuck indefinitely
in a loop when a folder cannot be deleted.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server 5.5.
