MORE INFORMATION
================

CD-ROM: CD Label Is Inaccurate
------------------------------

The CD label incorrectly refers to Exam 70-222. The label should be changed
from:

"MCSE Training Kit For Exam 70-222
Upgrading to Windows 2000"

To:

"MCSE Training Kit
Upgrading to Microsoft Windows 2000"


Incorrect ISBN Printed In Several Locations
-------------------------------------------

The incorrect ISBN can be found on the Library of Congress page (the Copyright
page)at the beginning of the book, as well as the Registration and Proof of
Purchase cards in the back of the book.

Change the ISBN in these locations from:
ISBN 0-7356-0940-3

To:
ISBN 0-7356-1246-3


Page 25: Remove References To Alpha Processors
----------------------------------------------

On page 25, in Table 2.1, remove all references to Alpha-based processors and
computers. Windows 2000 does not support the Alpha processor.
