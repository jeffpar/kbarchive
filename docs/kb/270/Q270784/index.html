SYMPTOMS
========

When you take the Virtual Challenge in one of the Encarta Language Learning
programs listed at the beginning of this article, the recording part of the
challenge may finish before you finish speaking.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur for any of the following reasons:

- There is a moment of silence at the beginning or in the middle of the
  recording.

- You pronounce words too slowly.

- You stutter when you pronounce some words.

- You do not pronounce words clearly or you mumble.

- You speak too softly.

- You are not speaking into the microphone.

- The volume of the microphone is too low or muted.

- The microphone or sound card is not working correctly.


NOTE: Voice recognition in the Virtual Challenge is designed to stop recording
when you finish speaking.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, use the following methods in the order in which they are
presented.

Pronounce Your Words Correctly
------------------------------

The primary cause of this issue is pronunciation. Slight pauses or delays in the
pronunciation of words can cause this issue to occur.

When you learn to speak a language, pronunciation can be one of the hardest parts
of speaking fluently. You may need to practice your pronunciation before you
attempt the Virtual Challenges.

The following suggestions can help with pronunciation:

- Meet with a friend or a teacher and have them provide you with feedback on
  your pronunciation.

- Record yourself speaking the language, and then listen to your own
  pronunciation.

- Use the Speaking exercises that are included with the Encarta Language
  Learning program.

Run the Microphone Wizard
-------------------------

To run Microphone Wizard:

1. Start the Encarta Language Learning program.

2. On the Options menu, click Microphone Wizard.

  NOTE: The Options menu may not be displayed if the Encarta Language Learning
  program is run in a small window.

3. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the Microphone Wizard.

Increase the Microphone Volume Setting
--------------------------------------

To increase the microphone volume:

1. Start the Encarta Language Learning program.

2. On the Options menu, click Volume Control.

3. Click to clear the Mute check box, and move the Volume slider up to increase
  the volume.
