-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 2.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When multiple Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) addresses
are bound to one network adapter, the discovery data collected from the client
only reports one of the TCP/IP addresses.

When viewing the client properties in the Systems Management Server Administrator
console the Client or AgentSite attributes will not show the expected data. The
Client property may be set to 0 (not installed) when it should be set to 1
(installed), and AgentSite property may be blank. Additionally, only the first
TCP/IP address of the client is listed. If the first TCP/IP address is 0.0.0.0
there will be no TCP/IP address listed.

CAUSE
=====

The Systems Management Server discovery process only captures one TCP/IP address
per network adapter.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, click the following article
number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack


WORKAROUND
==========

Make sure that the client's TCP/IP address that is within the Systems Management
Server site boundaries is the first address bound to the client's network
adapter. This address is listed first when you look at the Ipconfig, or Winipcfg
command-line tools on the client.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 4.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This limitation of reporting only one TCP/IP per network adapter applies to all
forms of discovery with the exception of Network Discovery using SNMP.

Hotfix Installation Instructions
--------------------------------

Since this is a hotfix to the SMS Client base components, it should be applied to
all primary and secondary sites in the SMS hierarchy. To install the fix, use
the appropriate method.

Method 1: Using the Hotfix Installer:

NOTE: You can use this method only for I386-based computers.

1. Copy the hotfix folder structure to a share on your network. Q270036.exe is a
  Microsoft SMS Installer file that updates specific files on your site server.

2. Log on to your site server using an account with administrative privileges.

3. On the site server, close the SMS Administrator console.

4. Run Q270036.exe and follow the directions in the wizard. You can run the file
  in Quiet mode using the /s switch.

Method 2: Manual Installation:

NOTE: The post SP3 version of the hotfix does not include Abnwcli.dll and
Falclin.dll as these files are included with SMS 2.0 Service Pack 3. Also, some
of the files listed above are contained within CCMCore.exe and Clicore.exe.
Those files are handled automatically and do not need to be manually copied.

1. Create a folder in a location that is accessible to your SMS site servers.

2. Copy the platform folders that contain the hotfixed files to the new folder.

3. From each of the primary and secondary SMS site servers in your environment,
  log on to your site server by using an account with administrative
  privileges.

4. Quit the SMS Administrator console if it is running.

5. Stop all SMS services.

6. Replace the Abnwcli.dll file in the Sms_root_folder\Bin\Platform folder with
  the version obtained from the hotfix.

7. Replace the BindCliN.dll file in the Sms_root_folder\Bin\Platform folder with
  the version obtained from the hotfix.

8. Replace the Falclin.dll file in the Sms_root_folder\Bin\Platform folder with
  the version obtained from the hotfix.

9. Replace the Mslmclin.dll file in the Sms_root_folder\Bin\Platform folder with
  the version obtained from the hotfix.

10. Replace the NdsCliN.dll file in the Sms_root_folder\Bin\Platform folder with
  the version obtained from the hotfix.

11. Replace the Ntsvrdis.dll file in the Sms_root_folder\Bin\Platform folder
  with the version obtained from the hotfix.

12. Replace the Clicore.exe file in the
  Sms_root_folder\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base\Platform folder with the version
  obtained from the hotfix.

13. Replace the Compver.ini file in the Sms_root_folder\Inboxes\Clicomp.src\Base
  folder with the Compverbase.ini file obtained from the hotfix. Note that you
  must rename the Compverbase.ini file to Compver.ini.

14. Restart all SMS services.

NOTE: An NT_Logon_Server_Manager (LSM) polling cycle is necessary to cause the
hotfixed Clicore.exe file to be propagated to all the logon points so that new
clients will be installed by using the hotfixed files. In Systems Management
Server (SMS) 2.0 Service Pack 2 (SP2), LSM was changed so that it does not
perform a polling cycle when the SMS Executive service is stopped and restarted.
For additional information, click the article number below to view the article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base: Q249333 SMS: Logon Server Manager Performs a
Full Work Cycle on Each SMS Executive Restart.
15. Force the Logon Server Manager to perform a polling cycle by creating a file
  named NT_LOGON.NOT in the following folder:
  Sms_root_folder\Inboxes\NT_Logon.box\Notify

All logon points must be updated before you attempt to install new clients.
