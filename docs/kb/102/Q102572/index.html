SUMMARY
=======

The following changes have been made from the Windows 3.1 version of DDEML to
the version that shipped with Windows for Workgroups (WFW) version 3.1:

- The default shutdown timeout was changed from 3,000 milliseconds to 30,000
  milliseconds.

- DdeQueryConvInfo() added support for the new hwnd and hwndPartner fields.

- DdeQueryConvInfo() added more robust handling for improper setting of the
  CONVINFO structure's cb field when called.

- Rewrote DdePostAdvise() to supply the correct count of remaining transactions
  to be processed on the same topic!item!format name set for the XTYP_ADVREQ
  transaction.

- Disallow synchronous calls if the application is shutting down, or if already
  in the middle of a synchronous transaction.

- DdeUninitialize() was fixed to defer processing if called while in the middle
  of a synchronous transaction.

- DdeUninitialize() was fixed to dispatch any pending DDE messages and to make
  necessary callbacks before quitting.

- Added call to DdeUninitialize() from within DdeClientTransaction() when in
  the middle of a synchronous transaction and DdeUninitialize() had been
  called.

- Allow any instance to call DdeCreateStringHandle().

- Have DdeAbandonTransaction() only mark abandoned transactions, rather than
  trying to remove the transaction from internal structures.

- Alter PostMessage() overflow queuing to queue based on target instead of on
  the same task, so that one target queue overflow does not bog down all
  PostMessage() calls.
