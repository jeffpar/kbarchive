- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

If a Windows NT Advanced Server running Services for the Macintosh requires that
the Macintosh computers use the Microsoft User Authentication Module (UAM), then
the Microsoft UAM may need to be protected from user activity, such as throwing
the MS UAM away.

See below for procedures that you can use to protect the MS UAM.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To protect the MS UAM, do at least one of the following two procedures. Note
that both of these procedures are performed on the Macintosh workstation,
because that is where the MS UAM resides.

Procedure 1
-----------

Make the AppleShare folder in the Macintosh's System Folder invisible. This keeps
the Finder from displaying the folder, making it unlikely to be erased on
accident. Hiding the folder requires using ResEdit or a similar utility.

Procedure 2
-----------

Lock the MS UAM file in the AppleShare folder. This helps to keep the file from
being thrown away by presenting the user with a warning first. To lock the MS
UAM:

1. Go to the Finder and select the MS UAM file in the AppleShare Folder.

2. From the File menu, choose Get Info.

3. Select the Locked check box in the bottom of the Get Info window, and close
  the window.

The best protection for the MS UAM is to use both of the actions described above.
This hides the MS UAM and makes it more difficult to throw away by accident.

NOTE: The actions in this article are designed to offer protection from casual
users. More experienced users will still be able to remove the MS UAM if they
want to.

ResEdit is manufactured by a vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no
warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's performance or
reliability.
