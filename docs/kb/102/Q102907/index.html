SUMMARY
=======

This article contains a checklist of potential problems with local logon
scripts. A logon script is similar to a batch file because it performs a series
of commands when a user logs in to his or her account.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If problems arise with a logon scripts, use the following list to troubleshoot
the problem:

- Make sure the logon script is in the following directory:

  \winnt\system32\repl\import\scripts

  The only valid path option is a subdirectory of the default logon script
  directory. A path to any other directory or using the environment variable
  %HOMEPATH% will cause the logon script to fail.

- If the file system on the partition containing the logon script directory is
  NTFS, make sure the user has read rights to the logon script directory. If no
  rights have been explicitly assigned, the logon script may fail without
  providing an error message.

- Make sure the logon script has a filename extension of either "CMD" or "BAT."
  A script with any other extension will fail. The "EXE" extension is also
  supported, but only for genuine executable programs.

  Attempting to use the .EXE extension for a script file will result in the
  following error message:

  NTVDM CPU has encountered an illegal instruction.

  To remove the error, terminate the application or the virtual MS-DOS machine
  (VDM).

- If the logon script is to be set up for a Windows for Workgroups computer,
  the Windows for Workgroups computer must have the Windows NT domain specified
  in the LAN Manager domain portion of Control Panel networks, rather than just
  assigned to that workgroup.

- It will take a period of time for a recently created logon script to be
  replicated from the Primary Domain Controller to all the member servers.
  Thus, if a workstation is validated by a server other than the Primary Domain
  Controller, recently created logon script changes may not be in effect.

- Use Server Manager to view a list of Backup Domain Controller in the domain.
  On EVERY Backup Domain Controller in the domain, verify that replication is
  enabled and that the netlogon share contains current logon scripts.
