-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you start your Windows NT-based computer, you may receive the following
error message:

  Windows NT could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt:

  \%winnt%\SYSTEM32\CONFIG\SYSTEMHardware Profile/Last Known Good menu

CAUSE
=====

The System subkey of the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive in the registry is too large to
fit into the allocated memory space. Often, this part of the registry is too
large because services store a lot of information in their Parameters keys under
the CurrentControlSet\Services key. The following services are known to store
large amounts of data under this key under certain conditions:

- Spooler (number of printers)
- DHCP (number of reservations)
- AT Scheduler (number of jobs)
- DFS (number of shares)
- Other and third-party services


RESOLUTION
==========


The only resolution is to use an Emergency Repair Disk (ERD), or perform a
reinstallation of Windows NT.

After you have recovered the system from a backup or an ERD, you can either
reduce the amount of data stored by a service or install the hotfix for the
spooler service.

Windows NT Server or Workstation 4.0
------------------------------------

STATUS
======

Windows NT Server or Workstation 4.0
------------------------------------

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.

Windows NT 3.5, 3.51
--------------------

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This issue may occur when something is writing too much data to the System
subkey in the registry. The System subkey is designed exclusively for
information that is necessary to boot the computer.

Intel and ARC (RISC) systems have a design limit such that 16 MB of memory is
available at this stage of the boot process. The System registry file has to
share the 16 MB with the loader, kernel, HAL, and boot drivers. In some
instances, the System subkey may be as large as 13 MB in size (or larger).
