If the memory models are incorrectly mixed within the QuickC Version
2.00 environment (i.e., the compilation is done in small model, and
the resulting .OBJ is linked to MLIBCE.LIB), the program appears to
compile and link correctly. However, when QuickC tries to run the
file, the program name echoes, the screen flickers, and you are
returned to the QuickC Version 2.00 environment where an error-message
dialog box says "Cannot find current location in source file."

If the same make file is run outside of the QuickC environment, the
program compiles, links, and runs successfully, as the linker uses the
default library for the memory model that was used to compile.
However, if a library for another memory model is explicitly added to
the link line, for example, if the following line is executed,

   qcl /AS test.c /link mlibce.lib

it will compile and link with no errors, and the resulting .EXE file,
free from the error-recovery abilities of the QuickC environment,
hangs the computer.

This frequently happens with programs that are being ported from
QuickC Version 1.01 to QuickC Version 2.00 because they are built with
existing make files that specify the external library MLIBCE.LIB or
MLIBC7.LIB explicitly. However, the default for the QuickC Version
2.00 integrated environment is small model, and not medium, as was the
case with QuickC Version 1.00 and Version 1.01.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Version 2.00. We are
researching this problem and will post new information as it becomes
available.
