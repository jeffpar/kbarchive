The following information is taken from the QuickC Version 2.00
README.DOC file, part 3, "Notes on 'QuickC Tool Kit.'" The following
notes refer to specific pages in "QuickC Tool Kit."

Page 174   Differences between NMAKE and MAKE

Note: If you don't own QuickC Version 1, skip this section.

Section 7.5 explains how to convert DOS MAKE files for use with NMAKE.
Section 7.6 explains how to interchange QuickC 2.0 Program Lists (.MAK
files) with NMAKE description files. The discussion below covers
conversion of QuickC Version 1 program lists to NMAKE files.

It's fastest and easiest to delete the old .MAK files and create new
ones from within QuickC. However, if you wish to alter a Version 1
program list by hand, follow these instructions:

Converting to NMAKE Format

To use QuickC 1.00 and 1.01 program lists (.MAK files) with the
stand-alone NMAKE utility, follow these steps:

1. Make a backup copy of the .MAK file.

2. Delete or comment out (precede with a #) the first two lines of
   the .MAK file. These lines define inference rules.

3. Add the following as the first target in the file:

      all : target.exe

(Replace "target.exe" with the name of the final target in the file.)
Spell the target name with lowercase characters only.

4. Change the initial capital letter of the final target in the file
   to a lowercase letter.

Converting to 2.0 Format

If you want to use the resulting file within the QuickC 2.0
environment, you must also follow these steps:

1. Run QuickC.

2. Choose Set Program List from the Make menu. Specify the .MAK file
   you just edited as the program list file.

3. Choose Edit Program List from the Make menu and immediately choose
   &lt;Save List&gt;.
