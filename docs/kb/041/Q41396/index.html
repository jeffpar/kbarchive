In the QB.EXE editor in QuickBASIC Versions 4.00, 4.00b, and 4.50, if
the syntax of the parameter list in a SUB or FUNCTION statement is
incorrect and the ENTER key is used to move to the next line, the
following misleading error message is displayed:

   "Blank lines not allowed before SUB/FUNCTION line. Is Remark OK?"

If you select the "OK" option, a remark (') line is inserted AFTER the
SUB or FUNCTION line, and the correct error message is then displayed.
The message may differ based on what the actual error is.

If you use the Mouse or ARROW keys (instead of the ENTER key) to move
to the next line, the correct error message will then display. (You
will not receive the incorrect error message, and a remark line will
not be inserted after the SUB or FUNCTION line.)

Microsoft is researching the initially misleading error message and
will post new information as it becomes available.

When using the ENTER key to move to the next line, the QuickBASIC
Environment will not allow you to leave the SUB/FUNCTION line until
the syntax error has been corrected. However, you can move to another
line using the Mouse or ARROW keys without correcting the error.

Moving to another line without correcting the error in a SUB or
FUNCTION line is not a good idea. Various editing steps within the
same window following this can cause unexpected results. The following
example will hang the machine:

1. Type in the following program:

        CALL test(X)
        SUB test(X)
          PRINT
        END SUB

   (The Subprogram is displayed in its own window.)

2. Edit the SUB statement so that it is incorrect (e.g. by deleting
   the right parenthesis):

        SUB test(X

3. Press the ENTER key to produce the events described above.

4. Attempt to enter another SUB or FUNCTION statement following
   the END SUB statement.

5. You will receive one or two incorrect error messages as described
   previously.

6. You will then receive one or two correct messages:

     "END SUB or END FUNCTION must be last statement in window"

7. If you ignore the messages and enter the SUB or FUNCTION statement,
   the machine will hang, possibly requiring a cold boot.
