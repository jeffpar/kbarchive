The program below declares six different character type variables.
Watching each variable in QuickC Version 2.00 as a string might not
have the desired effect.

Watching any of the three arrays with explicit sizes displays all
eight elements as an array of characters, as follows:

   array1 : { 'A', 'r', 'r', 'a', 'y', '1', '\0', '\0' }

Watching either of the two arrays with implicit sizes reveals a
problem with QuickC Version 2.00: nothing is displayed between the
curly braces. The following is an example:

   array4 : {  }

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Version 2.00. We are
researching this problem and will post new information as it becomes
available.

Watching the pointer displays the contents of array1 as follows (as
expected):

   pointer : "Array1"

Watching any of the arrays with an "s" formatter also gives results
that probably are unwanted. The arrays with explicit sizes show eight
different strings; strings that are pointed to by the character
elements of the array. The array with implicit sizes again shows an
empty set of braces.

Watching the pointer with an "s" gives the expected results, as
follows:

   pointer,s : "Array1"

All six variables can be watched as strings, and not as arrays of
characters, with the following watch format:

   &amp;array1[0],s : "Array1"

The first element of any of the variables is a character, the address
of which is a character pointer. This pointer can then be cast to a
string.

The following sample program is an example of watching string
variables in QuickC Version 2.00:

#include &lt;string.h&gt;

char array1[8];
char array2[8] =  "Array2";
char array3[8] = {'A', 'r', 'r', 'a', 'y', '3', '\0'};
char array4[]  =  "Array4";
char array5[]  = {'A', 'r', 'r', 'a', 'y', '5', '\0'};

char *pointer  = array1;

void main( void )
{
    strcpy( array1, "Array1" );
}
