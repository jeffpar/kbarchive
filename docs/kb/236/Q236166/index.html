SUMMARY
=======

When you make changes to the registry that affect IIS and its dependent
services, you must stop and restart those services in order to force them to
re-read the registry.

As an alternative to stopping and starting those services using the Services
applet in Control Panel, you can use the NET STOP and NET START commands.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Stopping IISADMIN and its dependent services:

To stop all IIS-related services, type "NET STOP IISADMIN /Y" (without the
quotation marks) at a command prompt. This will stop the IIS Admin Service and
all dependent services. Below is an example of the output you will see after
issuing this command (the dependent services listed on your computer may vary):

  

  The following services are dependent on the IIS Admin Service service.
  Stopping the IIS Admin Service service will also stop these services.

  FTP Publishing Service
  Microsoft NNTP Service
  Microsoft SMTP Service
  World Wide Web Publishing Service

You will then see a message displayed as each service is successfully stopped.

Starting the IIS-related services:

Use the NET START command to restart the IIS-related services you use. For
example, to restart the World Wide Web service, type "NET START W3SVC" (without
the quotation marks).

Determining service names:

To determine the service names, start Registry Editor (type Regedit.exe or
Regedt32.exe) and go to the following registry key:

  
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services

Under Services, the service name that works with the NET STOP and NET START
commands is listed.

NOTE: For each service, there is also a DisplayName value, which is the name
listed in the Services applet in Control Panel and in the messages displayed
after the NET STOP and NET START commands are run. However, these Display Names
cannot be used as a parameter with the NET STOP and NET START commands.

Common IIS-related services:

+--------------------------------------------------+
| Service Name | Display Name                      | 
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Iisadmin     | IIS Admin Service                 | 
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Msftpsvc     | FTP Publishing Service            | 
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Nntpsvc      | Microsoft NNTP Service            | 
+--------------------------------------------------+
| Smtpsvc      | Microsoft SMTP Service            | 
+--------------------------------------------------+
| W3svc        | World Wide Web Publishing Service | 
+--------------------------------------------------+
