SYMPTOMS
========

Systems Management Server 2.0 client component installation may fail after
applying Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack 1 if all of the following
conditions are true:

- Multiple Systems Management Server 2.0 sites share the same Windows NT
  domain.

- At least one of the sites in this hierarchy has been upgraded.

- The client being installed belongs to a site that has not been upgraded yet.

Looking at the %Windir%\Ms\Sms\Logs\Ccim32.log file on the client, you may see
entries similar to the following:

CAUSE
=====

The issue can occur when the service pack has not been applied to all the sites
that share a given set of logon points (that is, all domain controllers within a
Windows NT domain). Installation of the service pack updates the files for the
base components on all logon points for the site. This means that clients that
get the base components from the logon point will be running the Service Pack 1
version of the base components. When the client then attaches to the client
access point (CAP) server to install the optional components, there is a version
mismatch and the optional components are not installed.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Systems Management
Server version 2.0. For additional information, please see the following article
in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q236325 How to Obtain the Latest Systems Management Server 2.0 Service Pack

WORKAROUND
==========

To avoid this problem, try either of the following:

- Ensure that all sites sharing the logon points are upgraded simultaneously.

  -or-

- Disable logon discovery and installation for affected sites.

In a situation where one of the sites has already been updated but the others
have not, another option is to upgrade the remaining sites to Systems Management
Server 2.0 Service Pack 1.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
version 2.0. This problem was first corrected in Systems Management Server
version 2.0 Service Pack 2.

MORE INFORMATION
================

This issue only affects clients for sites that have not been upgraded, because
the base components that the clients get from the logon point are not
synchronized with the CAP(s) for the site.

Although this issue does not cause an error condition on clients, it does prevent
the client from having full functionality. Microsoft recommends that you upgrade
all sites that share logon points as closely together as possible, to avoid
experiencing this issue.

The upgrade process is:

1. If the Client Configuration Installation Manager (CCIM) wakes up before the
  client logs on again, the upgrade will occur solely from the CAP. Thus,
  clients who belong to a site that has been upgraded and therefore are meant
  to receive the upgrade will run Clicore from their upgraded CAP. Clients that
  belong to a site that has not yet been upgraded (and therefore are not meant
  to be upgraded) will not in this instance.

2. If the client logs on before the next CCIM wakeup cycle and Windows NT Client
  Logon Discovery/Installation is enabled, the Clicore on the logon point will
  run, updating part of the base components (that is, the parts needed by Logon
  Discovery and Installation). CCIM will finish the base installation at its
  next wakeup cycle.
