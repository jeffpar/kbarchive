The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition

SYMPTOMS
========

Before the release of DirectPlay 6.1a on Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6,
DirectPlay on Windows NT 4.0 had too many race conditions (one process assuming
the other process has stopped responding or is still responding when the
opposite is true), blocked joins, and unexpected disconnects to be considered a
reliable protocol for networked games.

The following are difficulties experienced with networked (multiplayer) games on
DirectPlay with Windows NT 4.0 before the release of DirectPlay 6.1a:

- A player cannot join a game that is in session.

- A player's connection to the game quits unexpectedly.

- A player with a serial or modem connection cannot maintain a session for an
  extended period of time.

- A player's gaming screen freezes during a joint session scenario.

- Certain players in the game cannot move while others are moving.

- The players cannot tell when another player has left the game.

- When multiple players leave a game, DirectPlay shuts down itself and the
  game.

- When the designated host tries to quit a peer-to-peer session, the game
  crashes and the host's migration does not work.

- During a guaranteed send (typically because a player unexpectedly quits the
  game), a large timeout delay occurs.

RESOLUTION
==========

DirectPlay 6.1a is available in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6 and later. To
resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or the
individual software update. For information on obtaining the latest service
pack, please go to:

Services phone numbers and information on support costs, please go to the

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products that are
listed at the beginning of this article. This problem was first corrected in
Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Typically, the design of networked (multiplayer) games accommodates Windows NT
4.0 as well as Windows 9x platforms. It is not uncommon for Windows NT to serve
as a host or server in client-server games or as a lobby platform. Many games
were developed to work on Windows NT; thus these games can also participate in
peer-to-peer sessions with a peer-designated host. Windows NT 4.0 is a
reasonably common development platform for multiplayer features in games.

DirectPlay is the part of DirectX that interfaces between programs and
communication services (Internet, modem link, network) to allow game players to
find game sessions and sites and manage the flow of information between hosts
and players, regardless of the underlying online service or protocol. Microsoft
DirectX is a group of technologies designed to enhance running programs with
numerous multimedia elements (graphics, video, 3-D animation, surround sound);
it is built directly into Microsoft's operating systems. For example, Windows NT
4.0 contains the DirectX 2.0 release of Microsoft DirectDraw, Microsoft
DirectSound, and Microsoft DirectPlay, and it supports DirectX 3.0 functionality
with the addition of Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.

The successful implementation of DirectPlay 6.1a has involved changes to the
following files for Windows NT 4.0 SP6:

- dPlay

- dplaypr

- paketize

- api

- apphack

- dxdiag

- comport

- dpmodemx

- pdb

- sym

Even though DirectPlay 6.1a is released in Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 6, the
DirectPlay 6.1a files can be installed on any computer running Windows NT 4.0
Service Pack 3 or later.
