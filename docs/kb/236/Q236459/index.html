-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

Novell GroupWise users may find that when they accept meeting requests from
Exchange Server users, their meeting times are an hour later than the original
meeting time. This behavior occurs during the time period between October 27th
to October 31st. Note that October 31st is the end of Daylight Savings Time
(DST) when most parts of the world automatically advance an hour.

CAUSE
=====

In the GroupWise API gateway, the end of DST is incorrectly set at October 27th,
rather than October 31st. This results in all meeting requests sent from
Exchange Server to GroupWise to automatically advance an hour.

RESOLUTION
==========
