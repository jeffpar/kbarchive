STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition.

This problem was first corrected in Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 6 and
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition Service Pack 6.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To prevent the improper shutdown event entry from being written to the Event
Viewer system log:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following registry key:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Reliability\LastAliveStamp

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

  Value name: TimeStampInterval
  Data type: REG_DWORD
  Value: The number, in minutes, between time stamp events written to the log.
  Setting the value to 0 prevents the "last alive" time stamp from being
  logged. Only boot and normal shutdown events are then written to the log
  file.

4. Quit Registry Editor.
