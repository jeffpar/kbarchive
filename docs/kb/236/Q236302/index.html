SYMPTOMS
========

When you uninstall Procomm Plus 32 and restart your computer, you may receive
the following error message, and your computer is unable to complete the boot
process:

  STOP: 0xC0000143 Missing System File The required system file
  Display_driver.dll is bad or missing.

CAUSE
=====

This error message can occur if you installed Procomm Plus 4.7 with Remote Relay
as an installed component. Remote Relay renames your original display adapter
driver to Rrctrl&lt;x&gt;.dll, where &lt;x&gt; is a number from 1 to 6. The
uninstall procedure may remove the Rrctrl&lt;x.dll&gt; files, but does not
change the registry entry, resulting in the error message.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, reinstall your video display adapter driver. To do so,
first attempt to restart your computer in VGA mode.

If You Can Restart into VGA Mode
--------------------------------

1. Place your Windows NT CD in your CD-ROM drive.

2. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

3. Click the Settings tab, click Display Type, and then click Change.

4. If you installed a display drive that came with Windows NT, select the
  Manufacturer and Model for your display adapter, and then click OK. If you
  used a third-party display driver, click Have Disk, navigate to the location
  for your Windows NT 4.0 drivers, and then click OK.
  NOTE: Some third-party display drivers are designed to use their own Setup.exe
  file to install their drivers. Check the documentation that came with the
  display driver if using Have Disk does not allow you to install the driver
  successfully.

5. Restart your computer and adjust your display settings as necessary.

6. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

7. Type rrctrl , and then click Find Now. Note that you may not have any of
  these files, or you may have several files.

8. Rename each of these files.

If You Cannot Restart into VGA Mode
-----------------------------------

1. Install Windows NT into another folder. It is preferred that you install
  Windows NT into a different drive, if possible. This is known as a parallel
  installation.

2. Upgrade the parallel installation to the same Service Pack level as the
  original installation of Windows NT.

3. Install the same video driver in the parallel installation that you used to
  install in the original Windows NT installation.

4. Navigate to the the following folder in the parallel installation, and look
  for the display driver system (.Sys) file:

  &lt;Winntpar&gt;\System32\Drivers

  where &lt;winntpar&gt; is the name of the Windows NT folder that contains the
  parallel installation.

5. Click Start, point to Programs, and then click Command Prompt.

6. Type each of the following lines, pressing the ENTER key after each line:

  cd &lt;winntpar&gt;\system32\drivers
  copy &lt;driver.sys&gt;&lt;winnt&gt;\system32\rrctrl1.dll
  copy &lt;driver.sys&gt;&lt;winnt&gt;\system32\rrctrl2.dll
  copy &lt;driver.sys&gt;&lt;winnt&gt;\system32\rrctrl3.dll
  copy &lt;driver.sys&gt;&lt;winnt&gt;\system32\rrctrl4.dll
  copy &lt;driver.sys&gt;&lt;winnt&gt;\system32\rrctrl5.dll
  copy &lt;driver.sys&gt;&lt;winnt&gt;\system32\rrctrl6.dll

  where &lt;winntpar&gt; is the name of the Windows NT folder for the parallel
  installation, &lt;winnt&gt; is the name of the original Windows NT folder,
  and &lt;driver.sys&gt; is the name of the display driver .Sys file.

  This step copies the display driver to the files that the entries for Remote
  Relay have set in the registry for display.

7. Restart your original installation of Windows NT in VGA mode, and then follow
  the steps in the "Can Restart into VGA mode" section of this article.
