-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

An Exchange Server directory replication bridgehead server may:

- Stop processing the Inbox in the information store, which can potentially
  result in a backlog of messages in the Directory service's Inbox.

- Stop responding to partner bridgehead servers' requests for replica updates.

Additionally, the following event may appear in the application event log.

NOTE: Before 1171 events can be logged, the Directory service Internal Processing
logging level must be set to Minimum.

  Event ID: 1171
  Source: MSExchangeDS
  Description: Exception e0010002 has occurred with parameters 9 and 9 (internal
  ID 3050444). Contact Microsoft Technical Support for assistance.

Later, perhaps numerous times over several hours, the following event messages
may be logged in the application event log:

  Event ID: 1105
  Description: The internal directory replication agent (DRA) Dispatcher thread
  did not execute. If this message is logged more than 5 times, restart the
  directory.

  Event ID: 1106
  Description: The directory replication agent (DRA) has been trying to connect
  to the mail service for more than 10 minutes. Make sure the mail service is
  running.

CAUSE
=====

This issue can occur for several reasons. Most importantly, the 1105 and 1106
errors are an indication that the directory service has not logged on to the
mailbox in the information store for a period of time. The 1105 and 1106 events
may be logged simply because the Information Store service is not running.

The key indicators for the issue that is documented in this article are the 1171
event specifics.

The Directory service performs similarly to most other MAPI clients when the
Directory service processes the Inbox and submits replication messages to target
other replication bridgehead servers. The MAPI portion of the Directory service
initializes approximately five minutes after Directory service initialization
(assuming that the Information Store service and Message Transfer Agent (MTA)
service start after the Directory service).

Typically, this 1171 event message is logged 20 to 60 minutes before the 1105 and
1106 event messages are logged. This particular error message is more likely to
occur on multi-processor computers.


RESOLUTION
==========

Microsoft has modified the default behavior of the directory service to prevent
the preceding symptoms from occurring. This feature is available in the latest
service pack for Exchange Server version 5.5. For additional information, please
see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack



WORKAROUND
==========

To temporarily work around this issue, restart the Directory service.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
5.5.This feature was first included in Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack 4.
