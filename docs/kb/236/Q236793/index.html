IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SUMMARY
=======

This article discusses how to deploy Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.01 Service
Packs with the Outlook Deployment Kit (ODK) for Outlook 98.

You should test this method thoroughly in a non-production, test environment
prior to deployment to production systems.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By default, the ODK includes the files necessary to install Internet Explorer
4.01. In some cases it may be desirable to deploy Outlook, and the latest
Service Pack (currently SP2), for Internet Explorer 4.01, in a single package.
It is not possible to deploy Internet Explorer 5.0 with the ODK.

NOTE: Microsoft highly recommends installing Outlook 98 and Internet Explorer
4.01 with the ODK, and then installing the latest version or Service Pack for
Internet Explorer separately.

To install Internet Explorer 4.01 SP2 within the ODK installation:

1. After installing the ODK, back up the \Program Files\ODK\Download\En folder.

2. Copy the Internet Explorer 4.01 Service Pack files to the \Program
  Files\ODK\Download\En folder. There are 123 files for SP2, which include both
  Microsoft Windows 9x and Microsoft Windows NT setup files. These files can be
  obtained from various sources, such as the Microsoft Internet Explorer
  Administration Kit (IEAK) or the Microsoft Developer Support Network (MSDN)
  CDs.

3. Delete the Mschat2.cab file. This file will be replaced by Mschat21.cab.

4. Replace the Outlook.cif file with the updated Outlook.cif file. To obtain the
  file, see the "References section.

5. Start the Outlook Deployment Wizard (ODW) and create an Outlook installation
  package.

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To Modify the Registry
----------------------

Before deploying the package, modify the registry on each workstation by
resetting the IsInstalled value for each component being upgraded. This can be
done with a batch job run via a logon script or SMS package. You can also
perform these steps manually:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the subkey for each component you wish to update under the following
  key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Active Setup\Installed Components

3. Set the IsInstalled value to 00000000 (DWORD values), or to 00,00,00,00 (for
  BINARY values), for each of the components.

4. Quit Registry Editor.
