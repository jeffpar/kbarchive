The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

During Microsoft Windows for Workgroups Setup, the Workgroups Mail, and
Schedule+ component files (FRAMEWRK.DLL, MSSFS.DLL, and MAILSPL.EXE) are
installed even if the Mail and Schedule+ programs are not.

MORE INFORMATION
================

During installation of Windows for Workgroups 3.11, you can choose the Custom
Install option. With this option, you can elect not to install certain
components of Windows for Workgroups, including Mail and Schedule+. If you chose
not to install these two programs, certain Mail files are still installed:

- AB.DLL is a Address Book user interface support function.

- DEMILAYR.DLL is a Microsoft Work Group Add-On system services layer.

- FRAMEWRK.DLL is the Workgroup Applications framework layer.

- MAILMGR.DLL provides Mail Manager API support functions.

- MAILSPL.EXE is the program in Workgroups Mail that spools messages from the
  Outbox to the Postoffice and checks for new messages, which it places in the
  Inbox.

- MSSFS.DLL is the Workgroup Mail Shared File System Transport Provider and is
  used to send and receive messages to and from the Postoffice database.

- SENDFILE.DLL is a File Manager extension that allows a file to be sent as an
  attachment.

- STORE.DLL provides message store support functions.

- VFORMS.DLL provides Mail viewed forms.

- VPMTD.386 is the At Work PC Fax scheduler virtual device driver (VxD). This
  VxD is loaded from a DEVICE= line in the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI
  file.

These files are considered Windows dynamic link libraries (DLLs) that other
applications depend on and therefore are installed regardless of whether Mail
and Schedule+ are installed.
