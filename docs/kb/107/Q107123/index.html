-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The README.TXT file of C.8 for SNA Server 2.0 states that SNA Server device
drivers (such as the IBM SDLC driver) should not be removed with the
Network portion of Control Panel. Doing so may result in unexpected
behavior, for which the only known solution is to remove and reinstall SNA
Server. Instead, use SNA Server Setup to remove the component.

NOTE: The Readme files for SNA Server versions later than version 2.0 do not include this information. However, the removal of SNA Server Link Services using Control Panel is not supported.

If you accidentally delete any of the link services, the services
themselves do not stop until the SNA Server is stopped. At that time, a
warning is displayed that the link service has been deleted. 3270 Clients
receive Error 2574. The event log shows that there was no link service
available to start a service.

You cannot restore SNA Server by restarting SNA Server or by rebooting
Windows NT and choosing the last known good configuration.

The workaround is either a full removal and reinstallation, or using the
following procedure:

1. From SNA Server Setup, configure a link service.

  NOTE: SNA Server link services are added and removed using SNA Server Manager
  for SNA Server versions 3.0 and 4.0.

2. Select the service that no longer has a link service defined.

3. Double-click this selection to bring up the connection properties.

4. Choose the link service arrow and select the required link service needed for
  the link.

  The link service should report (none).

5. Choose the link service, and then choose OK.

6. Restart the service.

NOTE: If this procedure fails, a reinstallation must be performed.
