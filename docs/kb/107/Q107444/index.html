The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for Windows, version 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft provides a replacement for the SETUP.EXE and SETUP.INF files included
in version 3.2a of Microsoft Mail for Windows.

The information below outlines procedures for users to run Mail for Windows from
the network without storing Mail files on their local workstations.

For complete information about obtaining the SETUP.EXE and SETUP.INF files, see
the "To download the updated file" section below.

The network administrator can use the outlined procedures to set up version 3.2a
of Microsoft Mail so users can run Mail for Windows from the network without
storing Mail files on their local workstations.

- "Running Windows and Mail from the Network--Same Directory" explains how to
  set up Mail for Windows when users run both Microsoft Windows and version
  3.2a of Mail for Windows from the same network directory.

- "Running Windows and Mail from the Network--Different Directories" explains
  how to set up Mail for Windows when users run both Windows and Mail for
  Windows from different network directories.

- "Running Windows Locally and Mail from the Network" explains how to set up
  Mail for Windows when users run Windows locally and run Mail for Windows from
  the network.

- "Running Windows from the Network and Mail Locally" explains how to set up
  Mail for Windows when users run Windows from the network and run Mail for
  Windows locally.

  Notes:

  To use Advanced Security (MAIL.DAT) in a shared Windows environment, two files
  must be updated: the SETUP.EXE file (included in this update) and MSSFS.DLL
  version 3.2.0.4079 (included in MSSFS.EXE on the Microsoft Software Library
  (MSL)).

  Because the file I/O that normally occurs on the local workstation is being
  handled by the network, Mail's performance may decrease if you run Mail for
  Windows from the network.

Running Windows and Mail from the Network--Same Directory
---------------------------------------------------------

Definitions
-----------

- &lt;MAILDATA&gt; refers to the directory containing the Mail database.

- &lt;MAILEXE&gt; refers to the directory containing the Mail executable files.

- &lt;WINSHARE&gt; refers to the shared location of the network installation of
  Windows.

- &lt;MYDIR&gt; refers to the user's Windows directory on the file server
  (where the user's .INI and .GRP files are located).

Installation Steps
------------------

To set up the Mail 3.2a shared files

1. Install Windows in a server directory (&lt;WINSHARE&gt;) and designate a
  drive letter for the directory. Set full rights for Supervisor, ReadOnly, and
  FileScan (for Novell networks) for all users.

2. Install the Mail postoffice in the &lt;MAILDATA&gt; and &lt;MAILEXE&gt;
  directories as described on pages 6-10 in the Microsoft Mail 3.2
  "Administrator's Guide." Designate drive letters for each directory.

3. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

  " copy &lt;drive&gt;:\setup.* &lt;destination&gt; " (without the quotation
  marks)

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive and directory where you ran the self-
  extracting SETUPD.EXE file and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory
  where your SETUP.EXE and SETUP.INF files currently reside. For example, if
  you ran the self-extracting file from the TEST directory on drive D, and the
  SETUP.EXE and SETUP.INF files are located in the MAILEXE directory on drive
  C, type the following command:

  " copy d:\test\setup.* c:\mailexe " (without the quotation marks)

4. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

  " copy &lt;mailexe&gt;\setup.inf &lt;mailexe&gt;\setupinf.old " (without the
  quotation marks)

  where &lt;mailexe&gt; is the complete path to the directory containing the
  Microsoft Mail for Windows SETUP.EXE program. For example, if SETUP.EXE is
  located in the MAILEXE directory on drive C, type the following command:

  " copy c:\mailexe\setup.inf c:\mailexe\setupinf.old " (without the quotation
  marks)

5. Using any text editor, edit the SETUP.INF file. In the [Setup] section,
  replace the following line

  1, setup.exe,,,, 1993-03-09, !DECOMPRESS,, OLDER, !READONLY,,,,,, 62608,,,,
  3.2.0.4027,

  with:

  1, setup.exe,,,, 1994-01-11, !DECOMPRESS,, OLDER, !READONLY,,,,,, 62880,,,,
  3.2.0.4076,

  Save the file and close the text editor.

  NOTE: For these changes to affect the entire network, each existing user must
  run Setup again.

6. Log on to the network as Supervisor and run Windows from the &lt;WINSHARE&gt;
  directory. In Windows File Manager, go to the &lt;MAILEXE&gt; directory and
  start the Setup program by double-clicking the SETUP.EXE file. When the Setup
  program prompts you for the Microsoft Mail directory, type WINSHARE as the
  location. For example, if the network version of Windows is located in the
  WIN31 directory on drive X, type X:\WIN31. This will install all the Mail
  program files in the same directory as Windows.

To set up a user for Mail 3.2a

1. Install Windows to &lt;MYDIR&gt; on the server using the following command:

  setup /n

2. Run Windows from &lt;MYDIR&gt;. In Windows File Manager, go to the
  &lt;MAILEXE&gt; directory and start the Setup program by double-clicking the
  SETUP.EXE file. When the Setup program prompts you for the Microsoft Mail
  directory, type WINSHARE as the location. For example, if the network version
  of Windows is located in the WIN31 directory on drive X, type X:\WIN31. This
  will install Mail in the Windows shared directory on the server and create an
  MSMAIL directory in the &lt;MYDIR&gt; directory on the server containing the
  user's .INI files.

  " copy &lt;drive&gt;:\setup.* &lt;destination&gt; " (without the quotation
  marks)

  where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive and directory where you ran the self-
  extracting SETUPD.EXE file and &lt;destination&gt; is the drive and directory
  where your SETUP.EXE and SETUP.INF files currently reside. For example, if
  you ran the self-extracting file from the TEST directory on drive D, and the
  SETUP.EXE and SETUP.INF files are located in the MAILEXE directory on drive
  C, type the following command:

  " copy d:\test\setup.* c:\mailexe " (without the quotation marks)

  3.2.0.4027,

  with:

  1, setup.exe,,,, 1994-07-22, !DECOMPRESS,, OLDER, !READONLY,,,,,, 62880,,,,

  In the [MsMail Prog] and the [Msmail System] sections, change the word Older
  to Never.

  Save the file and close the text editor.

  NOTE: For these changes to affect the entire network, each existing user must
  run Setup again.

6. Log on to the network as Supervisor and run Windows from the &lt;WINSHARE&gt;
  directory. In Windows File Manager, go to the &lt;MAILEXE&gt; directory and
  start the Setup program by double-clicking the SETUP.EXE file. When the Setup
  program prompts you for the Microsoft Mail directory, type MAIL32 as the
  location. For example, if the network version of Mail is located in the
  MAIL32 directory on drive X, type X:\MAIL32.

To set up a user for Mail 3.2a command:

1. Install Windows to &lt;MYDIR&gt; on the server using the following setup /n

2. Run Windows from &lt;MYDIR&gt;. In Windows File Manager, go to the
  &lt;MAILEXE&gt; directory and start the Setup program by double-clicking the
  SETUP.EXE file. When the Setup program prompts you for the Microsoft Mail
  directory, type MAIL32 as the location. For example, if the network version
  of Mail is located in the MAIL32 directory on drive X, type X:\MAIL32. This
  will create an MSMAIL directory in the &lt;MYDIR&gt; directory on the server
  containing the user's .INI files.
