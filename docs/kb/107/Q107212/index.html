SYMPTOMS
========

You may encounter several printing problems when you print from Encarta to the
Hewlett Packard PaintJet XL300 printer. All colored graphics and images print in
black and white. Also, many extended characters print incorrectly.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Encarta, 1994 edition. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

NOTE: This is a known problem with all Viewer/MediaView applications.

RESOLUTION
==========

As a workaround, you can copy color graphics from Encarta to other Windows
applications (such as Word or Works) and then print them from there.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Other printing problems include the following:

- Because color is missing from the color graphics, images from the Atlas print
  only with country names, borders, and mountains. Rivers and topographical
  information is missing.

- Climate charts do not include graph bars when you print using the black and
  white option.

- Jump links do not print in color.

Extended characters that print incorrectly on the PaintJet XL300 include the
following:

- Curly quotation marks print as checkerboard characters.

- Subscript and superscript characters print as normal characters.

- Small caps print as normal lower case text.

- The degree character prints as a checkerboard character.

- The em-dash prints as a checkerboard character.

- The Egyptian hieroglyph of the letter "E" prints as an E with an umlaut on
  top.

- The ellipse prints as a checkerboard character.

- The graphic of an equal sign (in which the top line is an arrow pointing to
  the right and the bottom line is an arrow pointing to the left) prints as a
  plus sign.

- The inverted omega character prints as a checkerboard character.
