The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft SNA Server, versions 2.0, 2.1, 2.11, 2.11 SP1, 2.11 SP2, 3.0, 3.0 SP1, 3.0 SP2, 3.0 SP3, 4.0

SUMMARY
=======

The IBM SDLC, MPCA and Token Ring adapters may cause interrupt or shared memory
conflicts.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following information appears in the SNA Server Administration Guide.

NOTE: This information was also included in the README.TXT for early SNA Server
2.x versions.

Device drivers provided by SNA Server report any interrupt, port address, or DMA
conflicts they detect to the Windows NT System Event log.

If you are using an IBM SDLC or MPCA card in an ISA or EISA bus system, you
should do the following:

- Disable SERIAL.SYS (which is enabled by default) to prevent an interrupt
  conflict. To do this, use the Devices option in the Windows NT Control Panel.

- Disable any COM ports that use interrupts that conflict with the IBM SDLC
  adapters. This is normally done through EISA configuration programs, CMOS
  setup programs, or jumpers on the motherboard.

The IBM SDLC adapter has a known hardware conflict with the Microsoft Windows
Sound System adapter--both attempt to use the same I/O address on the bus, which
makes these adapters incompatible on the same PC. The Sound System adapter must
be removed from the PC in order for the IBM SDLC adapter to work.

If you are using an IBM token ring adapter in an ISA or EISA bus system, you
should do the following:

- By default, Windows NT loads PARALLEL.SYS during initialization. To avoid
  interrupt conflicts between PARALLEL.SYS and IBMTOK.SYS, the IBM Token Ring
  device driver, be sure to choose an interrupt other than 7 on your IBM Token
  Ring card, or disable the Parallel driver services by using the Devices
  option in the Windows NT Control Panel.

- Disable any parallel ports that use interrupts that conflict with the IBM
  Token Ring cards. This is normally done through EISA configuration programs,
  CMOS setup programs, or jumpers on the motherboard.
