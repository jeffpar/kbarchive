SUMMARY
=======

The Microsoft SNA Server version 2.x package does not include support for IBM
3287 host print emulation. However, several third-party companies do support
printer emulation, which are listed in the ISV Companion Product Catalog that is
included with SNA Server.

SNA Server 3.0 and later removes the need for a third party emulator by including
a print server. The print server allows 3270 printer emulation to be configured
and maintained centrally, rather than at each client desktop. For more details
about this feature, see the 3.0 or 4.0 product documentation or
http:\\www.microsoft.com\sna.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To support host print emulation (often referred to as 3287 print emulation) with
SNA Server versions prior to 3.0, a third-party product must be used, because
the low-end 3270 emulator included with the product only supports display
emulation.

To run the third-party print emulation package at the server, a 32-bit Windows
host print emulation product must be used. Also, a third-party emulator could
also run on any SNA Server client platform (that is, a Windows 3.x emulator runs
on an SNA Server Windows 3.x client, and so on).

To support print emulation, the administrator must define 3270 printer LUs in the
SNA Server configuration file (using SNA Admin), and assign these LUs to an SNA
Server user or to a group account where the print emulator will be running. When
users route print data to the printer LU supported by a printer emulation
package, SNA Server routes the host print job to the print emulator, whether it
resides on the server or an SNA Server client (that is, it does not flow to the
3270 display emulator user who initiated the host print job).

Also, note that the Windows 16-bit and 32-bit 3270 applets that are shipped with
SNA Server does include a local screen print capability, where screen data can
be routed to a local printer, or redirected to a network printer.
