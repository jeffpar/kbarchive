The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The following article contains information on the use of Windows for
Workgroups with third-party products or configurations that have not
been tested and are not supported by Microsoft.

If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for more
information or use a supported configuration.

SUMMARY
=======

This article provides instructions on how to install the Novell ODINSUP driver
to work with Windows for Workgroups 3.11. Novell's ODINSUP driver allows NDIS 2
protocols (such as MS TCP/IP) to run on top of Novell's ODI drivers. This
behavior is similar to that of the MSODISUP driver that comes with Windows for
Workgroups 3.11. The only difference is that the MSODISUP driver allows only
NDIS 3 protocols to run on top of it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following instructions assist you in setting up Windows for Workgroups 3.11
to run on the Novell ODINSUP driver with NetWare clients that are using Novell's
NETx redirector. By doing this, you can use NDIS 2 protocols (such as MS TCP/IP
or MS DLC) to run on top of the Novell ODI drivers. The steps below outline
setting up Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with the MS TCP/IP, NetBEUI, and NWLink
protocols in addition to Novell's real-mode IPX protocol. The network card used
throughout this article is the 3COM 3c509 Etherlink III.

Before You Begin:

Since this configuration requires the Novell IPXODI drivers, you must have your
machine set up and attached to a Novell server using IPXODI.COM at MS- DOS
before proceeding to the "Setup Instructions" section below. You should also set
up a working NET.CFG file in the same directory from which you load LSL.COM

Be sure to back up your AUTOEXEC.BAT file so that you can restore this
configuration later if necessary.

Setup Instructions:

1. Install Windows for Workgroups using the Custom Setup option. In the Network
  Setup dialog box, select the Other option button, select Novell, and then
  choose the Drivers button. Select the network card driver for your adapter
  along with both the NetBEUI and the IPX/SPX Compatible Transport with NetBIOS
  protocols. (Note that for the examples in this article, we chose the
  Etherlink III network adapter.) Next, in the same Network Drivers dialog box,
  choose Setup and choose Real Mode NDIS Driver. This is important because even
  though you are actually running an ODI driver with ODINSUP, Windows for
  Workgroups thinks you are running an NDIS driver. Choose OK and continue with
  Setup. Ignore the error messages about ODI drivers. After you finish Setup,
  reboot your computer and start Windows by using the /N switch (WIN /N), then
  install MS TCP/IP according to the directions that come with the MS TCP/IP
  package.

  NOTE: If there are any other NDIS 2 protocols (such as MS DLC) you want to
  install, install those now. Also, make sure that you choose which protocol
  you want to be the default protocol in the Network Drivers dialog box.

2. After completing the MS TCP/IP installation, edit the SYSTEM.INI file and
  remove the NDIS 2 driver, &lt;ELNK3.DOS&gt;, from the netcard= line of the
  [Network Drivers] section.

  NOTE: If you are using a different network card, the NDIS network card driver
  (&lt;ELNK3.DOS&gt; in the above example) will be different.

3. Edit the CONFIG.SYS file and set LASTDRIVE=P. This allows you to use the
  drive letters before P to connect to other Windows for Workgroups servers and
  driver letters after P to connect to NetWare servers. You can adjust this to
  fit your needs; however, Windows for Workgroups drives can map only up to and
  including the drive to which LASTDRIVE has been set.

4. Edit the AUTOEXEC.BAT file so that it contains the following lines:

  C:\WINDOWS\NET INIT
           &lt;==This loads protman and NDIS protocols&gt;
        C:\&lt;PATH&gt;\LSL.COM
        C:\&lt;PATH&gt;\&lt;your network card's ODI MAC driver&gt;.COM
        C:\&lt;PATH&gt;\ODINSUP.COM
        C:\WINDOWS\NET START NETBIND (This binds the protocols to ODINSUP.)
        C:\&lt;PATH&gt;\IPXODI.COM
        C:\&lt;PATH&gt;\NETX.EXE
           (The rest of these files are for MS TCP/IP.)
        C:\WINDOWS\UMB
        C:\WINDOWS\TCPTSR
        C:\WINDOWS\TINYRFC
        C:\WINDOWS\NMTSR.EXE
        C:\WINDOWS\EMSBFR.EXE

5. Edit the NET.CFG file and verify that it contains the following lines. If
  these lines don't exist, add them to the appropriate sections of the NET.CFG
  file. If you do not have a NET.CFG file, create one using a text editor (such
  as Microsoft Windows Notepad), and save it in the directory from which
  LSL.COM is executed. Note that some of the lines in the NET.CFG file are
  indented; this indentation must be maintained.

        PB BUFFERS 7
        PROTOCOL ODINSUP
           BIND &lt;3c509&gt; (where &lt;3C509&gt; is the filename of your network
                         card's ODI driver.)
           BUFFERED
        LINK DRIVER &lt;3c509&gt; (where &lt;3C509&gt; is the filename of your network
                             card's ODI driver.)
           INT &lt;n&gt; (where &lt;n&gt; is the one-digit interrupt number.)
           MEM &lt;nnnnn&gt; (where &lt;nnnnn&gt; is the five-digit memory address.)
           PORT &lt;nnn&gt; (where &lt;nnn&gt; is the three-digit I/O port address.)
           FRAME ETHERNET_802.2
           FRAME ETHERNET_802.3
           FRAME ETHERNET_II
           FRAME ETHERNET_SNAP
           PROTOCOL IPX 0 ETHERNET_802.3

  NOTE: If you have been using ODI to attach to a Novell server at DOS and you
  haven't specified the parameters INT, MEM, PORT, DMA, SLOT, and so forth in
  the NET.CFG file, you probably don't need to add them now. However, depending
  on the ODI MAC driver you are using (Novell refers to this as the "MLID"),
  you may need to place these parameters after the FRAME lines. Additionally,
  list your network's frame type FIRST in the list of "FRAME
  ETHERNET_&lt;xxxx&gt;" entries (where &lt;xxxx&gt; will probably be
  &lt;802.3&gt; or &lt;II&gt;).

6. Edit the PROTOCOL.INI file by replacing the BINDINGS= lines in the [NWLINK],
  [NETBEUI], [MS$NDISHLP], and [TCPIP] sections with the Novell ODI MAC driver
  (MLID) as follows:

     [NWLINK]
     ;BINDINGS=&lt;MS$ELNK3&gt; (where &lt;MS$ELNK3&gt; corresponds to your NDIS MAC
                           driver; in this case, ELINK3.DOS. The semicolon
                           comments out this line.)
     BINDINGS=&lt;x3c509&gt; (where &lt;x3c509&gt; corresponds to your ODI MLID;
                        in this case, 3c509.COM. The "x" must be added if the
                        ODI MLID filename begins with a numeral.)

     [NETBEUI]
     ;BINDINGS=&lt;MS$ELNK3&gt; (where &lt;MS$ELNK3&gt; corresponds to your NDIS MAC
                           driver; in this case, ELINK3.DOS. The semicolon
                           comments out this line.)
     BINDINGS=&lt;x3c509&gt; (where &lt;x3c509&gt; corresponds to your ODI MLID;
                        in this case, 3c509.COM. The "x" must be added if the
                        ODI MLID filename begins with a numeral.)
     LANABASE=0
     SESSIONS=10
     NCBS=12
     DriverName=netbeui$

     [MS$NDISHLP]
     DriverName=ndishlp$
     ;BINDINGS=&lt;MS$ELNK3&gt; (where &lt;MS$ELNK3&gt; corresponds to your NDIS MAC
                           driver; in this case, ELINK3.DOS. The semicolon
                           comments out this line.)
     BINDINGS=&lt;x3c509&gt; (where &lt;x3c509&gt; corresponds to your ODI MLID;
                        in this case, 3c509.COM. The "x" must be added if the
                        ODI MLID filename begins with a numeral.)

     [TCPIP]
     IPAddress0=&lt;130 25 40 20&gt; (where &lt;130 25 40 20&gt; corresponds to your own
                                IP Addresses.)
     DefaultGateway0=130 25 0 1
     SubNetMask0=255 255 0 0
     NBSessions=6
     NetFiles=C:\WINDOWS
     DriverName=TCPIP$
     ;BINDINGS=&lt;MS$ELNK3&gt; (where &lt;MS$ELNK3&gt; corresponds to your NDIS MAC
                           driver; in this case, ELINK3.DOS. The semicolon
                           comments out this line.)
     BINDINGS=&lt;x3c509&gt; (where &lt;x3c509&gt; corresponds to your ODI MLID;
                        in this case, 3c509.COM. The "x" must be added if the
                        ODI MLID filename begins with a numeral.)
     LANABASE=2

  NOTE: If you are using the Microsoft 32-bit TCP/IP dated 11/21/94, you must
  change the "bindings=" setting in the network card section of the SYSTEM.INI
  file to match the ODI MLID name.

  IMPORTANT: If the ODI MLID filename begins with a numeral, you must preface
  the filename with an "x" (without the quotation marks) in the BINDINGS=
  statement. For example, 3COM's 3C509 network adapter card uses an ODI MLID
  with the filename 3C509.COM. In the PROTOCOL.INI file, the BINDINGS=
  statements would need to be:

  BINDINGS=x3C509

  WARNING: After you make these modifications, do NOT make any changes in the
  Network dialog box of Control Panel. If you do, the AUTOEXEC.BAT, SYSTEM.INI
  and PROTOCOL.INI files will be overwritten. You should make backup copies of
  these files in case this occurs.
