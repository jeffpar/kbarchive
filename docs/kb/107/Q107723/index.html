=======

You can copy text and graphics between Creative Writer, Fine Artist, and other
applications.

If you copy a picture in Creative Writer or Fine Artist, and then switch to
another application, you can paste the graphic by choosing the paste option in
that application. If you have a graphic in the Clipboard when you start or
switch to Creative Writer or Fine Artist, you can paste into your document by
choosing the Paste tool.

You can also import into Creative Writer or Fine Artist graphics files created in
other applications.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In Windows, you can import graphics into Creative Writer and Fine Artist in the
following formats:

- .BMP (bitmaps)

- .DIB (device-independent bitmaps)

- .WMF (Windows metafiles)

With the Macintosh, you can import graphics in the PICT format.

Cutting or Copying
------------------

1. Click the Re-Mover tool -- scissors and glue in Creative Writer; vacuum in
  Fine Artist.

2. Click the Camera copy tool or the Scissors cut tool. In Fine Artist, click
  the Sticker Sucker.

3. Click and drag to select the text you want to copy; In Fine Artist, click the
  stickers you would like to copy.

4. Switch to the application to which you would like to paste the contents of
  the Clipboard and use that application's instructions to paste the contents.

Importing Graphics
------------------

1. In the Writing or Painting Studio or Project Workshop, create a new document
  or open a document.

2. Click the Sticker Picker "Mona Weasel" (an orange icon of a big-nosed
  character, just to the right of the "A").

3. Ratdog appears, just to the right of the rolls of stickers. Click Ratdog.

4. In the Portfolio Contents list, click Outside Of Imaginopolis. Ratdog
  searches your entire hard drive for graphics files in the supported formats.

5. From the list filenames, select your graphic. A preview image appears.

6. Choose Go.

The graphic appears on your page.

Graphics you copy from Creative Writer and Fine Artist are in PICT format on the
Macintosh and .BMP format in Windows.

Creative Writer documents are saved in a proprietary format, called RIFF
(resource interchange file format). These files can be transferred between the
Macintosh and Windows versions of Creative Writer without any translation. You
cannot save graphics out from Creative Writer in any other format. However, you
can save text from Creative Writer in the .TXT (text only) format, and open the
text file in other applications.


You can save pictures from Fine Artist for Windows in a .BMP format, and in a
PICT format on the Macintosh. You can then open it in other applications that
read graphics files.
