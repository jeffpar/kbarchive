SYMPTOMS
========

If you create a greeting card in Creative Writer and then try to start over with
the "all gone" (explosion/bomb) tool, all the pages will disappear except for
the first one. You won't be able to return to an "all pages" view even if you
choose that view with the Page Viewer (magnifying glass) Tool. However, if you
create something on the remaining page and print it, it will print as if it were
the first page of a greeting card. In other words, it won't print on the full
page of paper; it will print only on the lower right-hand quarter of the page.

The "all gone" tool should either leave you with a four-page display, so that it
is obvious that you are still in a card document, or it should return to a full
page mode.

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Creative Writer versions 1.0,
1.1, and 1.1a. We are researching this problem and will post new information
here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
