- Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 3.1 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The documentation on page 652 of the Microsoft Windows version 3.1 Software
Development Kit (SDK) "Programmer's Reference, Volume 2: Functions" manual about
NFY_RIP notification being sent to a callback function registered by
NotifyRegister function is incorrect. The NFY_RIP notification is not received
in Windows version 3.0.

Note, however, that the documentation in the Windows SDK online Help file
(WIN31WH.HLP) corrects this error by stating that the NFY_RIP notification is
received only under Windows version 3.1.

MORE INFORMATION
================

NotifyRegister() is an application programming interface (API) in the
TOOLHELP.DLL shipped with Windows 3.1 that can be used by an application to
obtain system notifications or information on system events. NotifyRegister()
installs a notification callback procedure associated with a given task that is
called by Windows on every system event. The callback function receives
notification on system debugging errors (or system RIPs) only when the NF_RIP
flag is set. Once the NFY_RIP notification is received, the callback could post
a message passing the task handle or the notification ID to the main window, and
let the main message processing take the appropriate action.

The documentation states that the callback function receives a NFY_RIP
notification on every Fatal Exit message in Windows version 3.0 and later. This
is not correct, because the callback function does not receive the NFY_RIP
notification when a Fatal Exit message is generated while running under debug
version of Windows 3.0. The NFY_RIP notification is received only under Windows
version 3.1.
