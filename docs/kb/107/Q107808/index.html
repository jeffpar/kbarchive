The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups versions 3.1, 3.11 
- Microsoft Windows versions 3.1, 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This article contains information about using Windows for Workgroups
with a third-party product that has not been tested and is not supported
by Microsoft.

If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, contact the manufacturer of the third-party product for
more information.

SYMPTOMS
========

After you install Novell NetWare version 3.12 or 4.0x client software to a
shared copy of Windows or Windows for Workgroups, you may receive the following
error message:

  NetWare shell incompatible

  Cannot use a device specified in the SYSTEM.INI file. The device may be
  necessary to run Windows in 386 enhanced mode.

  If you experience problems, run the Setup program again.

  C:\WINDOWS\vnetware.386

CAUSE
=====

The Novell NetWare client install for versions 3.12 and 4.0x uses VLM.EXE in
place of NETX.EXE. If you are using VLM.EXE, the Novell NetWare client software
does not properly update a shared copy of Windows (SETUP /A and SETUP /N);
therefore, you must add the new Windows support files provided by Novell
NetWare.

RESOLUTION
==========

To correctly install the NetWare client software to both the shared copy of
Windows on the NetWare server and to all user directories, perform the steps
below.

NOTE: These steps assume that you have run SETUP /A on the server and SETUP /N to
a user directory that has not been modified by the NetWare 4.0x client install:

1. Create an empty subdirectory on the local drive.

2. Create two blank files in this directory named WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI.

3. Run the Novell NetWare client install utility. This utility is provided by
  Novell and will add the files needed for Windows. During the NetWare client
  install process, step 3 gives the option to install support for Windows and
  to provide the location of the Windows directory. You must choose Yes to
  install support for Windows, and point it to the empty subdirectory created
  in Step 1.

4. Once the installation is finished, delete all *.INI files in the subdirectory
  specified in step 1.

5. Change to the mapped drive and directory in which the shared Windows
  directory (SETUP /A) is located, and remove the read-only attribute from all
  files in the shared Windows directory.

6. The NetWare client install creates the following two subdirectories under the
  subdirectory created in step 1:

  NLS and SYSTEM

7. Copy the files from the SYSTEM subdirectory to the shared Windows directory
  on the NetWare server (where the SETUP /A was installed). This should copy
  the following five files:

  NETWARE.DRV
  NETWARE.HLP
  VNETWARE.386
  VIPX.386
  NWPOPUP.EXE

8. Delete these files in the SYSTEM subdirectory and remove the SYSTEM
  subdirectory.

9. Copy the remaining files in the subdirectory created in step 1, along with
  the entire NLS subdirectory, to the shared Windows directory on the NetWare
  server.

10. Delete the NLS subdirectory and the subdirectory created in step 1.

11. You then need to mark all files in the shared Windows directory with the
  read-only attribute. This can be done by typing

  attrib *.* +r

  in the subdirectory in which the shared copy of Windows was installed.

12. Add the following lines to the [386Enh] section of the SYSTEM.INI file in
  the Windows user directory for all workstations that will be running either
  the NetWare 3.12 or 4.0x client:

  TimerCriticalSection=10000
  ReflectDOSInt2A=TRUE
  UniqueDOSPSP=TRUE
  PSPIncrement=5
  OverlappedIO=OFF

  NOTE: With Windows for Workgroups 3.11, these lines should already exist if
  support for Novell NetWare 4.x was installed during Setup.

13. You can then run the client install to all other workstations on the network
  running Novell NetWare version 3.12 or 4.0 as needed. When the install
  utility asks if you want to install support for Windows, choose No. Each
  workstation will use the updated Novell files in the shared Windows
  directory.

  NOTE: Novell NetWare install adds a group to Windows Program Manager for the
  Novell Utilities. If you want to install this group after following the
  above steps, continue with the following steps; otherwise, you can stop
  here.

14. Copy the NWUTILS.GRP file from the shared Windows directory to each Windows
  user directory on all workstations to which you want to add the group.

15. From each workstation, run Windows.

16. In Program Manager, choose New from the File menu.

17. Select the Program Group option button, then choose OK.

18. In the Description box, type "NetWare" (without the quotation marks).

19. In the Group File box, type "NWUTILS.GRP" (without the quotation marks).

20. Choose OK.

NOTE: The above steps do not work properly with Windows for Workgroups 3.1
because that version does not support connectivity with Novell NetWare using
Novell's ODI specification.

Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding these products'
