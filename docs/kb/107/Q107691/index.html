SUMMARY
=======

The DebugOutput() API has been added to Windows version 3.1. A Windows- based
application can use this function to send a message to a debugging terminal
connected to the COM1 port or to a window by using DBWIN. In the 16-bit Windows
SDK, DBWIN is a sample application installed in the samples directory (by
default, C:\WINDEV\SAMPLES\DBWIN directory). DBWIN is also a sample in Visual
C++ for Windows. In the Win32 SDK for Windows NT 3.5 and Windows 95, DBWIN is
located in MSTOOLS\BIN.

NOTE: The DebugOutput() function works only under the debug version of Windows.
However, there are certain issues that must be considered while using this
function.

MORE INFORMATION
================

1. DebugOutput() is present only in the debugging version of Windows. The retail
  version of Windows contains a stub function at this entry point. While an
  application won't fail if it calls this stub function, the stub won't produce
  any output on the debug terminal. Before starting the debug version of
  Windows and using DebugOutput(), certain issues must be considered. For
  example, add the following lines to the [Windows] section of the WIN.INI
  file

     DebugOptions=0X0000
     DebugFilter=0X0000
     DebugTaskFilter=                  ; leave it blank

  and add the following new section to your SYSTEM.INI file:

     [Debug]
     OutputTo=NUL

  The setting for the OutputTo entry in the SYSTEM.INI file disables the default
  debug kernel output to the AUX device (which maps to the COM1 port). This
  setting is recommended because the DBWIN Windows sample application can be
  used to redirect output to either COM1 or COM2.

  The setting for the DebugOptions entry corresponds to the value for the
  dwOptions member of the WINDEBUGINFO structure in the Windows SDK. The
  setting for the DebugFilter entry corresponds to the value for the dwFilter
  member of WINDEBUGINFO. To determine the proper hexadecimal value for a
  setting, add the values of the options to be set. For example, to specify
  DBO_CHECKHEAP and DBO_FREEFILL, the setting for the DebugOptions entry would
  be 0x0021 (0x0001 plus 0x0020). For information about the possible values for
  these options and a full description of the WINDEBUGINFO structure, see the
  Microsoft Windows SDK "Programmer's Reference, Volume 3: Messages,
  Structures, and Macros."

2. The DebugOutput() function is prototyped in the WINDOWS.H header file
  provided with the Windows SDK; however, it is not listed in the LIBW.LIB
  import library. Therefore, a Windows-based application that uses the
  DebugOutput function must import the function in the application's module
  definition (DEF) file. Add the following lines to the DEF file to import the
  DebugOutput function:

     IMPORTS
        _DebugOutput = KERNEL._DebugOutput

  The leading underscore in the function name and the capitalization of the name
  are important because the DebugOutput function is declared using the C
  calling convention.

3. The Windows SDK documentation states that the DBF_TRACE flag can be used to
  supply trace information when an error occurs. This information may be useful
  in debugging an application. However, the DBF_TRACE flag does not work by
  itself; this flag must be OR'ed with another flag, typically the
  DBF_APPLICATION flag. For example, the following works:

     DebugOutput( DBF_TRACE | DBF_APPLICATION, "This is a trace
     message.");
