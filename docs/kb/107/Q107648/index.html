The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups version 3.11 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This article contains information about using Windows for Workgroups with
third-party products or configurations that have not been tested and are
not supported by Microsoft.

If the steps or procedures described in this article do not function
properly, use a supported configuration or contact the manufacturer of the
third-party product for more information.

SUMMARY
=======

The Novell ODINSUP driver allows NDIS 2 protocols (such as MS TCP/IP) to run on
top of Novell ODI drivers. This is similar to the behavior of the MSODISUP
driver that comes with Windows for Workgroups 3.11. The difference is that the
MSODISUP driver allows only NDIS 3 protocols to run on top of it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following instructions assist you in setting up Windows for Workgroups 3.11
to run on the Novell ODINSUP driver with NetWare clients that are using Novell's
VLM.EXE redirector. By doing this, you can use NDIS 2 protocols (such as MS
TCP/IP and MS DLC) to run on top of the Novell ODI drivers. The steps below
outline setting up Windows for Workgroups 3.11 with the MS TCP/IP, NetBEUI, and
NWLink protocols in addition to Novell's real-mode IPX protocol. The network
card used throughout this article is the 3COM1 3c509 Etherlink III.

Before You Begin:

You should run the Novell NetWare 4.0 client installation program and have a
working NetWare 4.0 client. You should also set up a working Net.cfg file in the
same directory from which you load LSL.COM.

By default, NetWare 4.0 loads the network drivers in a Startnet.bat file and then
"calls" this file from the Autoexec.bat file. Be sure to back up this file along
with your Autoexec.bat file so that you can restore this configuration later if
necessary.

Setup Instructions:

1. Install Windows for Workgroups using the Custom Setup option. In the Network
  Setup dialog box, select the Other option button, select Novell, and then
  choose the Drivers button. Select the network card driver for your adapter
  along with both the NetBEUI and the "IPX/SPX Compatible Transport with
  NetBIOS" protocols. (For the examples in this article, we chose the Etherlink
  III network card.) Next, in the same Network Drivers dialog box, choose Setup
  and select Real Mode NDIS Driver. This is important because even though you
  are actually running on an ODI driver with ODINSUP, Windows for Workgroups
  thinks you are running an NDIS driver. Choose OK and continue with Setup.
  Ignore the error messages about ODI drivers. After you finish Setup, you
  reboot your computer and start Windows by using the /N switch (WIN /N), then
  install MS TCP/IP according to the directions that come with the package.

  NOTE: If there are any other NDIS 2 protocols (such as MS DLC) you want to
  install, install them now. Also, make sure that you choose which protocol you
  want to be the default protocol in the Network Drivers dialog box.

2. After completing MS TCP/IP setup, edit the System.ini file and remove the
  NDIS 2 driver, &lt;ELNK3.DOS&gt;, from the netcard= line of the [Network
  Drivers] section.

  NOTE: If you are using a different network card, the NDIS network card driver
  (&lt;ELNK3.DOS&gt; in the above example) will be different.

3. Edit the Config.sys file and set LASTDRIVE=Z. This allows you to connect all
  available drive letters to both NetWare and Windows for Workgroups servers.

4. If you are using a STARTNET.BAT file, remove the NET START line from the
  Autoexec.bat file and then edit the STARTNET.BAT file so that it contains the
  following network-related lines. If you are not using a STARTNET.BAT file,
  put these lines in your Autoexec.bat file.

        SET NWLANGUAGE=ENGLISH
        C:\WINDOWS\NET INIT (This loads protman and NDIS protocols.)
        C:\&lt;PATH&gt;\LSL.COM
        C:\&lt;PATH&gt;\&lt;your network card's ODI MAC driver&gt;.COM
        C:\&lt;PATH&gt;\ODINSUP.COM
        C:\WINDOWS\NET START NETBIND (This binds the protocols to ODINSUP.)
        C:\&lt;PATH&gt;\IPXODI.COM
        C:\&lt;PATH&gt;\VLM.EXE
            (The rest of these files are for MS TCP/IP.)
        C:\WINDOWS\UMB
        C:\WINDOWS\TCPTSR
        C:\WINDOWS\TINYRFC
        C:\WINDOWS\NMTSR.EXE
        C:\WINDOWS\EMSBFR.EXE

5. Edit the Net.cfg file and verify that it contains the following lines. If
  these lines don't exist, add them to the appropriate sections of the Net.cfg
  file. If you do not have a Net.cfg file, create one using a text editor (such
  as Microsoft Windows Notepad), and save it in the directory from which
  LSL.COM is executed. Note that some of the lines in the Net.cfg file are
  indented; this indentation must be maintained.

        PB BUFFERS 7
        PROTOCOL ODINSUP
           BIND &lt;3c509&gt; (where &lt;3c509&gt; is the filename of your network
                          card's ODI driver)
           BUFFERED
        LINK DRIVER &lt;3c509&gt; (where &lt;3c509&gt; is the filename of your network
                          card's ODI driver)
           INT &lt;n&gt; (where &lt;n&gt; is the one-digit interrupt number)
           MEM &lt;nnnnn&gt; (where &lt;nnnnn&gt; is the five-digit memory address)
           PORT &lt;nnn&gt; (where &lt;nnn&gt; is the three-digit I/O port address)
           FRAME ETHERNET_802.2
           FRAME ETHERNET_802.3
           FRAME ETHERNET_II
           FRAME ETHERNET_SNAP
           PROTOCOL IPX 0 ETHERNET_802.3
     First Network Drive = F

  NOTE: If you've been using ODI to attach to a Novell server at DOS and you
  haven't specified the parameters INT, MEM, PORT, DMA, SLOT, and so forth in
  the Net.cfg file, you probably don't need to add them now. However, depending
  on the ODI MAC driver you are using (Novell refers to this as the "MLID"),
  you may need to place these parameters after the FRAME lines. Additionally,
  list your network's frame type FIRST in the list of "FRAME
  ETHERNET_&lt;xxxx&gt;" entries (where &lt;xxxx&gt; will probably be
  &lt;802.2&gt;, &lt;802.3&gt;, or &lt;II&gt;).

6. Edit the Protocol.ini file by replacing the BINDINGS= lines in the [NWLINK],
  [NETBEUI], [MS$NDISHLP], and [TCPIP] sections with the Novell ODI MAC driver
  (MLID) as follows:

     [NWLINK]
     ;BINDINGS=&lt;MS$ELNK3&gt; (where &lt;MS$ELNK3&gt; corresponds to your NDIS MAC
                           driver; in this case, ELINK3.DOS. The semicolon
                           comments out this line.)
     BINDINGS=&lt;x3c509&gt; (where &lt;x3c509&gt; corresponds to your ODI MLID;
                        in this case, 3c509.COM. The "x" must be
                        added if the ODI MLID filename begins with a
                        numeral.)

     [NETBEUI]
     ;BINDINGS=&lt;MS$ELNK3&gt; (where &lt;MS$ELNK3&gt; corresponds to your NDIS MAC
                           driver; in this case, ELINK3.DOS. The semicolon
                           comments out this line.)
     BINDINGS=&lt;x3c509&gt; (where &lt;x3c509&gt; corresponds to your ODI MLID;
                       in this case, 3c509.COM. The "x" must be
                        added if the ODI MLID filename begins with a
                        numeral.)
     LANABASE=0
     SESSIONS=10
     NCBS=12
     DriverName=netbeui$

     [MS$NDISHLP]
     DriverName=ndishlp$
     ;BINDINGS=&lt;MS$ELNK3&gt; (where &lt;MS$ELNK3&gt; corresponds to your NDIS MAC
                           driver; in this case, ELINK3.DOS. The semicolon
                           comments out this line.)
     BINDINGS=&lt;x3c509&gt; (where &lt;x3c509&gt; corresponds to your ODI MLID;
                        in this case, 3c509.COM. The "x" must be
                        added if the ODI MLID filename begins with a
                        numeral.)

     [TCPIP]
     IPAddress0=&lt;130 25 40 20&gt; (where &lt;130 25 40 20&gt; corresponds to your
                                own IP addresses.)
     DefaultGateway0=130 25 0 1
     SubNetMask0=255 255 0 0
     NBSessions=6
     NetFiles=C:\WINDOWS
     DriverName=TCPIP$
     ;BINDINGS=&lt;MS$ELNK3&gt; (where &lt;MS$ELNK3&gt; corresponds to your NDIS MAC
                           driver; in this case, ELINK3.DOS. The semicolon
                           comments out this line.)
     BINDINGS=&lt;x3c509&gt; (where &lt;x3c509&gt; corresponds to your ODI MLID;
                       in this case, 3c509.COM. The "x" must be
                       added if the ODI MLID filename begins with a
                       numeral.)
     LANABASE=2

  NOTE: If you are using the Microsoft 32-bit TCP/IP dated 11/21/94, you must
  change the "bindings=" setting in the network card section of the System.ini
  file to match the ODI MLID name, ensure ethernet_II appears in the frame
  listings in the Net.cfg file, and make the following changes to the
  System.ini file:

     [MS$ELNK3]
     IPMask=0.0.0.0
     IPAddress=0.0.0.0
     Description=3com Etherlink III
     ;BINDINGS=&lt;MS$ELNK3&gt; (where &lt;MS$ELNK3&gt; corresponds to your NDIS MAC
                           driver; in this case, ELINK3.DOS. The semicolon
                           comments out this line.)
     BINDINGS=&lt;x3c509&gt; (where &lt;x3c509&gt; corresponds to your ODI MLID;
                              in this case, 3c509.COM. The "x" must be
                              added if the ODI MLID filename begins with a
                              numeral.)

  IMPORTANT: If the ODI MLID filename begins with a numeral, you must preface
  the filename with an "x" (without the quotation marks) in the BINDINGS=
  statement. For example, the 3COM 3C509 network adapter card uses an ODI MLID
  with the filename 3C509.COM. In the Protocol.ini file, the BINDINGS=
  statements would need to be:

       BINDINGS=x3C509

  WARNING: After you make these modifications, do NOT make any changes in the
  Networks dialog box of Control Panel. If you do, the Autoexec.bat, System.ini
  and Protocol.ini files will be overwritten. You should make backup copies of
  these files in case this occurs.
