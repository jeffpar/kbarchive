Changes to the MS-DOS-Based Portion of Setup
--------------------------------------------

The Workgroup upgrade for Microsoft Windows version 3.0 users and the Workgroup
upgrade for Microsoft Windows version 3.1 users perform a version check and
require a previous version of Windows installed on the system. Setup looks for
the WIN.COM file.

During hardware detection, networks supported for Windows 3.1 are detected to
determine compatibility with Windows for Workgroups. Only Workgroup Connections,
NetWare, and Microsoft LAN Manager version 2.1 are compatible with Windows for
Workgroups.

The networks list is not shown in the system settings; WFWNET.DRV is the only
supported primary network for this version. NetWare can be added as a secondary
network later in the Windows-based portion of Setup.

SETUP /I disables hardware detection, including network software detection, and
initiates Custom Setup instead of Express Setup by default.

Changes to the Graphics-Based Portion of Setup
----------------------------------------------

The first event in the graphics-based portion of Windows for Workgroups Setup is
network card detection (NCD). If the system stops responding (hangs) at the
transition from the MS-DOS-based portion of Setup to the Windows-based portion
of Setup (at the blue "Windows Setup" screen), it is probably because of NCD.

To recover from this situation, restart the computer and run Setup again. Setup
leaves a flag in the SYSTEM.INI file so that NCD is not run the second time.
Running Setup with the /I parameter also disables NCD.

The user-information dialog box now contains computer name and workgroup in
addition to the user's name and company.

If MCSDEX.EXE or TBMI2.COM are in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file, Setup copies a new
version of these files to the WINDOWS directory and replaces the lines calling
these files in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. The /y parameter is also added to the
MSCDEX line. The mouse is handled in a similar fashion.

Network adapters, protocols, and secondary network drivers are added right after
printer installation.

The Exit Setup dialog box no longer contains the Restart Windows option because
the network drivers (WORKGRP.SYS and so forth) must be loaded by restarting the
computer.

Changes to Maintenance Mode of Setup
------------------------------------

The networks list is not shown in the system settings; WFWNET.DRV is the only
supported primary network for this version. The Network Adapter and Compatible
Networks dialog boxes are available from the Control Panel Networks option and
are not available from Setup in maintenance mode.
