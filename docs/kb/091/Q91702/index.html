SUMMARY
=======

You can delete a Microsoft Mail for PC Networks message from a shared folder if
you have been given DELETE privileges for that folder by the folder owner.

There are three folder privileges: READ, WRITE, and DELETE. When you create a
shared folder, Microsoft Mail assigns you READ and WRITE privileges by default.

The person who creates a folder is that folder's owner. The owner of a shared
folder can delete messages in that folder even though they have only the default
READ and WRITE privileges. However, Microsoft Mail will not allow any other user
to delete messages from that folder unless the folder owner has given them
DELETE privileges.

A shared folder owner can grant folder privileges to other users by following
these steps:

1. From the Options menu, choose Folders, then choose Modify.

2. Select the desired folder.

3. Using the TAB key, move to the Access Rights field. To add DELETE as a
  privilege, highlight DELETE and press the SPACEBAR.
