-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows for Workgroups 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

You may receive the following error message when using Windows for Workgroups:

  The protocol manager has reported an incomplete binding

The message can be preceded by a number, such as 5733 or 5773. For example:

  Error 5733: The protocol manager has reported an incomplete binding.

In most cases, Windows still functions after this message; however, all network
services are disabled.

CAUSE
=====

This message occurs due to several conditions, including:

- Incorrect NDIS Network Interface Card (NIC) driver loaded in the CONFIG.SYS
  file

- Incorrect network card configuration (PROTOCOL.INI)

- Hardware problem(s)

WORKAROUND
==========

Use the information in the following paragraphs to eliminate the conditions
listed above.

Incorrect NDIS NIC Driver Loaded in the CONFIG.SYS File
-------------------------------------------------------

This message may result if you have installed the wrong network card driver. To
verify that the driver you selected matches the network card you are using,
choose the Network icon from Control Panel. If the network card you are using is
not listed during setup, check the manufacturer's suggested emulation.

The network card supplier may need to provide an NDIS compatible driver. If the
card you are trying to install is not listed in Control Panel, contact the
network card manufacturer for a specific NDIS driver that works with Windows for
Workgroups.

The order of the network drivers in the CONFIG.SYS file is also important. For
example, protocol manager (PROTMAN.DOS) must load before any other Windows for
Workgroup network drivers. If PROTMAN.DOS does not load first, you may receive
the following variation of the message above:

  Error 5741: The protocol manager was unable to bind.

Incorrect Network Card Configuration (PROTOCOL.INI)
---------------------------------------------------

The protocol manager error message can also occur if the network adapter is
configured incorrectly. The configuration settings include IRQ, Base I/O port,
and Base Memory Address. To verify these settings, choose the Network icon from
Control Panel.

Some network adapters do not have an on-board transceiver, and use an external
transceiver to transmit data over the medium. If your network adapter works this
way, add the following entry to the section of the PROTOCOL.INI file that refers
to the specific net card using the external transceiver:

  [MS$NIUPC]
  TRANSCEIVER=EXTERNAL

You can also correct your settings by deleting the PROTOCOL.INI, PROTMAN.DOS,
WORKGRP.SYS, and other Workgroup network driver files. Then, from Control Panel,
choose the Network icon, and indicate the correct network adapter and
configuration settings.

Note: Each time the PROTOCOL.INI file is updated, the old one is saved with a
sequentially numbered extension (that is, PROTOCOL.000, PROTOCOL.001,
PROTOCOL.002, and so forth). By referring this naming convention, you may be
able to recover an earlier PROTOCOL.INI that was once configured correctly.

Hardware Problem(s)
-------------------

This error message could also indicate problems with the network adapter. Check
to make sure that the adapter is seated properly in the computer's expansion
slot. If the error message continues, try inserting a different network adapter,
then verify the correct setting for that card. Check for other potential
problems including incorrect cabling, improper installation of T-connectors and
terminators, and check other connections within the workgroup.
