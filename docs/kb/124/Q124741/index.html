The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft WinG API, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Microsoft has confirmed the items in the following list to be bugs in the
Microsoft WinG API.


- Some Western Digital drivers cause the WinG display profiler to crash.

  The second time a WinG application is run, the profiler will not run and WinG
  will attempt to use the driver's StretchDIBits without profiling. This may or
  may not let the application run depending on what caused the original crash.


- The WinG installation will not work on networked Windows installations (setup
  /n) because the WinG setup program needs to write to the system directory.


- If your application needs to link to TOOLHELP, you must call TOOLHELP's
  LibMain before you call WinG. Work-arounds include changing the DLL
  initialization order, or linking dynamically to WING.DLL or TOOLHELP.DLL. If
  you are using Microsoft Visual C++, you can change the initialization order
  by following these steps:

  1. Go to Project/Edit and check the list of files you have in the project. If
     you have included WING.LIB, delete it.

  2. Go to Options/Project/Linker/Input/Windows Libraries and clear the
     TOOLHELP selection.

  3. Go to Options/Project/Linker/Input/Input and hard code the locations of
     TOOLHELP.LIB, followed by WING.LIB and then the rest of the libraries as
     usual. For example: C:\MSVC\LIB\TOOLHELP, C:\WING\LIB\WING, oldnames,
     libw, mlibcew


- Video cards using the Cirrus Logic chipset may cause WinG to display the
  following warning each time WinG is loaded; once should be enough:

  WinG has encountered a problem with your video display driver. Contact the
  manufacturer of your card to obtain the most recent driver. Your WinG
  applications will still run, but at reduced speed.


- When WinG closes down, it leaks selectors, the memory is freed when the WinG
  DLL exits.

- On Win32s, calls to WinGGetDIBColorTable() do not retrieve the color table of
  a WinG bitmap. Possible work-arounds include keeping track of the color table
  yourself or thunking to the 16-bit WinGGetDIBColorTable().

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed these to be bugs in WinG version 1.0. Microsoft is
researching these problems and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
