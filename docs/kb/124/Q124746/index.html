-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The following error may display when a reply is sent to an MHS mail user from
Microsoft Mail in a non-delivery notice:

  Invalid Address

CAUSE
=====

This may happen if the original message received by the Microsoft Mail user
through the MHS gateway includes a comment field in the header, that contains a
comma. In this case, the comma is seen as an address delimiter. Everything
before the comma is one address, and everything after the comma is a separate
address.

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix that corrects this problem is now available from Microsoft, but
has not been fully regression-tested and should be applied only to systems
experiencing this specific problem.

To resolve this problem, contact Microsoft Product Support Services to obtain the
fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services phone numbers and
information on support costs, please go to the following address on the World
Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

  File Name     Version
  ---------------------
  Outpost.exe   3.0.7

This hotfix has been posted to the following Internet location as Mhsgy2k.exe:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/mail/gateways-public/All-Y2K/


STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Mail Gateway to MHS
version 3.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The updated version of the OUTPOST.EXE file resolves this issue by not using
commas inside comments as address delimiters.

Additional query words: 3.00 3.0.5
