The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
- Microsoft LAN Manager to Windows NT Advanced Server Upgrade, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run ACLCONV (used to convert LAN Manager access control lists [ACLs] to
Windows NT permissions on Windows NT file system [NTFS] files), it incorrectly
replaces permissions for mapped accounts and reports the following error in the
ACLCONV log:

  User or Group ID not found.

CAUSE
=====

ACLCONV does not read the ACLWORK.DAT file and is therefore unaware of the
account mappings.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.1 and 3.5.
We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

USERCONV.EXE allows you to map accounts from the LAN Manager domain to the
Windows NT domain using NETACC.BKP for input. USERCONV displays a list of the
accounts on the LAN Manager server and the Windows NT server. You can map one or
more LAN Manager accounts to one Windows NT account. You can keep the same
account names when upgrading from LAN Manager to Windows NT, or you can have all
of the permissions currently granted to a LAN Manager group (for example,
Operators) assigned to a new Windows NT domain group (for example, Server
Operators).

USERCONV updates the user account database with the LAN Manager accounts that
were not mapped, and creates a data file, that contains all of the account
mapping information. ACLWORK.DAT contains these mappings and USERWORK.DAT
contains a text version of the mappings.

ACLCONV is supposed to read ACLWORK.DAT. ACLCONV reads the ACLBAKx.ACL file that
was created on the LAN Manager server and updates permissions on the Windows NT
volume to correspond to the previous permissions on the HPFS volume. USERCONV
should search the ACLWORK.DAT file for all of the user IDs it reads from the ACL
backup file. If no account mapping is found, it should update the permissions
for the user account of the same name. If a mapping is found in the ACLWORK.DAT
file, the permissions should be transferred to the new account name.
