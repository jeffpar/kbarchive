SUMMARY
=======

In Windows NT 3.5, the LPR command (LPR.EXE) can be used to send a file directly
to an LPD server without using Print Manager. The LPR command usually defaults
to the 'f' control character, which tells the LPD server to format the incoming
file, taking out any extraneous ASCII control characters.

MORE INFORMATION
================

It is possible to send a different control character to an LPD server through
the LPR.EXE command by using the following parameter

  -oX

where X is the control character that will be passed to the LPD server.

The following command is an example of using the Windows NT LPR command to send a
file to a UNIX LPD server and have the file formatted as a PostScript print
job:

  LPR -S 100.10.10.10 -P printq -oo c:\test.txt

  NOTE: If the -o parameter is used without a control character, LPR will
  send an 'l' control character to the LPD server, instructing it not to
  format the print job.

Control characters coming from an LPR client instruct an LPD server on how to
handle the incoming print job (or data file). Not all LPD servers implement all
control characters, contact the manufacturer of the LPD server to verify what
control characters are supported.

For additional information on LPR.EXE, type the following at a Windows NT command
prompt:

  LPR /?

For additional information on control characters and LPR/LPD, refer to RFC1179,
which is the standard for TCP/IP Printing.

NOTE: LPR through the Windows NT Print Manager by default uses the 'l' control
character, which tells the LPD server not to format the print job. This is
necessary because a Windows NT printer driver has already formatted the job. LPR
through the Print Manager can be configured in the Registry; for information on
doing this, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
