  Q119591 How to Obtain Microsoft Support Files from Online Services

Microsoft used the most current virus detection software available on the date of
posting to scan this file for viruses. Once posted, the file is housed on secure
servers that prevent any unauthorized changes to the file.

After you download MHSGINST.EXE or MHSAINST.EXE to a clean directory, run it (by
typing "mhsginst" (without the quotation marks) or "mhsainst" (without the
quotation marks), respectively, at the MS-DOS prompt) to extract the contents of
the file. You should receive the following files:

  MHSGINST.EXE:
  INSTALL.EXE (40,233 bytes, dated 12-20-94, 8:59 A.M.)
  README.TXT

  MHSAINST.EXE:
  INSTALL.EXE (42,345 bytes, dated 12-19-94, 1:51 P.M.)
  README.TXT

To replace your INSTALL.EXE file:

1. At the MS-DOS command prompt, type the following and press ENTER

  " copy &lt;path&gt;:\install.exe &lt;destination&gt; " (without the quotation
  marks)

  where &lt;path&gt; is the drive and directory where you ran the self
  extracting MHSGINST.EXE or MHSAINST.EXE file and &lt;destination&gt; is the
  drive and directory where your Gateway to MHS or Gateway to MHS Access disk
  currently resides. For example, if you ran the self-extracting file from the
  TEST directory on drive D, and your gateway disk is located in drive A, type
  the following commands:

  " copy d:\test\install.exe a: " (without the quotation marks)

2. Follow the installation steps as outlined in the Microsoft Mail Gateway to
  MHS "Administrator's Guide."
