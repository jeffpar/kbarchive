- Microsoft Complete Basketball for Windows '94-'95 edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When running Complete Basketball with low memory, one of the following problems
may occur:

- The color in the Change Player pop-up may change (for instance, green instead
  of blue), except in places where text is printed.

- The color in other applications may change.

- Selecting a player from the Players screen may or may not work; if it does
  not work, you may need to press CTRL+ALT+DEL to return to Basketball to close
  it.

- The following error message may occur:

  "Resource 'DIBbasicbg' bad or missing. Click OK to continue, or click Cancel
  to close Complete Baseball."

- Other error messages may occur such as:

  "Low on memory, please close other applications."

- When starting Basketball you may get the following message

  "Cannot open File '&lt;filename&gt;'. Please make sure the Complete NBA
  Basketball CD is in the drive, and then click OK to try again, or click
  Cancel to close Complete NBA Basketball."

  where &lt;filename&gt; is the name of the file Basketball is trying to open.

- If you try to change to the Almanac section (which has an AVI movie in its
  first screen), the movie may not appear and the caption may display at the
  top of the screen. No error message is given.

- The Basketball program may run very slowly.

RESOLUTION
==========

Do the following to correct the problem:

1. Close any applications currently running in Windows.

2. Verify that the FILES= line in the CONFIG.SYS file is set to at least 60. For
  example:

  FILES=60

3. Exit Windows and restart.

4. Clean boot your system. For additional information, query on the following
