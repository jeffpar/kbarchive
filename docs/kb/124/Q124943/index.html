-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Musical Instruments for Windows, version 1.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The print command in Musical Instruments results in a black and white image,
even though the printer you are using supports color.

If you copy the image into another application, it still prints in gray scale
only.

CAUSE
=====

The pictures in Musical Instruments are Device Independent Bitmap (.Dib) images.
Some printers will not print these images in color.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use one of the following methods to print color pictures from Microsoft Musical
Instruments.

Method 1
--------

If you have a graphics program that directly supports .Dib images, you may be
able to print in color by copying the image to the Windows Clipboard, then
pasting it into a graphics program. In this case, the graphics program assumes
control of printing.

To copy the Musical Instruments picture, on the menu bar click Options, and then
click Copy. To Paste the picture into a graphics program, refer to the
documentation for that program.

Method 2
--------

To paste color pictures from Musical Instruments into programs that understand
Device Independent Bitmaps (for example, Microsoft Word for Windows, version
6.0) copy the screen to the clipboard using the following steps:

1. Locate the picture in Musical Instruments you want to print.

2. Press and hold down the ALT key while you press the PRINT SCREEN key
  (ALT+PRINT SCREEN).

3. Start the destination program and paste the picture into a document. For
  program-specific pasting instructions, see the documentation that came with
  the application.

NOTE: The Microsoft Windows 3.x Write and Paintbrush programs and the Microsoft
Windows 95 Paint program do not support the printing of color .Dib pictures
pasted from Musical Instruments.


MORE INFORMATION
================

According to the Musical Instruments Readme.txt file, "you should be able to
print gray scale images." It also states that printing in color is only
"possible." Although Windows 3.x Write and Paintbrush, and Windows 95 Paint will
not print these images in color. Other graphics programs may be able to paste
the image and print in color.
