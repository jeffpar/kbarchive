SYMPTOMS
========

When a backup set transaction exceeds the first backup tape's capacity, Windows
NT Backup (NTBACKUP.EXE) asks you to insert a second backup tape. If you cancel
this request, any future attempts to restore files from the tape will fail when
the restore operation requests the second tape (which was never created).

CAUSE
=====

Since Windows NT Backup does not know how many volumes, directories and files
will be backed up in a set when the backup begins, a special indicator at the
end of the backup set shows that there is no more backup data associated with
the set. The indicator also contains information that is not available until the
backup is completed, such as the number of corrupt files backed up and
information about the on tape catalog (OTC). OTCs are designed to store
information about a tape family's data sets, and the objects in a given data
set, in a readily accessible location. If the OTC is missing the standard
restore action fails because it relies on the OTC to restore data.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem run NTBACKUP with the /MISSINGTAPE parameter.

The /MISSINGTAPE parameter causes Windows NT Backup to scan the entire family of
tapes in order to get data set information. For more information on this
parameter, see the Windows NT Backup help file.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The OTC system is slower than a disk based catalog system because the tape has
to be scanned for the OTC, and the contents have to be read. However, the OTC
system is more convenient because it always accompanies the data it refers to
and does not occupy the fixed disk space required by disk based catalogs.
