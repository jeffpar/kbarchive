The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 2.1, 3.0, 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

This article describes how the Microsoft Mail Group Import program, GIMPORT.EXE,
can be used to automate the process of creating Mail Postoffice Address List
Groups. These groups can contain local postoffice users, external postoffice
users, and certain gateway users.

GIMPORT.EXE is a utility that is available as part of the "Database Maintenance
Utilities" document. This document describes operational details for utilities
used to repair and maintain the database for Microsoft Mail for PC Networks. The
procedures described apply to versions 2.1 and later of Microsoft Mail except
where noted.

To obtain the document containing the Database Maintenance Utilities, please see
the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q99419 PC DB: Database Maintenance Utilities (Complete)

MORE INFORMATION
================

GIMPORT.EXE can create groups based on information in an input text file. The
format of this input file is very similar to that used with the IMPORT.EXE
program that ships with Microsoft Mail. For more information on the format of
this file, please refer to the documentation on GIMPORT.EXE available with the
Database Maintenance Utilities. The GIMPORT.EXE input file can be created
manually or can be automatically created by the GIMPORT.EXE program by
extracting the group information from a Microsoft Mail postoffice.

The following steps show how groups created by Mail Administrator can be
replicated into other Mail postoffices. This is especially useful when trying to
create groups spanning multiple postoffices. The example used in the steps shows
how to create groups on postoffice A and replicate them to postoffice B.
(Postoffice A is on drive M, and postoffice B is on drive N.)

NOTE: Before proceeding, it is recommended that you read the information on
GIMPORT.EXE available in Q99419.

1. Create the groups for postoffice A you wish to replicate to postoffice B.
  From Mail Administrator, select Local-Admin, Group, Create. Select the users
  you wish to add to the group and enter the group name and group address.

  NOTE: To add external postoffice or gateway users to a group, you need to
  first add these users to the postoffice Address List by selecting Address,
  Create.

2. Use GIMPORT.EXE to extract the group information. Type the following command
  at the MS-DOS prompt

  " gimport -dm &lt;admin&gt; -p&lt;password&gt; -f&lt;groups.ext&gt; -x
  -i&lt;grpusers.dat&gt; " (without the quotation marks)

  where:

   - &lt;admin&gt; is a Microsoft Mail mailbox with administrative privileges
     on postoffice A.

   - &lt;password&gt; is the password for the &lt;admin&gt; account.

   - &lt;groups.ext&gt; is the name of a text file that will be created by the
     GIMPORT.EXE program containing the group information.

   - &lt;grpusers.dat&gt; is the name of a file that will contain only the
     names of the members of all the groups extracted. This file is for use
     with the IMPORT.EXE program.

  In case you wish to extract information for only certain groups, replace the
  -X in the above command with -X&lt;GRPNAMES.INP&gt; where
  &lt;GRPNAMES.INP&gt; is a text file that contains the full (friendly) names
  of the groups you wish to extract. You must create this file yourself and
  place each name you want included on a separate line.

3. To replicate the users in the groups extracted from postoffice A to the
  Postoffice Address List on postoffice B, type the following command at an
  MS-DOS prompt

  " import -dn &lt;admin&gt; -p&lt;password&gt; -f&lt;grpusers.dat&gt; -a "
  (without the quotation marks)

  where:
   - &lt;admin&gt; is a Microsoft Mail mailbox with administrative privileges
     on postoffice B.

   - &lt;password&gt; is the password for the &lt;admin&gt; account.

   - &lt;grpusers.dat&gt; is the file created in Step 2.

4. Replicate the groups into postoffice B by typing the following command at an
  MS-DOS prompt.

  " gimport -dn &lt;admin&gt; -p&lt;password&gt; -f&lt;groups.ext&gt; "
  (without the quotation marks)

The groups created on postoffice A should now be available in the Postoffice
Address List on postoffice B. The groups will not be visible in the Global
Address List until after the REBUILD.EXE program is run. If you have automatic
Directory Synchronization configured, REBUILD.EXE will be automatically run the
next time your directories are synchronized.
