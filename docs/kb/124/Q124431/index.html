-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you install Windows NT 3.5 over Windows NT 3.1, SNMP traps are not received
by your network agent. If you have access to a network monitor or sniffer, you
can see the traps being sent to the wrong port.

CAUSE
=====

Under Windows NT 3.1, builds 511 and 528, the entry in the SERVICES file for
SNMP-TRAP was set (incorrectly) to port 167. The SERVICES file under Windows NT
3.5 has the entry for SNMP-TRAP correctly set to port 162. The SERVICES file is
copied only if the file does not already exist when you upgrade to Windows NT
3.5. Since it exists from the Windows NT 3.1 installation, the new SERVICES file
with the corrected port number is not copied.

This was not a problem under Windows NT 3.1 is because SNMP did not look in the
SERVICES file to determine which port to use. The SNMP that ships with Windows
3.5 does look in the SERVICES file to determine which port to use for sending
SNMP traps.

RESOLUTION
==========

Edit the SERVICES file in the %SYSTEMROOT%\SYSTEM32\DRIVERS\ETC directory and
change the SNMP-TRAP entry from

  snmp-trap         167/udp    snmp

to:

  snmp-trap         162/udp    snmp

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.5. We are
researching this problem and will post new information here in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
