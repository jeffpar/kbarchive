SYMPTOMS
========

You receive an "Unable to find &lt;array name&gt;" dialog when building an
application.

CAUSE
=====

When building an application, it is not uncommon to receive a warning dialog
that indicates that FoxPro was unable to find a particular program, menu, or
report. While the above mentioned are the more common items the Project Manager
has difficulty reconciling, they are also the easiest to correct. The most
deceptive unresolved reference is when the Project Manager cannot resolve a
reference to an array embedded in a report.

RESOLUTION
==========

You can usually use the EXTERNAL command to resolve the issue. However, this is
a compiler command, so it is not effective if the array that couldn't be found
is used as an expression in a report.

NOTE: For more information on the use of the EXTERNAL command, please see the
Microsoft FoxPro "Language Reference."

One way to resolve this issue is to create a dummy procedure or function with the
same name as the array called in the report. This procedure should never be
called and should have no more than a RETURN statement. However, its existence
will make the compiler quit looking for the array inside the report. In any
instance where the array name is used, the FoxPro compiler will assume that the
call is to the dummy procedure and not to an array that exists elsewhere. This
will have no effect on the compiled application and the report will call the
array as expected.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
