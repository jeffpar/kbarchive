Drivers Installed in the Control Panel
--------------------------------------

The following is a list of the drivers installed in the Drivers
section of the Control Panel.

Sound Blaster Pro:

  Creative Sound Blaster Pro 2 Midi Synthesizer
  Creative Sound Blaster Pro Auxiliary Audio
  Creative Sound Blaster Pro Wave and Midi

Sound Blaster 1350:

  Sound Blaster 2.0 Auxiliary  Audio
  Sound Blaster 2.0 Wave and Midi
  Sound Blaster 2.0 Sound

Sound Blaster Pro 2 and the Sound Blaster 16 ASP:

  Sound Blaster 16 Auxiliary Audio
  Sound Blaster 16 Wave and Midi
  Sound Blaster 16 Sound

Sound Blaster 16:

  Voyetra / Sound Blaster SuperSAPI FM Driver
  Creative Sound Blaster 16 Auxiliary Audio
  Creative Sound Blaster 16 Wave and MIDI

WIN.INI Settings
----------------

There are no WIN.INI settings.

SYSTEM.INI Settings
-------------------

 [386Enh]
 Device=vsbpd.386

 [Drivers]
 AUX=sbpaux.drv
 MIDI=sbpfm.drv    or   MIDI=sbp2fm.drv for Sound Blaster Pro 2
 WAVE=sbpsnd.drv
 MIDI1=sbpsnd.drv

 [Sndblst.drv]
 port=             Port, Interrupt, and DMA Channel settings for card
 int=
 dmachannel=

Special Note for Sound Blaster 16 users
---------------------------------------

The Sound Blaster 16 installation adds these drivers to the  SYSTEM.INI:

  [drivers]
  Aux=sb16aux.drv
  MIDI=sb16fm.drv
  MIDI1=sb16snd.drv
  Wave=sb16snd.drv

Sound Blaster 16 adds this section to the SYSTEM.INI

  [sndblst.drv]
  Port=220
  Int=5
  DmaChannel=1
  MidiPort=330
  HDmaChannel=5
  SaveOnExit=0
  Palette=

In some instances, the SNDBLST.DRV section in the SYSTEM.INI may be
empty. This is caused by an incomplete or failed installation of the
Sound Blaster 16 driver software. To reinstall the drivers, exit
Windows, run the INSTALL program from the SB16 directory, and select
"Setup Windows."

MIDI Mapper Settings
--------------------

The MIDI Mapper Name field for the Sound Blaster 16 should be set to SB16
Ext FM. The other Sound Blaster cards should have All FM or Ext FM for the
Name field.

Special Notes on Driver Filenames
---------------------------------

For Sound Blaster 1330, there should not be any drivers listed in the
[Drivers] section of the SYSTEM.INI file that contain a "2" in the
driver name; for example, "sbp2fm.drv" shouldn't be listed. If there
is no bass line when you play the CANYON.MID file, the SBP2FM.DRV is
probably being used instead of SBPFM.DRV. To play CANYON.MID, do the
following:

1. Open the Media Player, which is normally located in the Accessories
  group.

2. Choose MIDI Sequencer from the Device menu.

3. Choose the CANYON.MID file located in the Windows directory and
  choose OK.

4. Choose the Play button.

For earlier Sound Blaster 1600 cards, all drivers listed in the [Drivers]
section of the SYSTEM.INI file will have a "2" in the driver name. Later
Sound Blaster 1600 cards only have one driver file with a "2" in the driver
name (sbp2fm.drv).

The SET BLASTER Entry
---------------------

Specifies the base I/O address, Interrupt number (IRQ), DMA and HDMA
channels for hardware configuration.

Example:

SET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 H5 P330 T6

  A--Specifies the Sound Blaster 16 base I/O port
  I-- Specifies the Interrupt request line
  D-- Specifies the DMA channel
  H-- Specifies the HDMA channel
  P-- Specifies the MPU-401 base I/O port
  T-- Specifies the card type

How to Tell What Type of Card You Have
--------------------------------------

The "T" entry on the Set Blaster line indicates what type of card you
have.

This T Entry       Means you have this card type
------------------------------------------------

T6                 All 16 bit Sound Blaster cards are type 6.
T5                 The 8 bit Pro card is type 5.
T4                 (card #1600) The SB PRO is type 4.
T3                 (card #1350) A parameter of type 3 indicates an old
                              Sound Blaster card
T2                 (card #1330) All 8 bit cards are type 2.

Note that the only way to be absolutely sure of your card type is to open
your computer and look at the card.

Other Sound Blaster Environment Settings
----------------------------------------

SET MIDI=SYNTH:&lt;1 or 2&gt; MAP:&lt;G or E or B&gt;

In the above setting, &lt;1 or 2&gt; specifies the MIDI file format used (1 is an
FM chip, 2 is an MPU-401 port), and &lt;G or E or B&gt; is where the MIDI data is
sent to (G is General MIDI, E is Extended MIDI, and B is Basic MIDI).

SET SOUND=&lt;path&gt;

Specifies the directory location of SB16 drivers and software.
