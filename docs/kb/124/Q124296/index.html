SYMPTOMS
========

If you are logged on to a machine and the system account has run a scheduled
batch job consisting of NET USE commands, you can see the network drive icons in
File Manager. If you attempt to access the drive icons, the following error
message appears:

  Login Failure: The user has not been granted the requested logon type at this
  computer.

For example, an administrator may use the system or other administrative account
to schedule the following batch file to run when another user has logged on to
the workstation:

  atnetuse.cmd
  net use x: \\server\share /user:domain\administrator password

NOTE: You cannot see the drives using NET USE at a command prompt.

CAUSE
=====

Because the administrator has more rights than a typical user, it appears that
the scheduled job should not appear in any form to the user. Although this
appears to be a bug, the situation occurs by design. Since drive letters are
MS-DOS devices, they are global to the system.
