-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS version 3.0 
- Microsoft LAN Manager, version 2.2c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

Two MS-DOS-based network clients ship with Windows NT Server versions 3.5 and
3.51: LAN Manager for MS-DOS and Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS. Microsoft
recommends you use Network Client for MS-DOS unless you are using a remote boot
workstation.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS was derived from Workgroup Add-on for
MS-DOS. Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS differs from Workgroup Add-on for
MS-DOS in the following ways:

- Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS does not include the Microsoft Mail
  client or MS-DOS server functionality included in Workgroup Add-on for
  MS-DOS.

- Unlike Workgroup Add-on for MS-DOS, Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS
  includes the TCP/IP, MS-DLC, and IPX protocols.

Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS differs from Microsoft LAN Manager for MS-DOS
in the following ways:

- Because Microsoft LAN Manager for MS-DOS does not have any upgrade support,
  it is easier to upgrade from Microsoft LAN Manager for MS-DOS to Microsoft
  Network Client for MS-DOS than it is to upgrade to Microsoft LAN Manager for
  MS-DOS.

- Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS does not support remote boot. LAN Manager
  for MS-DOS is the only Microsoft client that supports remote boot.

- The Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS redirectors (both Basic and Full)
  have been optimized to work efficiently with Windows NT 3.5 and 3.51. As a
  result, Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS is faster than Microsoft LAN
  Manager for MS-DOS at connecting to a computer running Microsoft Windows NT.

Both Microsoft Network Client for MS-DOS and Microsoft LAN Manager for MS-DOS:

- Ship with identical MS-DOS TCP/IP protocols.

- Support and include the TCP/IP, NetBEUI, and IPX protocols.

- Support identical DHCP and Windows Internet Name Service (WINS) capabilities.

- Do not include the Microsoft Mail client.
