SUMMARY
=======

A user wishes to send a file to another person, but the file is too large to
send as an e-mail attachment. An alternative is to transmit files via MSN
Messenger, because Messenger does not a place a size limit on transferred files.
However, other limitations exist. Users who are behind firewalls (a Local Area
Network), may not be able to transfer files to anyone outside of their local
network. Also, Messenger file transfers only work if both the user sending the
file and the recipient are online at the same time and both parties are using
MSN Messenger.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To send files using Online Buddies in MSN Explorer

1. Start MSN Explorer.

2. Click the Online Buddies icon.

3. Click the name of the buddy that you wish to send a file to.
  Note: This person must be online and signed in to Messenger.

4. Click the Options link, and then click Send File.

5. Select the file you want to send, and then click the Open button.
  The recipient will be asked if to either accept or decline the file transfer.
  If the recipient accepts, the file transfer will begin. If the recipient
  declines, you will receive a message explaining that the file transfer was
  declined.

To send files if you're using MSN Messenger without MSN Explorer

1. Start MSN Messenger.

2. Click File, and then click Send a file to.
  Any Online Contacts in your list that are currently online will appear.

3. Click the name of the contact that you wish to send a file to.

4. Select the file you want to send, and then click the Open button.
  The recipient will be asked if to either accept or decline the file transfer.
  If the recipient accepts, the file transfer will begin. If the recipient
  declines, you will receive a message explaining that the file transfer was
  declined.
