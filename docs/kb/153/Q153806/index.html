  Q173227 How to Cancel My MSN Account

How can I check or change my MSN account member information?
------------------------------------------------------------

To check your MSN account information, go to the Member Services Web site, at
http://memberservices.msn.com/us/default_accounts.asp and select from the
available choices.

To view or change you name, address, or phone, click Change Address.
To update your credit card information click Change Payment.
To change you password click Change Password.

How can I change my member ID?
------------------------------

Your Member ID is the only means of identifying your account, therefore, to
change it you must create a new account in order to obtain a new Member ID.
Note: This will not replace your existing account. If you want it to replace
your existing account, you must follow the procedures above for cancelling your
MSN account.

To create a new account, follow these steps: To sign up for an additional MSN
account, follow the appropriate steps below.

Internet Explorer 4.0 or earlier

1. Open Internet Explorer, click View, and then click Internet Options.

2. Click the Connection tab, and then click Setup.

Internet Explorer 5.0

1. Open Internet Explorer, click Tools, and then click Internet Options.

2. Click the Connection tab, and then click Setup.

After following these directions the Internet Connection Wizard appears, at which
point you follow the instructions on the screen to continue the process. Once
you have verified that your new account is working properly, you must cancel
your old account (make sure that you sign on using the account you want to
close).

Can I set up two different member IDs for the same account?

-----------------------------------------------------------

This is not currently possible. We are currently looking into a number of billing
options, so we may have this ability in the future. You can create two accounts
and use both from the same computer. All you need to do is type the appropriate
Member ID and password for the account you want to use. Remember that each
account is billed separately.

What should I do if I forget my password?
-----------------------------------------

If you have forgotten the password you use to sign in to MSN or would just like
to change it, you can use one of the options listed below to get help.

Before using one of these options, please make sure you have a pen and the credit
card to which your MSN account is billed (to verify your account information).
If you do not have your credit card, call MSN Member Support at the number
listed below that is nearest you.

To get a list of rules for creating your password, go to Are There Any Rules for
Member IDs or Passwords?

- In the Member Services area of MSN, click Your Account, then click Change
  Password, and then fill in the current and new passwords on the screen that
  appears.

- Call the MSN automated password reset number. Dial one of the numbers listed
  below and follow the step-by-step process for changing your password quickly
  and easily over the phone. (Note: These numbers will work if you have only
  one MSN account associated with the credit card number you enter.)

   - (1) (800) 952-1110 (Canada - English/French)

   - (81) (03) 5977-0196 (Japan, Tokyo)

   - (81) (06) 6535-0196 (Japan, Osaka)

   - (44) (0870) 601-1000 (United Kingdom)

   - (1) (800) 386-5550 (United States)

  Contact MSN Member Support to get help in changing your password.

Are member IDs and passwords case sensitive?
--------------------------------------------

No, member IDs and passwords are not case sensitive.

What areas on MSN are free of connection charges?
-------------------------------------------------

If you are using MSN Internet Access as your Internet Service Provider, then
regular connection charges apply whenever you are connected to the Internet.

NOTE: Charges vary per plan type.

  free online hours associated with the standard subscription plan.

Why did I receive a message stating that my password is not valid when I tried to sign back in after changing my MSN password?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you sign out of MSN, The Microsoft Network, after changing your password and
then attempt to sign back in using your new password, you may receive a message
stating that your password is not valid. Your new password does not take effect
immediately. In most cases, password changes do take effect within a minute or
two, but longer delays are possible. Wait a few minutes and then sign in to MSN
or you can use your old password to get in right away.
