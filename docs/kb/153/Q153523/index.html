SYMPTOMS
========

When an application issues a cmcanc() call with a cmrcv() outstanding, the CPIC
library would release its conversation control block twice. This would cause a
subsequent cminit() call to fail with PRODUCT_SPECIFIC_ERROR(20).

CAUSE
=====

When the application issues the cmcanc() verb the outstanding cmrcv() returns
with the error, CM_DEALLOCATED_ABEND_SVC. At that point the CPIC library frees
the conversation control block. When the cmcanc() verb had finished its
processing, it then frees the conversation control block again. This causes the
CPIC library's count of active conversations to drop to -1. Because the CPI-C
library uses unsigned integers, a negative value of -1 appears as a very large
positive number. When the application now issues the next cminit() call the CPIC
library checks its count of active conversations, and notice that it was greater
than the maximum limit of 16.

With the SNA Application, CPI-C trace enabled you might see the following:

MORE INFORMATION
================

There might be other reasons for getting a PRODUCT_SPECIFIC_ERROR(20) that are
not necessarily be related to this article. Further reasons for getting a
PRODUCT_SPECIFIC_ERROR(20) can be found in the Knowledge Base articles Q132720
and Q148359.

If you should observe this behavior you will also get the error message 3022
logged in the Application Event Log which indicates an attempt to exceed the
maximum number of concurrent CPIC conversations.
