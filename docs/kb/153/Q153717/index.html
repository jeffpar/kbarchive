-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, version 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

The Microsoft Exchange Dynamic RAS Connector might fail to deliver mail over
NetBeui even though the modem connection is established and NetBeui has been
installed on both Microsoft Exchange Server computer's Windows NT RAS
configuration settings.

CAUSE
=====

By default, the Microsoft Exchange Message Transfer Agent (MTA) only supports
the use of Microsoft TCP/IP, IPX/SPX compatible transport, and Banyan Vines IP.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

To enable support for NetBeui over the Dynamic RAS Connector, the following
registry adjustment will need to be made on both Microsoft Exchange Server
computers.

1. Start Regedt32.exe and open the following key:

     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Exchange\Exchange Provider

2. On the RPC_SVR_BINDING_ORDER registry entry add the following value:

     NCACN_NB_NB

Make sure this setting is entered on both Microsoft Exchange Servers so that they
will have a common protocol. After the change is made, stop and re-start the
MSExchangeMTA service.

It is important to note that the MTA reads the RPC_SVR_BINDING_ORDER in a serial
manner, so the placement of the protocols can effect how the MTA functions. If
the NCACN_NB_NB value is first in the order, the MTA will attempt to use NetBeui
first. If it is last, the MTA will read through all the other values
sequentially. What this means is that if NetBeui and TCP/IP are both loaded, and
the NCACN_NB_NB value is last in the binding order, TCP/IP will be used. This is
only important in environments where there are mixed protocols and/or adapters.

CAUTION: Using only the NetBeui protocol with the Microsoft Exchange Dynamic RAS
Connector may cause delays in modem disconnect times with certain modems and/or
telco line conditions. This is due to a limitation in the NetBeui protocol. If
such symptoms are encountered, we recommend that an additional protocol such as
TCP/IP also be installed.
