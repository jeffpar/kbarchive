-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.51 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.51 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SUMMARY
=======

The Windows NT TCP/IP printing support has been modified to encompass greater
functionality then what was available with prior releases. Modifications were
made in three separate areas:

- Improved System V support

- Support for multiple data files per control file

- Improved TCP/IP output when spooling a high number of jobs

MORE INFORMATION
================

Improved System V Support
-------------------------

Windows NT version 3.5x supported TCP/IP printing as documented in RFC1179.
However, this RFC "describes an existing print server protocol widely used on
the Internet for communicating between line printer daemons," and does not
specify an Internet standard. Different implementations support different
options, so due to popular demand, enhancements were added for Windows NT.

Support for Multiple Data Files per Control File
------------------------------------------------

Windows NT supports multiple data files per control file, and when used in "print
through" mode as an intermediate spooler, it correctly passes the hostname
parameter through the Windows printing subsystem.

Improved TCP/IP Output When Spooling a High Number of Jobs
----------------------------------------------------------

Prior to Windows NT 3.51 Service Pack (SP) 5, all TCP/IP print jobs sent from a
Windows NT computer were sourced from TCP ports 721 through 731, and if many
jobs were sent in quick succession the ports could be "used up," causing a pause
in printing until one of them passed through the TCP TIME_WAIT state. This has
been modified for Service Pack 5, and now line printer remote (LPR) jobs are
sourced from any available reserved port between 512 and 1023.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. This
problem was corrected in the latest Windows NT 3.51 U.S. Service Pack. For
