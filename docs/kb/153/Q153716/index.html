SUMMARY
=======

In order to perform full administration of a Windows NT Remote Access Service
(RAS) server, you must be an Administrator or a member of both the Server
Operators and Account Operators groups.

MORE INFORMATION
================

To fully administer a RAS server in a domain, you must use a user account that
is a member of the Domain Administrators group, or you must use a user account
that is a member of both the Server Operators and Account Operators groups.

A user in the Server Operators group is able to start and stop the RAS Server
service, disconnect RAS clients, and send messages to connected RAS clients. A
user who is only a member of the Server Operators group cannot grant or revoke
RAS dial-in permission to a user account.

A user in the Account Operators group is able to grant and revoke RAS dial-in
permission to a user account. A user who is only a member of the Account
Operators group cannot start and stop the RAS Server service, disconnect RAS
clients, or send messages to connected RAS clients.

A user who is a member of both the Server Operators group and Account Operators
group has the same administrative abilities regarding a RAS server as a user who
is a member of the Domain Administrators group.

To perform any administration of a RAS server on a Windows NT Workstation or
Windows NT stand-alone server using a local machine account, the account must be
a member of the local Administrators group.
