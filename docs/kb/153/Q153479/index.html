-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 4.0, 5.0, 5.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

By default, only the recipients from your Exchange Server site are listed in
your offline Address Book. This article describes how an Exchange Server
administrator can include all of the recipients from the global address list in
the offline Address Book.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you install Exchange Server, there is only one recipients container, called
the Recipients container, in the first site. By default, this Recipients
container is the only entry in the list of Address Books. (In the DS Site
Configuration properties, click the Offline Address Book tab to see the list of
Address Books.)

Exchange Server builds the offline Address Book (based on a configurable
schedule) from this list of Address Books, so by default, the offline Address
Book only contains the recipients that are listed in the default Recipients
container of a site. To generate an offline Address Book that contains all of
the users in the global address list, perform the following steps:

1. Start the Exchange Server Administrator program.

2. In the left pane, click the Configuration container for the site that you
  want to change.

3. In the right pane, double-click the DS Site Configuration object. The DS Site
  Configuration Properties dialog box is displayed.

4. Click the Offline Address Book tab.

5. Perform one of the following sets of steps, as applicable:

   - For Exchange Server version 4.0:

     a. Under "Generate Data Files From the Address Book Container", click
        Modify.

     b. In the Offline Address Book Container window, click the Global Address
        List container, and then click OK. The Generate Data Files From The
        Address Book Container box changes to Global Address List.

   - For Exchange Server versions 5.0 and 5.5:

     a. Click Add.

     b. In the Offline Address Book Container window, click the Global Address
        List container, and then click OK. The Address Book Container box adds
        the Global Address List.

6. Click Generate Offline Address Book Now to generate a new offline Address
  Book that contains all of the recipients available in the Exchange Server
  organization.

7. Click OK.

After you perform these steps, downloads of the offline Address Book contain all
of the recipients from the global address list.
