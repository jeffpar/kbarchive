SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT clients using TCP/IP may notice a considerable delay resuming data
transfer to client applications that take a long time to clear the TCP/IP
receive window.

A Protocol Analyzer trace of the slow performance will show the following
behavior:

1. The server sends a large data transfer.

2. The client runs out of receive windows space and indicates a zero-byte
  window.

3. The server enters exponential backoff until it hits the maximum limit of 240
  seconds between window probe packets. Because the time between probes is
  longer than the 120-second Address Resolution Packet (ARP) cache life, each
  new window probe now requires that the server ARP for the client's Media
  Access Control (MAC) address.

4. The client clears its receive window and advertises additional window space.

5. The server begins transmitting data with an incorrect sequence number.

6. The client acknowledges a previous data send.

7. The server takes up to four minutes to send the correct sequence number.

CAUSE
=====

The server falls out of sequence because its window probes are 240 seconds apart
so the server has to ARP for the client's MAC address when the client advertises
its new window space. The reason this causes the server to fall out of sequence
is that the server begins sending data immediately after discovering that the
client has additional window space. Because the ARP table entry for the client
is in the resolving state when the server starts indicating data, TCP/IP cannot
send the data to the client.

In accordance with RFC the ARP cache will only buffer one packet when the
destination IP address is in the resolving state. Windows NT buffers the last
packet only, so all sends, except for the last, are dropped until the ARP entry
has been resolved. When the ARP entry for the client is resolved TCP/IP sends
the last packet that was cached to the client; the packet is out of sequence
because the prior sends were dropped while the ARP entry was resolving. The
excessive delay that occurs is caused by the server's taking 240 seconds to send
the correct sequence number.

The reason the server takes 240 seconds to send the correct sequence number is
that a retransmit timer has started running. The retransmit timer takes 240
seconds to complete before the packet with the correct sequence number can be
sent.

Note: For additional information on the ARP cache please refer to

  RFC 1122.
