-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Macintosh, version 3.0b 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When using SET MACDESKTOP OFF, user-defined windows are confined to the limits
of the Visual FoxPro screen. This is analogous to the application window in
Visual FoxPro for Windows. However, the Properties sheet and Project Manager are
special elements of the Visual FoxPro development environment and are handled
differently. There are situations where the Properties sheet or Project Manager
may not behave consistently with other windows in respect to SET MACDESKTOP OFF.
This may result in the Properties sheet or Program Manager being obscured by the
Visual FoxPro Screen.

CAUSE
=====

Properties Sheet:

This limitation is a result of the Properties sheet being shared by multiple
windows, and the need to guarantee its accessibility to all designers. For
instance, if one designer is activated IN MACDESKTOP and another is not, there
may be a chance for the Properties sheet to be hidden when using the designer.

Project Manager:

This behavior is due to the hybrid sense of the Project Manager. It shares
behavior with both toolbars and windows. Therefore, if the Project Manager were
confined to the Visual FoxPro Screen, it would not be dockable.

WORKAROUND
==========

1. Use the configuration file special setting MACSCREEN = OFF or SET MACDESKTOP
  ON, then close the Visual FoxPro screen.

2. Use the pushpin on the Properties sheet to secure it at the topmost level.

3. Dock the Project Manager, or tear off a tab and use the pushpin to bring it
  forward.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps to Reproduce Problem
--------------------------

Properties sheet:

1. SET MACDESKTOP OFF.

2. Modify a new or existing form.

3. Open the properties sheet and unpin it, making sure that the sheet overlaps
  the Visual FoxPro Screen.

4. Click on the Visual FoxPro Screen, causing it to come forward.

  The Properties sheet will fall behind the Visual FoxPro Screen, even though
  the MACDESKTOP is set to OFF.

Project Manager:

1. SET MACDESKTOP OFF.

2. Modify a new or existing project.

3. Make sure the project is not docked and partially overlaps the Visual FoxPro
  Screen.

4. Click on the Visual FoxPro Screen, causing it to come forward.

  The Project Manager will fall behind the Visual FoxPro Screen, even though
  MACDESKTOP is set to OFF.
