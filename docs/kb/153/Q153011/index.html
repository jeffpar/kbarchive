SUMMARY
=======

In order to connect a host to the Internet, you must register a domain name with
the InterNIC. The InterNIC is responsible for registering top second level
domains EDU, ORG, GOV, COM, and NET. This article outlines procedures and
considerations for the registration process.

MORE INFORMATION
================

InterNIC Registrations Services is provided by Network Solutions Inc. After
choosing potential domain names, you can use the WHOIS program to verify that
the domain is available. To use WHOIS, connect to http://www.internic.net/
through a World Wide Web browser. For additional information about methods of
verifying domain names, please see the following article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q151710 Using WHOIS To Research Internet Domains

After a domain name is selected, it should be entered into at least two domain
name servers. The first two servers are known as the primary DNS and secondary
DNS servers and are the authoritative servers for resolving hosts for the
domain. Other hosts that wish to connect with the domain will query these
servers to resolve a host name to an IP address. Any additional servers that
contain domain information will act as backups. While the InterNIC requires
existing domain servers to list the new domain before it becomes propagated to
the Internet, it is possible to reserve a domain name first.

After the DNS entries are performed, an application is submitted to the InterNIC
along with payment for the registration. Currently, new registrations are $100
for two years and renewals are $50 per year. Check with the InterNIC for current
pricing.

The easiest way to submit a registration application is through the World Wide
Web using the InterNIC home page listed above. The following information is
requested on the application:

1. Requested domain name.

2. Contact Names. These include administrative, technical, zone, and billing
  contacts.

3. Organization Details including name, address, and phone number.

4. Primary and secondary DNS server names and host addresses.

After you submit the application, the registration system will assign a tracking
and invoice number. The status of the registration can be tracked via e-mail or
the World Wide Web. Once the registration is complete, the domain name will be
propagated to top level name servers and Internet hosts will be able to connect
to machines on the new domain.
