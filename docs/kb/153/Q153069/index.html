MORE INFORMATION
================

Before Contacting MSN Member Support
------------------------------------

If you are unable to connect to MSN, follow these steps before contacting MSN
Member Support. After performing each step, check to see if you are able to
connect to MSN.

1. Verify that Windows 95 is configured to use the correct modem settings for
  connecting to MSN. To modify the modem settings used when you connect to MSN,
  use the right mouse button to click the MSN icon on the desktop, click
  Connection Settings on the menu that appears, and then click Modem Settings.
  Do not double-click the Modems icon in Control Panel to modify the modem
  settings used when you connect to MSN.

2. If your modem is a Hayes-compatible modem and the Install New Modem Wizard
  detected it as a standard modem type, remove the standard modem and install a
  Hayes-compatible modem. To do so, follow these steps:

  A. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.

  B. Double-click Modems.

  C. Click the standard modem, and then click Remove.

  D. Click Add, click the Don't detect my modem; I will select it from a list
  check box to select it, and then click Next.

  E. In the Manufacturers box, click Hayes. In the Models box, click Hayes
  Compatible 9600 or Hayes Compatible 2400, and then click Next.

  F. Follow the instructions in the Install New Modem Wizard to finish
  installing the Hayes-compatible modem.

3. Right-click the MSN icon on the desktop, click Connection Settings, click
  Help, and then follow the instructions in the MSN Sign-up And Access
  Troubleshooter to help troubleshoot the problem.

4. If you are trying to sign up and you are unable to connect to MSN, you may be
  located in an area that is not supported by the toll-free telephone number
  that is used during sign-up. When this is the case, sign-up attempts to
  connect to MSN several times, and then displays the Connection Settings
  dialog box. If this occurs, click Access Numbers, and then specify different
  primary and backup access numbers. After doing so, try to sign up again.

If you still cannot connect to MSN after performing the above steps, contact MSN
Member Support.
