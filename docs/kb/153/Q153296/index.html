-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation versions 3.51, 4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0, Terminal Server Edition 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

If your computer supports the shut down and power down feature, you may
experience one of the following problems:

- CHKDSK runs as your computer starts and reports a dirty volume.

- A blue screen appears and displays the following message:

  STOP 0x0000007B (parameter, parameter, parameter, parameter)
  INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE

CAUSE
=====

Recent versions of IDE/ATAPI hard disk drives include a write cache. This cache
is normally flushed automatically depending on an algorithm by the hard disk
manufacturer. On computers that support the shut down and power down feature,
the power may turn off before the write cache is flushed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Windows NT 4.0
--------------

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Windows NT 4.0 or
Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. For additional information,
please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q152734 How to Obtain the Latest Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack


For your convenience, the English version of this post-SP3 hotfix has been posted
to the following Internet location. However, Microsoft recommends that you
install Windows NT 4.0 Service Pack 4 to correct this problem.

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/NT40/hotfixes-postSP3/ide-fix

Windows NT 3.51
---------------

To resolve this, apply the fix mentioned below or wait for the next service
pack.

This hotfix has been posted to the following Internet location:

  ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/bussys/winnt/winnt-public/fixes/usa/NT351/hotfixes-postSP5/ide-fix

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows NT
Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition. This problem was first corrected in Windows
NT 4.0 Service Pack 4.0 and Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition
Service Pack 4.


Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT version 3.51. A
supported fix is now available, but has not been fully regression-tested and
should be applied only to systems experiencing this specific problem. Unless you
are severely impacted by this specific problem, Microsoft recommends that you
wait for the next Service Pack that contains this fix. Contact Microsoft
Technical Support for more information.


MORE INFORMATION
================

The IDE/ATAPI specification does not define a command to determine if a write
cache is present or to explicitly flush the cache. The Windows NT file system
drivers modify the boot sector on startup to indicate a dirty volume. On shut
down, the last operation is to modify the boot sector again to mark the volume
clean. This last write is cached in the cache of the disk. If the power is
removed too early, this sector is not written at all and the volume is still
marked dirty. If the power disappears during the physical write to the disk, the
boot sector is corrupt and the blue screen occurs.
