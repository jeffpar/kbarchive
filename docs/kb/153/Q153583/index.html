SUMMARY
=======

You might think that you could change the letter case of a control name by
changing the value of the Name property of the control in the Property Browser.
However, this does not work. This article shows you how to do it.

MORE INFORMATION
================

By design, the letter case of a variable as designated when dimensioning it will
be the letter case throughout the project. For example, type the following
inside a code window:

     Dim MyVariable as string
     myvariable = "hello"     ' will be changed to MyVariable = "hello"

To change the letter case of a variable, you must change its letter case within
the dimension statement. Therefore, in the previous example, to change
MyVariable to Myvariable, type the following:

     Dim Myvariable as String

You can use this fact to change the letter case of a control's name. Just
dimension a variable of the desired name and case. After you press ENTER, the
case will change throughout the code window. Then simply delete the unnecessary
dimension statement.

The following shows how to change the case of Command1 to command1 by a
step-by-step example:

Step-by-step example
--------------------

1. Start a new project in Visual Basic 4.0. Form1 will be added by default.

2. Add a command button on Form1.

3. Add the following line of code to the Form_Click Event:

     Command1.Caption = "hello"

4. Add the following line of code to the Form_Click event and press ENTER.

     Dim command1 as string

5. The case should now be as just entered, or:

     command1.Caption = "hello"

6. Delete the following line of code from the Form_Click event now that it is no
  longer needed:

     Dim command1 as string
