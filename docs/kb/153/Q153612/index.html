-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

message:

  A required .DLL file, WSOCK32.DLL, was not found.

CAUSE
=====

If Wsock32.dll is located anywhere other than in your Windows System folder, or
if it is not installed on the computer, you will receive the above error
message.

RESOLUTION
==========

The following steps describe how to resolve this problem if Wsock32.dll is in
the wrong location:

1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, and click Explorer.

2. Double-click My Computer, and use the right mouse button to click Find.

3. In the Named box, type "Wsock32.dll" (without the quotation marks) and click
  Find Now.

4. If Wsock32.dll is located anywhere other than in the Windows System folder,
  move the file into the Windows System folder.

  For more information on how to move files, view the following Help topics in
  Windows 95: moving, files or folders.

5. Restart the computer.

If Wsock32.dll Is Missing
-------------------------

If Wsock32.dll is missing from the computer, then extract the file from the
Windows 95 compact disc or the Windows 95 floppy disks. The following steps
describe how to resolve this problem if Wsock32.dll is missing or has not been
installed on your computer:

Compact Disc:

1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, and then click MS-DOS Prompt.

2. Type "extract /L c:\&lt;windows&gt;\system d:\win95\win95_11.cab wsock32.dll"
  (without the quotation marks), where C is the drive on which Windows 95 is
  installed, Windows is the directory in which Windows 95 is installed, and D
  is your CD-ROM drive. (Make the appropriate changes if your system differs.)

  NOTE: Wsock32.dll may be in win95_12.cab if you are extracting the file off of
  the Windows 95 compact disc. In this case, type:

  extract /L c:\&lt;windows&gt;\system d:\win95\win95_12.cab

3. Type "exit" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER to close the MS-DOS
  Prompt.

4. Click the Start button, click Shutdown, click Restart The Computer, and then
  click Yes.

3.5-inch Disks:

1. Click the Start button, point to Programs, and then click MS-DOS Prompt.

2. Use the command that corresponds to the type of disks you have:

  a. If you have DMF disks, type "extract /L c:\&lt;windows&gt;\system
     a:\win95_12.cab wsock32.dll" (without the quotation marks), where C is the
     drive on which Windows 95 is installed, where Windows is the folder in
     which Windows 95 is installed, and where A is your floppy disk drive.

  b. If you have non-DMF disks, type "extract /L c:\&lt;windows&gt;\system
     a:\win95_19.cab wsock32.dll" (without the quotation marks), where C is the
     drive on which Windows 95 is installed, where Windows is the folder in
     which Windows 95 is installed, and where A is your floppy disk drive.

3. Type "exit" (without the quotation marks) and press ENTER to close the MS-DOS
  Prompt.

4. Click the Start button, click Shutdown, click Restart The Computer, and then
  click Yes.
