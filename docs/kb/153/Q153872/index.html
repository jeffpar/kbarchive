The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Windows, versions 4.0a, 5.0, 6.0 
- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 16-bit, for Windows, version 4.0 
- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe, 32-bit, for Windows 4.0 
- Microsoft Visual SourceSafe for Macintosh, versions 4.0a, 5.0

SUMMARY
=======

Ddconv.exe is the utility that converts a SourceSafe 3.x database to 4.0, 4.0a,
or 5.0 format. The setup process automatically runs it when you upgrade. When
run, it puts a log file called ddcerr.log in the DATA subdirectory. This file
lets the user know what has happened during the conversion.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The ideal ddcerr.log file has only the following ten lines in it:

  DDCONV initializing
  Creating subfolders
  Moving files
  Creating rights DB
  Building project list
  Creating names DB
  Converting log files
  Adding project rights
  Converting users
  DDCONV finished

The following conventions are used in the messages below:

  &lt;Physical Log File Name&gt; is the file in the DATA directory without an
  extension, such as BKAAAAAA.

  &lt;Physical Data File Name&gt; is the file in the DATA directory with an
  extension of .A or .B, such as BKAAAAAA.a.

  &lt;Project Name&gt; is the name of the project in the Visual SourceSafe
  interface, such as $/MyProject/Sub-Project.

  &lt;File Name&gt; is the name of the file in the Visual SourceSafe
  interface,such as MyFile.txt

  # is a number, such as 1.

How To Identify a File from its Physical Log File Name
------------------------------------------------------

You can open the physical log file in a text editor and look at the non- garbage
characters. On the first line, the name of the file/project is written. Later in
the file you might see a reference to a project that this file or project is in.
Don't write anything to this file!!

The following four messages may appear in the file and can be considered
harmless:

  &lt;File Name&gt;
  &lt;Physical Log File Name&gt; parent project &lt;Project Name&gt; not found,
  skipping parent record.


  &lt;File Name&gt;
  &lt;Physical Log File Name&gt; Parent count in old DB #, correcting to actual
  count #.


  &lt;Project Name&gt;
  &lt;Physical Log File Name&gt; Project entry count in old DB #, correcting to
  actual count #.


  &lt;Project Name&gt;
  &lt;Physical Log File Name&gt; Format record, invalid, correcting.


If the following messages appear in the file, the conversion process did not
successfully convert every file in the DATA directory:

  &lt;File Name&gt;
  Error converting header in logfile &lt;Physical Log File Name&gt;.

This file was not able to be converted because of corruption in the header of the
file. If the file is needed, recover the 3.1 database, then fix it and retry the
conversion. Be sure you have run the 3.1 analyze on the 3.1 database. If the
file is not needed, move the log file and the data file (BKAAAAAA and
BKAAAAAA.a) out of the DATA directory, and run the new analyze with the -F
switch to clean up the links to the file. This may take more than one run of
analyze -F &lt;Path to Data&gt;.

For more information, please see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge
Base:

  Q190881 SAMPLE: Analyze6.exe Utility for Visual SourceSafe


  Unable to open project &lt;Physical Log File Name&gt;.
  Unable to open file &lt;Physical Log File Name&gt;.

The file was locked when the conversion process was running. Unlock the file at
the operating system level and re-run ddconv on the half-converted database. You
don't have to recover the 3.1 data.


  &lt;Project Name&gt;
  File &lt;Physical Log File Name&gt; not found.
  File &lt;Physical Data File Name&gt; not found.

The file mentioned is not found in the data subdirectory. You need to determine
what file this is referring to and decide whether you need it or not. If you
need it, and it is a physical log file, you have to go to backups. If it is the
physical data file name of a project, you can run the new analyze -F &lt;path to
data&gt; on it. This may take more than one run of analyze -F &lt;Path to
Data&gt;. If it is the physical data file of a file, then you need to recover
from backups or someone's working directory. However, it should be noted that
there is no guarantee that the recovered copy is the correct one. Having the
incorrect one would mean that all previous versions of the file would be
retrieved incorrectly.


  Error converting project entry records in file &lt;Physical Log File
  Name&gt;.

Run the new analyze -F &lt;Path to Data&gt; to clean up. You may need to run it
several times.


  &lt;Physical Data File Name&gt; Eliminating duplicate name &lt;File Name&gt;
  in child list.

This message occurs when there is an active file/project with the same name as a
deleted file. Ideally, the 3.1 database would be recovered, and then either the
deleted file would be purged or the active file would be renamed. And then
ddconv would be run on the 3.1 data again. Otherwise, the new analyze can be run
with the -F switch on the database which may be able to re-establish the links,
but it might have to be run several times.


  Cannot find physical project file for &lt;Project Name&gt;.

This message occurs when there is an active project with the same name as a
deleted project. Ideally, the 3.1 database would be recovered, and then either
the deleted project would be purged or the active project would be renamed. And
then ddconv would be run on the data again. Otherwise the new analyze can be run
with the -F switch on the database which may be able to re-establish the links,
but it might have to be run several times.


  Error writing to file.

This message occurs because ddconv could not upgrade the file. Frequent reasons
for this are:

There is an operating system lock on the file. Remove it and re-run ddconv on the
half converted database.

The file is zero byte count. Recover from backup. Or if it is both the log file
and the data file (BKAAAAAA and BKAAAAAA.a) are zero byte count, move the files
out of the DATA directory, and then run the new analyze with the -F switch to
remove the links. Analyze -F &lt;Path to Data&gt; might have to be run several
times to clear up the links.

  Too Many File Handles open.

Another process in memory is affected the conversion process. Remove the TSR from
memory or close the application.
