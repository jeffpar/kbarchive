SYMPTOMS
========

When the Setup Wizard is used to generate a setup program for an OLE DLL, the
DLL will not be registered correctly when the setup program is used. This
problem does not occur if the Setup Wizard is used to generate a program for an
OLE automation client and the OLE server DLL is included in Step 4 of the Setup
Wizard.

WORKAROUND
==========

The Setup Wizard generates a SETUP.LST file for each set of installation media
it generates. This file is used to determine which files to copy, where to copy
them, and how they can be registered, among other things. The SETUP.LST file can
be modified to cause the Setup Wizard-generated program to correctly register
the DLL upon installation.

After generating setup media with the Setup Wizard, open the SETUP.LST file with
a text editor such as Notepad. The line that refers to the DLL file will look
something like this (all on one line):

     File2=1,,DS.dl_,DS.dll,$(CommonFiles)\OleSvr,,$(Shared),2/19/1996,10240,
     1.0.0.0

To cause the DLL to be registered properly when installed, simply add the text
'$(DLLSelfRegister)' between the correct set of commas, so that the line now
looks like this:

     File2=1,,DS.dl_,DS.dll,$(CommonFiles)\OleSvr,$(DLLSelfRegister),$(Shared
     ),2/19/1996,10240,1.0.0.0

The setup program will now know to register the DLL file after it has been copied
to the hard drive.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be an issue in the Microsoft products listed at
the beginning of this article. Microsoft is researching this problem and will
post new information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes
available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Steps To Reproduce
------------------

1. Start Visual Basic, and open the DS sample project
  (vb\samples\oleserv\ds.vbp). Compile an OLE DLL from the code by selecting
  'Make OLE DLL File...' from the File menu. Save the changes.

2. Start the Visual Basic Setup Wizard. In step 1, select the project file for
  the DS sample. This will cause the check box below the text field to change
  to 'Rebuild the Project's DLL File.'

3. Follow through the steps, ensuring that 'Install as OLE automation shared
  component' is selected in Step 6. Click Finish to let the Setup Wizard
  generate the setup files for the DLL.

4. On the same machine that was used to generate the setup disks, unregister the
  DS.DLL file. This can be done by running REGSVR32 with a -u switch:

  REGSVR32 -u DS.DLL

5. Run the SETUP.EXE generated in step 3 and install the DLL.

6. Start Visual Basic and select References from the Tools menu. Observe that
  'Demonstration OLE Server' is not listed in the references because it was not
  registered by the setup program. The problem can be fixed by manually
  registering the DLL (with REGSVR32) or by modifying the SETUP.LST file as
  described above and then rerunning the setup program.
