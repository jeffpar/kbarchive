TITLE: Both LAN Manager and NT domain running Remoteboot cannot coexist

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.5, 3.51 
- Microsoft LAN Manager, versions 2.2b, 2.2c 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a computer running LAN Manager Server and Remoteboot is migrated to a
Windows NT domain with a Windows NT domain controller running Remoteboot (and
the LAN Manager is left on the Windows NT domain), the following symptoms and
subsequent error messages occur:

- The LAN Manager RPL client will fail to boot Error: "NON SYSTEM DISK or DISK
  ERROR"

- The Remoteboot Service on the LAN Manager will fail to start

  Error: "NET 3056 - A system error has occurred."

  Error: "NET 2586 - This server is not configured to support the Remoteboot
  service."

- When you run RPLINST on the LAN Manager it will fail

  Error: "The remoteboot service requires user-level security. Accounts will
  not be updated at this time."

CAUSE
=====

The cause of the problem is that during the migration of the computer running
LAN Manager, the Upgrade for LAN Manager tools creates an RPLUSER global group.
The Upgrade for LAN Manager tools either renames the LAN Manager RPLUSER group
to RPLUSER_OLD or it will allow you to rename the group to a different name
because a Windows NT RPLUSER local group already exists. The new global group is
not functional, causing the LAN Manager RPL clients to fail. When you restart
the LAN Manager Server, the Remoteboot Service will fail to start. If you run
RPLINST against the LAN Manager, it will fail to complete.

RESOLUTION
==========

In the Windows NT 'Installation Guide' it explicitly states "On the Windows NT
Server computer, delete the RPLUSER global group (it is created by the Upgrade
for LAN Manager tools)". Before you delete the RPLUSER global group, you will
have to manually add the users from the RPLUSER global group to the RPLUSER
local group and have the computer running Windows NT Server remoteboot the LAN
Manager RPL clients.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.5 and
3.51. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
