SUMMARY
=======

When you export the directory, only the primary addresses are exported by
default. In order to export all addresses, including the secondary addresses,
the export file (.CSV) should have Secondary-Proxy- Addresses as part of the
header.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Microsoft Exchange Server automatically generates the following e-mail addresses
for the server core components and recipients: MS Mail (PC) address, X.400
address, and SMTP address. These addresses are the primary addresses and are
identified by bold, capitalized text in the E-mail Addresses page.

If needed, you can use the E-mail Addresses property page to add multiple
addresses. These addresses are the secondary addresses and are identified by
regular, lower case text. You can "promote" the secondary address to the primary
address by selecting the address and pressing Set as Reply Address button in the
E-mail Addresses property page.

To export only the primary addresses, you can use the Admin program and either
click Directory Export on the Tools menu in the user-interface or run the
program from the command. In order to include the secondary addresses in the
exported text output (.CSV file), make sure that the export file (CSV file) that
is specified when you export the directory contains the
Secondary-Proxy-Addresses in the header.

Complete the following steps to export the multiple addresses:

1. From the Admin program user-interface, click Directory Export on the Tools
  menu.

2. Select the Export File button to specify the text output file.

3. Select the Export button to export the directory.

4. If the export file specified in step #2 did not exist or did not contain the
  Secondary-Proxy-Addresses as part of the header, only the primary addresses
  would have shown in the exported text output.

5. Open the exported text output with any text editor.

6. Go to the end of the first line and add the following:

  , Secondary-Proxy-Addresses

7. Save and close the file.

8. Export the directory again. Make sure to specify the edited file as the
  export file. As a result, the exported text output has all e-mail
  addresses---the primary and the secondary addresses.
