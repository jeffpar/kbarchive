-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server versions 3.51, 4.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When a NetWare client uses Microsoft Chgpass.exe to change or synchronize
passwords on File and Print Services for NetWare (FPNW) and NetWare servers, the
message "Error getting PDC name" is returned.

CAUSE
=====

When the client gets a positive response for the object queries for the FPNWPDC
or SYNCPDC properties, it tries to contact the PDC in the following response
frame(s):

- client -&gt; server NCP Request: Read Property Value, Object Name = MS_WINNT,
  Property Name = SYNCPDC

- server -&gt; client: the server only returns the PDC name (for example
  EVEREST) NCP Reply: Read Property Value - Success

- client -&gt; server NCP Request: Read Property Value, Object Name = EVEREST,
  Property Name = NET_ADDRESS

- server-client: NCP Reply: Read Property Value - No such object

Because the client couldn't get the MAC address of the DSMN PDC, Chgpass.exe
returns the message "Error getting PDC name."

WORKAROUND
==========

The incorrect name of the DSMN PDC was returned by the NetWare server. If the
NetWare server returns incorrect information, delete the WINNT_SYNC_AGENT user
account from the NetWare server and add this NetWare server to your DSMN domain
(using DSMN Synchronization Manager). This way the correct information will be
written to the NetWare bindery.

For more information on adding a NetWare server to your DSMN domain, see Chapter
2 ("Adding a NetWare Server to Be Managed in a Domain") in the Administrator's
Guide for Directory Service Manager for NetWare.

Be aware that a NetWare server will continue to answer the client's CHGPASS
question regardless of whether it is a DSMN- added NetWare server (NCP Request:
Read Property Value, Object Name = MS_WINNT, Property Name = SYNCPDC). Also be
aware that if this NetWare server wasn't properly deleted using the DSMN
Synchronization Manager, it will return the original DSMN domain and PDC name.
If this happens, use the NetWare utility Setpass.exe to change the password on
the NetWare server, because this utility doesn't check for DSMN functionality.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If Microsoft Chgpass.exe is involved, the following will happen:

1. The client opens Chgpass.exe on an FPNW server and reads the .exe file:

  NCP Request: File Open PUBLIC\CHGPASS.EXE
  NCP Request: File Read
  NCP Request: Burst Read: 22,840 bytes

There are two situations in which the behavior of Chgpass.exe is different from
that of NetWare Setpass.exe: with an FPNW server and with a NetWare server
managed by Directory Service Manager for NetWare (DSMN).

2. The client checks to see if the servers it is attached to are real NetWare
  servers or FPNW servers. An FPNW server will return the domain and primary
  domain controller (PDC) name.

  NCP Request: Read Property Value, Object Name = MS_EXTENDED_NCPS, Property
  Name = FPNWPDC

  An FPNW server will respond with the PDC and domain name of the account
  domain.

3. The client asks the FPNW server for the MAC address of the PDC, and the
  server returns the address.

  NCP Request: Read Property Value, Object Name = Name_of_PDC, Property Name =
  NET_ADDRESS

4. The client connects via remote procedure call (RPC) over SPX to the PDC and
  changes the password. Before this happens, you will see in the trace that the
  client reads an RPC module:

  Request: File Open PUBLIC\RPC16C6.RPC

5. If the response to the request in item 2 is negative, the client checks to
  see if the server it is attached to is a NetWare server that is part of a
  DSMN domain:

  NCP Request: Read Property Value, Object Name = MS_WINNT, Property Name =
  SYNCPDC

  The PDC name returned is from the domain that added this NetWare server to the
  DSMN Synchronization Manager. The WINNT_SYNC_AGENT NetWare user account that
  is created when DSMN Synchronization Manager is installed on Windows NT is an
  indication that the NetWare server is managed by DSMN and that it will
  respond to this request.

  If the NetWare server is neither an FPNW server nor a DSMN- added server, it
  will answer both Read Property Value requests with "no such object," causing
  the NetWare client to change the password directly on this NetWare server as
  Setpass.exe from Novell would do.

6. The client asks the NetWare server for the MAC address of the PDC and the
  server returns the address.

  NCP Request: Read Property Value, Object Name = Name_of_PDC, Property Name =
  NET_ADDRESS

7. The password of the user is changed on the PDC of the DSMN domain the same
  way as with the FPNW server. The PDC will replicate the change to its backup
  domain controllers (BDCs) and the NetWare servers listed in the DSMN
  administrator tool.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Windows NT versions 3.51 and
4.0. We are researching this problem and will post new information here in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
