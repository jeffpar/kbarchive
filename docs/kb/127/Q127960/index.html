-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, version 3.2 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use the Microsoft Mail System Selector, included with version 3.2 of
Microsoft Mail Remote for Windows, you may receive the following error:

  Mail driver could not be activated because &lt;path&gt;\&lt;file&gt; could
  not be found

where &lt;path&gt; is the location of your Windows directory and &lt;file&gt;
could be one of the following files:

  MSRMTUI.DLL
  MSSFS.DLL

MSRMTUI.DLL is usually the file displayed in the error message when you change
from the Microsoft Mail for PC Networks driver to the Windows Remote driver.

MSSFS.DLL is usually the file displayed when you change from the Mail Remote
driver to the PC Networks driver.

CAUSE
=====

This problem is caused when you start Windows from either a batch file, NetWare
login script, or the command prompt with the command line such as,

  C:\WINDOWS\WIN

where C:\WINDOWS is the path to your Windows directory.

RESOLUTION
==========

NOTE: If you exit and restart Windows, the System Selector may function
properly.

Start Windows with one of the following methods:

1. Verify the Windows directory is on the PATH= statement in the AUTOEXEC.BAT
  file, and start Windows from the root directory.

2. Change to the Windows directory before you launch Windows.

For example,

If Windows (WIN.COM) is started from a NetWare login script or batch file such
as,

  f:login
  c:\windows\win

then change the entries similar to the following:

  f:login
  c:
  win

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in version 3.2 of Microsoft Mail
Remote for Windows. We are researching this problem and will post new
information here in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The file in the error message is usually the first file listed on the Files=
line of the [Transport] section of the FILES.INI file.

If you are using the System Selector to change from the PC Networks driver to
Remote driver, the specific FILES.INI used is the \&lt;Windows Path&gt;
\MSMAIL\MSRMT directory. If you copy the file from the error message to your
Windows directory without re-starting Windows, you will receive a similar error
message when you use the System Selector again. However, the specific file
listed will be the next file on the Files= line.

When you change from the Remote driver to the PC Networks driver, the specific
FILEL.INI used is from the \&lt;Windows Path&gt;\MSMAIL\MSMAIL subdirectory.
