current print line for comparison with the number of lines wanted.

FoxPro Tip, page 44. Using ON SHUTDOWN for Automatic Time Out. By Drew Speedie.
The ON SHUTDOWN procedure can provide a global yet graceful way to terminate an
application. This is essentially the same as using TIMEOUT in the application,
except that you shut down programmatically when you determine that termination
of a READ / BROWSE resulted from executing a TIMEOUT clause.
