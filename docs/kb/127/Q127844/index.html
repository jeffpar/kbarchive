SYMPTOMS
========

Calling the Destroy() function under program control to release an object does
not work. The object is still there and its methods can perform tasks. This
behavior is particularly visible with a form that receives the Destroy() because
the form window is not deactivated.

CAUSE
=====

When Destroy() is explicitly called under program control, the method associated
with the event is executed. However, calling the method does not trigger the
event. To release a form, you must release the instance variable referencing the
form object. The variable is released when it goes out of scope or when the
RELEASE command is issued.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.

MORE INFORMATION
================

In the Visual FoxPro event model, calling a method associated with an event will
not trigger the event. The method can be executed as a response to an event or
as a response to an explicit call (such as Thisform.Click()). To trigger the
CLICK, DBLCLICK, MOUSEDOWN, MOUSEMOVE, or MOUSEUP events, use the MOUSE command.
The ERROR event can be triggered by the ERROR command. For a list of events that
Microsoft Visual FoxPro objects respond to, search for Events under the Language
Reference topic in Visual FoxPro Help.
