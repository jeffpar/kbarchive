Last Modified: 14-MAR-1999

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Mail for PC Networks, versions 3.2, 3.2a 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

With version 3.2.11, 3.2.12, 3.2.13, and 3.2.14 of External.exe, if mail is
received at a postoffice with an unknown address, the following error message is
displayed:

  [002] Mail was received that was addressed to unknown addresses.

The unknown addresses of the original mail message will not be added to the
report in the System.log. Versions earlier than 3.2.11 of External.exe would
include the invalid addresses as part of the report.

Also, the non-delivery report mailed back to the sender would not include the
invalid addresses. In version earlier than 3.2.11, the addresses were included.

CAUSE
=====

Revisions to the External program in version 3.2.11 resulted in this behavior.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in versions 3.2.11, 3.2.12, 3.2.13,
and 3.2.14 of External.exe. This problem was corrected in External.exe version
3.2.15 (or later).

For version 3.2.15 (or later) of the MS-DOS version of External.exe, you can find
Extupd.exe, a self-extracting file, on the following services:

- Microsoft's World Wide Web Site on the Internet On the www.microsoft.com home
  page, click the Support icon. Click Knowledge Base, and select the product.
  Enter kbfile EXTUPD.EXE, and click GO! Open the article, and click the button
  to download the file.

- Internet (anonymous FTP) ftp ftp.microsoft.com Change to the Softlib/Mslfiles
  folder. Get EXTUPD.EXE

- The Microsoft Network On the Edit menu, click Go To, and then click Other
  Location. Type "mssupport" (without the quotation marks). Double-click the MS
  Software Library icon. Find the appropriate product area. Locate and Download
  EXTUPD.EXE.


For additional information about downloading, please see the following article in
the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
