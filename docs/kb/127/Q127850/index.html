-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.5 
- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.5 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

Windows NT Setup may not recognize your hard disks or your may stop responding
(hang) when booting if you use a DPT SmartRAID PCI (PM3224a/9x) SCSI controller
on an AST Manhattan P Series 5090 (single processor) computer.

CAUSE
=====

The DPT SmartRAID PCI (PM3224a/9x) SCSI controller is not on the Windows NT
version 3.5 hardware compatibility list (HCL), and it is not a supported device.

WORKAROUND
==========

Since the AST Manhattan P5090 is on the Windows NT 3.5 HCL, you may be able to
use the PM3224a controller if you configure it specifically for the P5090.
According to DPT technical support, you may need to perform some or all of the
following configuration steps for the system to successfully run Windows NT
3.5:

1. The DPT SmartRAID controller must be set as the boot device. If you set a
  disk connected to another controller as the boot device, then the system may
  hang at boot time.

2. Some models of the AST Manhattan P5090 have dual internal (embedded) NCR
  53C810 SCSI controllers. One of them must be disabled for the DPT PM3224a to
  work.

3. You need to explicitly specify an Input/Output (I/O) address in the BIOS
  configuration program for the DPT PM3224a host adapter. However, you do not
  need to choose the default setting of 330H as the I/O address for the card.
  To set the I/O address for the card, press CTRL-D at boot time, and then
  choose HBIO from the menu.

4. In certain cases you may also need to disable PCI Parity in the DPT BIOS for
  the initial installation to succeed. Otherwise, memory parity problems may
  result.

5. Once the machine boots successfully, replace the DPT driver supplied on the
  Windows NT distribution disks with an updated driver from DPT. This updated
  driver is available from the DPT bulletin board system (BBS) at (407)
  831-6432 (14000 to 2400 baud, HST/DUAL). The file name is NT351JJ.ZIP. Other
  DPT Bulletin Board numbers include: (407) 830-1070 (14400 to 1200 buad,
  HST/DUAL), and (407) 830-0852 (9600-1200 baud).

6. As of 2/1/97, the latest firmware for the DPT SmartRaid PCI (PM3224a/9x)
  controller is FW290-007H1. The latest ROM revision is SmartRom 3.DS.

above, please contact DPT directly at (407) 830-5522. You may also email DPT
