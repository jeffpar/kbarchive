-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you install Windows 95 on a computer with an uninterruptible power supply
(UPS) attached to a serial port, the UPS switches to battery mode during the
hardware detection portion of Setup. If Setup does not finish before the battery
in the UPS runs out, the UPS shuts down and the computer restarts.

CAUSE
=====

The hardware detection portion of Setup attempts to detect the computer's serial
ports. The method that Setup uses to query the serial ports can cause some
serial-port-monitoring UPS models to believe that the external power has failed.

RESOLUTION
==========

Disconnect the UPS monitoring cable from the serial port before you run Windows
95 Setup.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The following UPS models are known to exhibit the behavior described above:

- American Power Conversion Smart-UPS series (all models)

- American Power Conversion Matrix series (all models)
