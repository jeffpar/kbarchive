-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following information describes differences and similarities in path
constructs between the Macintosh and MS-DOS platforms and explains how to use
path constructs in FoxPro.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The rules for naming drives differ on the Macintosh and MS-DOS platforms. The
drive name on the MS-DOS platform consists of a single character followed by a
colon such as C: or D:. On the Macintosh, a drive name may look like Mac HD: or
Barney. The Macintosh drive name can even contain a space between multiple
letters whereas the MS-DOS style is limited to one character. Both, however, end
with a colon.

NOTE: Volume names, paths, and file names are not case sensitive. The term
"volume" is interchangable with "drive" on the Macintosh platform.

File Names
----------

Valid characters in file names are:

  A-Z, underscore, and 0-9 but do not begin a file name with a numeral.

Invalid characters according to the Finder are:

  Colon (:) - ASCII value 58
  Some systems substitute a dash -

Invalid characters according to FoxPro's Fcreate command are:

  Double Quotation mark (") - ASCII value 34
  Colon (:) - ASCII value 58
  Backslash (\) - ASCII value 92

Valid but potentially problematic characters are:

  Single Quotation mark (') - ASCII value 39
  Period (.) other than the one automatically appended - ASCII value 46
  Space ( ) - ASCII value 32

Path Strings
------------

A path is a series of directory names or folders separated by a delimiter
character such as a colon (:), which is the Macintosh notation, or a backslash
(\), which is the the MS-DOS notation. The path may or may not have a file name
at the end or a drive name at the beginning.

NOTE: Most FoxPro for Macintosh commands accept the path in either MS-DOS
backslash (\) format or Macintosh colon (:) format regardless of environment
settings. However, commands and functions such as FxNewFolder() from Foxtools,
which interact directly with the System, require a path in Macintosh shorthand
notation. Please see SYS(2027) in FoxPro Help for more information.

When to Use Quotation Marks
---------------------------

Surround the path and file name with quotation marks when any element of the
volume, path, or file name contains any spaces or characters other than those
suggested above. Surrounding a path with quotation marks may or may not be
necessary, but if they are extraneous, they will be ignored.

Path Examples
-------------

For the following examples, assume the following structure:

  Barney             &lt;-- A volume with same name as folder
     +-Fred1.dbf
     |
     +-Folder
        +-Fred2.dbf
        |
        +-SubFolder1
        |  +-Fred3.dbf
        |  |
        |  +-Barney  &lt;-- A folder with same name as volume
        |     +-Fred5.dbf
        |
        +-SubFolder2
           +-Fred4.dbf

Fully qualified paths to open the file FRED5.DBF:

  USE Barney:Folder:SubFolder1:Barney:Fred5
  USE Barney:\Folder\SubFolder1\Barney\Fred5

  * incorrect USE Barney\Folder\SubFolder1\Barney\Fred5

From root of the default volume to FRED3.DBF:

  USE \Folder\SubFolder1\Fred3
  USE \:Folder:SubFolder1:Fred3

NOTE: The critical difference between a relative path and a fully qualified path
to FRED5.DBF is the colon after but not before the volume name.

More Information on Relative Path Rules
---------------------------------------

Given that the default folder is SubFolder1 specified by this command:

     Default=Barney:Folder:SubFolder1

Two valid commands for opening the table in FoxPro are:

     USE Fred3

  This assumes MS-DOS shorthand that does not require a preceding path
  separator for references relative to the current directory.

     USE :Fred3

  This Macintosh shorthand does require a preceding path separator for
  references relative to the current directory.

Valid references to the child folder of current folder to FRED5.DBF are:

     USE :Barney:Fred5&lt;BR/&gt;
     USE Barney\Fred5

Valid references to the parent folder and FRED2.DBF are:

     USE ..\Fred2&lt;BR/&gt;
     USE ::Fred2

Valid references to the grandparent folder and FRED1.DBF are:

     USE ..\..\Fred1&lt;BR/&gt;
     USE :::Fred1

Valid references to the sibling folder and FRED4.DBF are:

     USE ..\SubFolder2\Fred4&lt;BR/&gt;
     USE ::SubFolder2:Fred4
