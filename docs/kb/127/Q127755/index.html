The information in this article applies to:

SYMPTOMS
========

After you start one of the applications listed at the top of this article, the
application's music will not play if the application is minimized.

RESOLUTION
==========

Use the following steps to play music from the above applications using the
Windows Media Player:

1. In the Accessories program group in Program Manager, double-click the Media
  Player icon.

2. From the Device menu, choose CD Audio.

3. Choose Scale and select Track. Move the scroll bar indicator to the number 2
  position.

  NOTE: Track 1 is data. No audio will play while on Track 1.

4. Choose the Play button. The Play button is a triangle pointing to the right
  with a vertical line on the left side. The Play button is located in
  lower-left corner of the Media Player dialog box.

5. Minimize Media Player by clicking the Minimize button located in the
  upper-right corner of the Media Player dialog box, or click the Control menu
  (-) located in the upper-left corner and choose Minimize.

6. The audio portion of the application listed at the top of this article will
  now continue to play with Media Player minimized.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The loss of audio is due to a limitation of the Visual Basic MCI CD Audio
functionality. Visual Basic was used in the creation of MCI CD Audio
functionality.

Multimedia Beethoven will continue to play when minimized because it is using
Asymetrix ToolBook for MCI CD Audio playback.
