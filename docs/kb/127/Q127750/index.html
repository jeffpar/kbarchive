SYMPTOMS
========

When you click Mona Weasel, all or part of the sticker rolls may be missing.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the file that contains the sticker rolls is missing
or damaged.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, delete the sticker roll file and reinstall the program to
restore the default sticker rolls.

NOTE: The following resolutions describe steps to resolve this issue in the
Windows and Macintosh operating environments. Use the appropriate steps for your
computer or operating system.

Microsoft Windows 95/98
-----------------------

To restore the default stickers in Windows 95/98, follow these steps:

1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.

2. In the Named box, type "w-mag100.chk" (without the quotation marks), and then
  click Find Now.

3. In the list of found files, right-click the W-mag100.chk file, and then click
  Delete.

4. Close the Find: Files Named W-mag100.chk window.

5. Reinstall Creative Writer or Fine Artist.

After you complete these steps, the default stickers should be available.

NOTE: Any personal stickers that you created cannot be retrieved using this
method and may be lost.

Microsoft Windows 3.x
---------------------

To restore the default stickers in Windows 3.x, follow these steps:

1. In Program Manager, double-click the Main program group.

2. In the Main group, double-click the File Manager icon.

3. Click the drive containing the MSKIDS directory (usually drive C).

4. In the MSKIDS directory, click the SHARED subdirectory. Then, click the STUFF
  subdirectory.

5. Click the W-mag100.chk file.

6. On the File menu, click Delete.

7. Reinstall Creative Writer or Fine Artist.

After you complete these steps, the default stickers should be available.

NOTE: Any personal stickers that you created cannot be retrieved using this
method and may be lost.

Macintosh
---------

To restore the default stickers on a Macintosh computer, follow these steps:

1. Open the hard disk drive, and then open the Microsoft Kids folder.

2. Drag the program folder and the program icon into the Trash. Do NOT throw
  away the Users folder.

3. Close the Microsoft Kids folder.

4. Open the System Folder on the hard disk drive, and then open the Preferences
  folder.

5. Drag the MSKids Preferences folder to the Trash.

6. Empty the Trash.

7. Reinstall Creative Writer or Fine Artist.

After you complete these steps, the default stickers should be available. Because
you did not delete the Users folder, any personal stickers that you created
should still be available.
