SUMMARY
=======

This articles describes how to control the order in which objects are selected
on a form.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When a form is displayed, the first object added to the form is by default the
first one accessed. When users tab through the form, the highlight moves by
default according to the order that the objects were added. It is possible to
control navigation in a form through the use of the TABINDEX property or the
SETFOCUS method.

Using the TABINDEX Property
---------------------------

This property specifies the Tab order of form objects in a Form. For example, say
you have a form with two command buttons (CmdButton1 and CmdButton2). You can
use the TabIndex property if you want to access CmdButton2 before CmdButton1 as
users press the TAB key. To achieve this, in the Form Designer, select the
TabIndex property in the Property Sheet and modify its value. You can also
modify the value of the TabIndex property under program control. For example:

     frmtest.CmdButton1.tabindex=2

The TabIndex property will be ignored if the TabStop property is set to .F. for
that control.


Using the SETFOCUS Method
-------------------------

The SetFocus method assigns the focus to a control. Use this method to move the
focus from one control in the form to another conditionally. For example, if
there are three command buttons on a form and you want to shift the focus from
CmdButton1 to CmdButton3 when the user clicks the CmdButton1 button, include the
following code in the Click event handler:

     Thisform.CmdButton3.SetFocus

Focus is set to CmdButton3 as the SetFocus method is invoked.

For more information about the TabIndex property and the SetFocus method, search
for TabIndex and SetFocus using the FoxPro Help system.
