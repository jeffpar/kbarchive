-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Visual FoxPro for Windows, version 3.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If TIME() is supplied as the initial value of a text box, The SET HOURS TO
command has no effect on the time value displayed.

CAUSE
=====

TIME() returns a character string in the 24-hour HH:MM:SS format regardless of
the SET HOURS setting. As a result, the text box control is not a time value but
a character value and will behave as such.

WORKAROUND
==========

Add a new method to the form to perform the necessary conversion regardless of
whether the SET HOURS TO value is determined by the current environment settings
or changed programmatically at run-time.

Step-by-Step Example
--------------------

Steps 1 through 5 in the following procedure illustrate how to change the hours
setting in a program by adding two option buttons. You can omit steps 2 through
5 if desired.

1. Open the desired form or create a new one named Form1.

2. Choose the Form Control toolbar from the View menu.

3. Pick the Option Group tool, and put a set of Option Buttons on the form.
  Change the Caption Property for each to read '12 Hour' and '24 Hour'
  respectively.

4. Double-click the Option Buttons to open the OptionsGroup1 code dialog.

5. Select Option1 under the Object list box. Then select Click from the
  procedure list box, and enter this code:

     SET HOURS TO 12
     THISFORM.TEXT1.VALUE = THISFORM.CivTym()

  While in the same code dialog, select Option2 from the Object combo box, and
  enter this code:

     SET HOURS TO 24
     THISFORM.TEXT1.VALUE = TIME()

6. If a new form was created in step 1, add a Text box (Text1) to the form, and
  remove any previous value of the Text1 text box from the Properties sheet.

7. While Form Designer is selected, choose the Form menu pad from the system
  menu, and select New Method. Enter CivTym as the Method Name.

8. In the Description box, enter the following and click OK to save the new
  method descriptor:

     Returns civilian time (hh:mm:ss ampm)

9. Choose Properties under the system menu View pad or click Form1 with the
  alternate mouse key to bring up the Options menu and choose Properties.

10. While Form1 is shown as the current object, choose the Method tab.

11. Double-click the civtym procedure at the end of the Method list, and enter
  this code:

      cTym = TIME()     &amp;&amp; Save the current time string
      iHr  = VAL(LEFT(cTym,2))   &amp;&amp; extract the numerical hour
      lPm  = iHr &gt; 12   &amp;&amp; logically, is it post meridian (after noon)?
      RETURN STR( IIF( lPm, iHr - 12, iHr ), 2 ) + SUBSTR( cTym, 3 ) + ;
              " " + IIF( lPm, 'p', 'a' )+".m."

12. From the same dialog, select the Init procedure, and enter this code:

      IF SET('HOURS') &gt; 12
         THISFORM.TEXT1.VALUE = TIME()
         ** optional setting code: remove if option buttons omitted
         *
         THISFORM.OPTIONGROUP1.OPTION1.VALUE = 0
         THISFORM.OPTIONGROUP1.OPTION2.VALUE = 1
         *
         ** end of optional setting code
      ELSE
         THISFORM.TEXT1.VALUE = THISFORM.CivTym()
         ** optional setting code: remove if option buttons omitted
         *
         THISFORM.OPTIONGROUP1.OPTION1.VALUE = 1
         THISFORM.OPTIONGROUP1.OPTION2.VALUE = 0
         *
         ** end of optional setting code
      ENDIF

13. Type SET HOURS TO 12 in the Command window.

14. Run the form, and note the display. If option buttons are used, note which
  is selected; then change it to 24 hours. Close the form. Then re-run it with
  the opposite hours setting in effect, and note the display.

STATUS
======

This behavior is by design.
