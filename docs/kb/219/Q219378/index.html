SUMMARY
=======

Microsoft Web Based Enterprise Management (WBEM) is not included with the
Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 5 (SP5) CD. WBEM will be updated and shipped
with future WinPack or service pack releases after SP5.

WBEM 1.1 is present in Windows NT Server 4.0 Service Pack 4 (CD only), and can be
installed through Wbemcore.exe in the appropriate I386 or Alpha folder.

Installing SP5 will not affect WBEM. The WBEM version will remain at 1.1, and
WBEM files will not be overwritten. WBEM version 1.1 can still be installed from
the Service Pack 4 CD after SP5 is installed.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Additional information will be posted on www.microsoft.com as it becomes
available.

WBEM is an industry standard used to allow Internet Web browser-based
administration of networked computers. WBEM version 1.1 is included with the
Windows NT Service Pack 4 CD and is located in the WBEM folder. The WBEM
architecture is built into Windows 98 and will be built into Windows 2000
Professional and Server to lower the Total Cost of Ownership. WBEM enables
information to be extracted from client computers regarding hardware
configuration such as the amount of RAM, processor, Hard disk capacity, and so
forth. This information is important for decision making and remote management
by other products such as Systems Management Server.

Information about the Service Pack 4 release of the WBEM version 1.1 protocol set
may be found at:

  http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/nts/downloads/recommended/NT4SvcPk4/NT4SvcPk4.asp

The following is a quote from the Web site:

  "Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) provides a bi-directional
  instrumentation access mechanism. It brings together the management data from
  the hardware platform, drivers and applications and passes the consolidated
  data into a consistent management information store. This store, developed to
  conform to the requirements of the Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM)
  proposals, uses the Desktop Management Task Force (DMTF) and Common
  Information Model (CIM) as the basis for exposing and interacting with this
  information. CIM and WMI are enabling technologies. Together these core
  technologies provide a powerful and consistent mechanism enabling management
  applications, platforms and consoles to perform a wide variety of management
  tasks on Windows-based hardware and software. (Available on CD-ROM only)"
