-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Windows NT client, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


SYMPTOMS
========

The Exchange Server 5.0 Client advanced security setting is not consistent when
you reply to an encrypted and digitally signed message.

When you reply to messages that have been encrypted and digitally signed, the
security setting on the reply message is different, depending on whether the
original message is open in a separate window or highlighted in the Inbox. When
a user receives encrypted and digitally signed messages and if the user has
encryption and digital signature on by default, regardless of the whether the
message is replied to/forwarded from a message window or from the Inbox, all
replies or forwards should be encrypted and signed. However, when the user opens
the message and clicks the Reply button, the resulting message is signed but not
encrypted.

CAUSE
=====

The Exchange Windows NT Client does not preserve the security settings when you
forward a message from an open item.

==========
