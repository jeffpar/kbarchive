IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

After you add or modify one of the values in the
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services registry key on your
computer running Windows NT 4.0, you may receive random or intermittent Dr.
Watson error messages with the Services.exe file as the source.

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs because the DependOnService value type for one or more
Windows NT services may be corrupt or incorrect. The registry may have become
corrupt, or a service's value may have been improperly configured.

RESOLUTION
==========

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.

To resolve this problem, verify that the value type for the DependOnService value
is set to REG_MULTI_SZ for all services that contain value entries. To do this,
perform one of the following:

- Use Registry Editor to examine each DependOnService value for the correct
  value type. To do this:

  1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

  2. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services

  3. Click each service to display to attendant DependOnService value for that
     key. If the value type is not listed as REG_MULTI_SZ, go to the How To
     Correct This Issue section.

- Export the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services key to an
  external file, and then use a standard text editor to check the individual
  DependOnService values for the correct value type:

  1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

  2. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services

  3. On the Registry menu, click Save Subtree As, type a unique name for the
     file, and then click Save.

  4. Quit Registry Editor.

  5. Use a standard text editor, such as Notepad, to review the file and
     confirm that the DependOnService value is associated with the correct
     value type. For each entry that is not listed as REG_MULTI_SZ, go to the
     How To Correct This Issue section.

- Use the Windows NT Diagnostics tool to identify incorrect value types for the
  DependOnService value.

  1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Administrative Tools (Common),
     and then click Windows NT Diagnostics.

  2. Click the Services tab, highlight each individual service, click
     Properties, and then click Dependencies.

  3. If you are experiencing this exact issue, the Service Dependency window
     may contain values that look like this:

  MSExchangeIS
  end||
  ee|e|e
  e|||

NOTE:The Above characters "e" and "|" were substituted for the illegible symbols
that may be displayed.

  4. Make a note of the service that contains these invalid entries and then
     proceed to the How To Correct This Issue section.

How To Correct This Issue:
--------------------------

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services

3. Highlight the DependOnService value, make a note of the current value
  entries, and then press DELETE.

4. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry
  value:

  Value Name: DependOnService
  Data Type:  REG_MULTI_SZ
  Value:      &lt;dependent on each unique service&gt;

5. Quit Registry Editor, and then restart the computer.

MORE INFORMATION
================

The Dr. Watson log, located in the %SystemRoot% folder, may also show a call
similar to the following in the stack trace below the faulted function:

  services!ScReadDependencies

Windows NT reads the service dependencies for the service attempting to start,
identifies any incorrect value types, and then generates a Dr. Wastson error
message.

For additional information about the DependOnService value, please see the
following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
