SUMMARY
=======

This article provides a sample script that can be used to back up the Internet
Information Services (IIS) metabase as a scheduled task by using Windows Script
Host (WSH).

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: ANY USE BY YOU OF THE CODE PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE IS AT YOUR OWN
RISK. Microsoft provides this code "as is" without warranty of any kind, either
express or implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of
merchantability and/or fitness for a particular purpose.

IIS supports programmatic administration of the metabase using the Active
Directory Servies Interface (ADSI). The sample script that is listed below
creates a backup of the metabase that will be stored in the following path:

  %SystemRoot%\System32\InetSrv\MetaBack

NOTE: This folder is a fixed location and cannot be changed.

To create the sample WSH script and a scheduled task to run the script, follow
these steps:

1. Save the following code in your C:\Inetpub\Adminscripts folder as
  Mbackup.vbs:

  '****************************************
  ' Description:
  '   Metabase Backup Utility   
  ' Syntax:
  '   CSCRIPT MBACKUP.VBS
  '****************************************

  Option Explicit
  On Error Resume Next

  ' Declare variables.
  Dim strBackupName, lngBackupVersion, lngBackupFlags
  Dim objComputer
  Dim strDay, strMonth, strYear

  ' Get the current DD/MM/YY as strings.
  strDay   = Right("00" &amp; Cstr(Day(Date())),2)
  strMonth = Right("00" &amp; Cstr(Month(Date())),2)
  strYear  = Cstr(Year(Date()))

  ' Create a file name from the current date.
  strBackupName = strYear &amp; "-" &amp; strMonth &amp; "-" &amp; strDay

  ' Use the next available version number.
  lngBackupVersion = &amp;HFFFFFFFF
  lngBackupFlags = 0
   
  ' Output the backup message.
  Wscript.Echo "Backing up metabase to file: """ &amp; strBackupName &amp; """"

  ' Get the ADSI object.
  Set objComputer = GetObject("IIS://LOCALHOST")

  ' Call the backup method.
  objComputer.Backup strBackupName, lngBackupVersion, lngBackupFlags

  ' Check for errors.  
  If Err.Number &lt;&gt; 0 Then
    Wscript.Echo "Error: "  &amp; Err.Description &amp; " (0x" &amp; Right(String(8,"0") &amp; Hex(Err.Number),8) &amp; ")"
  Else
    Wscript.Echo "Success."
  End If

NOTE: The following code can be appended to the previous sample to delete old
backups. To customize this, change the value of the lngBackupToDelete variable
in the script.

  '****************************************
  ' The remaining code is optional and deletes a specific older backup.
  '****************************************

  ' The value of lngBackupToDelete determines which specific date to delete
  ' in this case. 28 days is four weeks ago if you are running a weekly backup.
  Const lngBackupToDelete = 28 

  ' Declare variables.
  Dim strOldDay, strOldMonth, strOldYear, strOldBackupName

  ' Get the old DD/MM/YY as strings.
  strOldDay   = Right("00" &amp; Cstr(Day(Date()-lngBackupToDelete)),2)
  strOldMonth = Right("00" &amp; Cstr(Month(Date()-lngBackupToDelete)),2)
  strOldYear  = Cstr(Year(Date()-lngBackupToDelete))

  ' Create the file name from the old date.
  strOldBackupName = strOldYear &amp; "-" &amp; strOldMonth &amp; "-" &amp; strOldDay

  ' Output the deletion message.
  Wscript.Echo "Deleting metabase backup file: """ &amp; strOldBackupName &amp; """"

  ' Call the deletion method.
  objComputer.DeleteBackup strOldBackupName, 0

  ' Check for errors.  
  If Err.Number &lt;&gt; 0 Then
    If Err.Number = &amp;H80070002 Then
      Wscript.Echo "File not found."
    Else
      Wscript.Echo "Error: "  &amp; Err.Description &amp; " (0x" &amp; Right(String(8,"0") &amp; Hex(Err.Number),8) &amp; ")"
    End If
  Else
    Wscript.Echo "Success."
  End If

2. Create a task to schedule the backup script. At a command prompt, type a
  command similar to the following:

   - For a task that runs every Monday at 6:00am:

  AT 6:00am /every:M cscript.exe c:\inetpub\adminscripts\mbackup.vbs

   - For a task that runs once at 9:00pm:

  AT 9:00pm cscript.exe c:\inetpub\adminscripts\mbackup.vbs

   - For a task that runs on the first of every month at 1:00am:

  AT 1:00am /every:1 cscript.exe c:\inetpub\adminscripts\mbackup.vbs
