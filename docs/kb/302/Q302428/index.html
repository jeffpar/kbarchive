SYMPTOMS
========

If you install MSN Explorer 6.0 (build 911.2) in a directory other than the
default directory on a Windows 95 or 98 computer, or if you install Windows XP
on a computer that includes an updated version of MSN Explorer, then Windows XP
will automatically install this updated version of MSN Explorer in its default
location: C:\Program Files\MSN. The newer version of MSN Explorer will overwrite
all shortcuts pointing to the MSN Explorer 6.0 client, and will leave the 6.0
files intact.

It's possible to delete these unnecessary files by running the file msnunin.exe
from the Setup folder using the msnunin.exe file (this file is located in the
directory where MSN Explorer 6.0 was originally installed). However, msnunin.exe
can also remove important registry keys that may be necessary in executing the
updated version of MSN Explorer that was installed with Windows XP.

CAUSE
=====

This is a known issue.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you want to delete files left over from your installation of MSN Explorer
6.0, do not click the msnunin.exe file. Instead, delete the entire MSNCorefiles
folder for MSN Explorer 6.0. This folder is located in the directory you chose
when you first installed MSN Explorer.
Note: Do not delete the default MSNCorefiles folder installed by Windows XP. This
file is located at C:\Program Files\MSN.
