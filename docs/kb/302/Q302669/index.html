The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Exchange Server, versions 5.5, 5.5 SP1, 5.5 SP2, 5.5 SP3, 5.5 SP4 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


IMPORTANT: This article contains information about modifying the registry. Before you modify the registry, make sure to back it up and make sure that you understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. For information about how to back up, restore, and edit the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q256986 Description of the Microsoft Windows Registry

SYMPTOMS
========

After you use the ExMerge resource kit utility (or other unsupported means) to
move mailbox data between Exchange Server 5.5 sites, organizations, or between
recipients containers within the same site, when a user tries to use a client to
modify and resend an appointment with invitees, or to resend a message from the
sent items folder, the user may receive the following error message:

  You do not have the permission to send the message on behalf of the specified
  user.

CAUSE
=====

To resolve this problem, this fix adds a registry value that you can use to make
the information store look up X.500 proxy addresses even if the Move Server
Wizard was never run. Code is added to the information store to handle cases in
which ExMerge was used to move mailboxes between Exchange 5.5 sites or
organizations. To enable the new functionality, first edit the registry to add
the AlwaysLookupX500Proxy value using the procedure outlined below, then apply
the fix that is described in the "Resolution" section of this article to the
affected Exchange Server 5.5 SP4 computer."

ExMerge does not update the distinguished names of the message sender. When a
user whose mailbox has been moved attempts to resend one of the messages, the
information store does not perform lookups of X.500 proxy addresses by default.
This causes the permissions error message that is described in the "Symptoms"
section of this article. If you use the Move Server Wizard, the information
store can perform lookups of X.500 proxies.

ExMerge is a BackOffice Resource Kit utility, and therefore falls under the
BackOffice Resource Kit utilities support boundaries. For additional
information, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
Knowledge Base:

  Q303056 XADM: BackOffice Resource Kit Utility Support Boundaries

RESOLUTION
==========

A supported fix is now available from Microsoft, but it is only intended to
correct the problem described in this article and should be applied only to
systems experiencing this specific problem. This fix may receive additional
testing at a later time, to further ensure product quality. Therefore, if you
are not severely affected by this problem, Microsoft recommends that you wait
for the next Microsoft Exchange Server 5.5 service pack that contains this fix.

To resolve this problem immediately, contact Microsoft Product Support Services
to obtain the fix. For a complete list of Microsoft Product Support Services
phone numbers and information about support costs, please go to the following
address on the World Wide Web:

  http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=fh;EN-US;CNTACTMS

NOTE: In special cases, charges that are normally incurred for support calls may
be canceled, if a Microsoft Support Professional determines that a specific
update will resolve your problem. Normal support costs will apply to additional
support questions and issues that do not qualify for the specific update in
question.

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: Information store

+-------------------------+
| File name | Version     | 
+-------------------------+
| Store.exe | 5.5.2655.20 | 
+-------------------------+

NOTE: Because of file dependencies, this fix requires Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5 Service Pack 4.



STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Exchange Server
version 5.5.

MORE INFORMATION
================

WARNING: If you use Registry Editor incorrectly, you may cause serious problems
that may require you to reinstall your operating system. Microsoft cannot
guarantee that you can solve problems that result from using Registry Editor
incorrectly. Use Registry Editor at your own risk.
To resolve this problem, this fix adds a registry value that you can use to make
the information store look up X.500 proxy addresses even if the Move Server
Wizard was never run. Code is added to the information store to handle cases in
which ExMerge was used to move mailboxes between Exchange Server 5.5 sites or
organizations. To enable the new functionality, apply the fix that is described
in the "Resolution" section of this article to the affected Exchange Server 5.5
SP4 computer, and then edit the registry to add the AlwaysLookupX500Proxy
value.

To add the AlwaysLookupX500Proxy value:

1. Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).

2. Locate and click the following key in the registry:

  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\CurrentControlSet\Services\MSExchangeIS\ParametersSystem

3. On the Edit menu, click Add Value, and then add the following registry value:

  Value name: AlwaysLookupX500Proxy
  Data type: REG_DWORD
  Radix: Decimal
  Value data: 1

4. Quit Registry Editor.

You must stop and restart the Exchange Server Information Store service for the
change to take effect.

To turn off this functionality, change the preceding value data to 0, and then
restart the Exchange Server Information Store service.

You also need to add an X.500 proxy address that points back to the old
Obj-Dist-Name to each mailbox that has been moved. For example, if a mailbox in
the source site or organization had the following Obj-Dist-Name

  /o=Organization/ou=Site/cn=Recipients/cn=Mailbox

you need to create an X.500 proxy address for the mailbox in the destination
organization or site as follows:

  E-mail address: /o=Organization/ou=Site/cn=Recipients/cn=Mailbox
  E-mail type: X500
