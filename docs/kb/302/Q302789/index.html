SYMPTOMS
========

You sign in to MSN Explorer and click the E-mail icon in the top toolbar. You
click the Address Book tab, and then you sort the entries in the address book by
another criteria (for example, by e-mail address) by clicking on the heading for
a particular column. You sign out of MSN Explorer and sign back in. You start
the Address Book as described above. The entries in the Address Book are once
again sorted by nickname.

CAUSE
=====

This is a known issue.

RESOLUTION
==========

By default, MSN Explorer sorts the address book entries by the Nickname. If you
wish to view the entries sorted by another field, click the heading for that
particular column (clicking once will sort in ascending order and place an
upwards arrow by the field, and clicking again will sort in descending order and
place a downwards arrow by the field). You must do this procedure each time you
sign in.
