- The Microsoft Network version 6.1

SYMPTOMS
========

You install version 6.0 of DellNet by MSN software, and then upgrade to version
6.1 of the DellNet by MSN software after installation. You uninstall the DellNet
by MSN software by clicking Add/Remove Programs in the Control Panel. Next, you
attempt to install an earlier version of the MSN software on the computer
(version 5.2). You receive an error message stating that a newer version of the
software is already installed on the machine, and the installation is cancelled.
This occurs even though the DellNet by MSN software has been uninstalled.

CAUSE
=====

The registry key HKLM\Software\Microsoft\MSN\SoftwareInstalled remains on the
machine, falsely indicating that version 6.0 of the MSN software is installed on
the computer.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue, you must delete the registry key
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\MSN\SoftwareInstalled.
To delete HKLM\Software\Microsoft\MSN\SoftwareInstalled

1. Click Start, and then click Run.

2. Type regedit in the box, and then click OK.
  The registry editor box appears

3. Next to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, click +.

4. In the expanded list that appears, click + next to Software.

5. Click + next to Microsoft.

6. Click + to MSN.

7. Select SoftwareInstalled.

8. In the top menu of the registry editor, click File, and then click Delete.
  A warning dialog box that appears.
