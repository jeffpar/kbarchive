SYMPTOMS
========

You click Guest Sign In with MSN Explorer 6.1 with a non-paying (non MSN
Internet Access subscriber) msn.com or Hotmail.com e-mail account. You do this
on a computer that has no MSN Internet Access users set up in MSN Explorer. You
click Help And Settings in the upper-right corner, and then you click Switch to
MSN dial-up Internet Access. You follow the directions to upgrade the account to
a paying MSN Internet Access account. Even though you used Guest Sign In, a user
tile for the account is added to the computer, and your account becomes the
"account manager" account for this computer--because you are now an Internet
Access subscriber. When you add a new user to the computer, you must type the
password for the newly free-to-paid account. Also, signing in to this new
account allows you to delete any other accounts present on the computer.

CAUSE
=====

This is a known issue.

RESOLUTION
==========

If you do not want this account to remain on the computer, you can delete the
user tile. However, to delete the account manager, you must first delete any
other accounts that are on the computer. After deleting these "child" accounts,
and then removing the "account manager" account, you can add the child accounts
back to MSN Explorer.
Note: You may wish to write the user names and passwords the child accounts as
you delete these accounts, so you can easily add the accounts later.
To remove the accounts

1. Using the account manager account, start MSN Explorer 6.1 .

2. In the upper-right corner, click Help And Settings.

3. On the left menu, click Accounts, and then click Remove Users.
  You should now see a list of all users on the machine, and the Remove link
  beside the primary account will be disabled.

4. Do one of the following:
   - If there are child accounts on the machine, click on the Remove link
     beside one of the child accounts.

   - Otherwise, next the account that was just added, click the Remove link.
     A warning screen appears.

5. Click OK, and then click OK again.
  If the account you removed was a child account, you will now be taken back to
  the list of accounts, minus the one that was just removed.

6. Repeat steps 4-5 for each child account on the machine.
  After all child accounts have been removed, the Remove link beside the primary
  account will be active.

7. Click the Remove link.

8. Click OK, and then click OK again.
  You will now be taken to the Welcome screen of MSN Explorer.
