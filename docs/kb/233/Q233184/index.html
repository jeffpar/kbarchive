SYMPTOMS
========

If you print your daily calendar by using the daily style, meeting items that
are scheduled earlier than 7:00 A.M. or later than 7:00 P.M. do not print,
although they show up in the print preview.

CAUSE
=====

There is an all-day event scheduled on that day.

WORKAROUND
==========

To work around this problem, you can modify the daily style time range to
include the appointment times:

1. On the File menu, click Print, and then click Page Setup.

2. Under Options, in the Print From list, click the earliest time that you want
  to print for the daily calendar, and in the Print To list, click the latest
  time that you want to print for the daily calendar.

You can also create a new print style that includes a print range beyond the
default times of 7:00 A.M. to 7:00 P.M.:

1. On the File menu, click Print.

2. Click Daily Style, and then click Define Styles.

3. In the Define Print Styles dialog box, click the print style that you want to
  copy as a new print style, and then click Copy.

4. Under Options, in the Print From list, click the earliest time that you want
  to print for the daily calendar, and in the Print To list, click the latest
  time that you want to print for the daily calendar.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed that this is a problem in the Microsoft products that
are listed at the beginning of this article.

MORE INFORMATION
================

If you change the default print style, you affect the way that all of the folder
items for which you use that style print. In contrast, if you create a new print
style, you can maintain the default print style and still use the new print
style when applicable.

Because you create a new print style by copying an existing batch of settings,
you only need to modify the specific settings that you want to change; you do
not have to set all of the options yourself. Also, you do not have to re-create
your special print style for every view or folder, because in any instance in
which the print style you copied applies, your custom style is also displayed,
for example, in the Print dialog box or the Page Setup: &lt;style name&gt;
dialog box.
