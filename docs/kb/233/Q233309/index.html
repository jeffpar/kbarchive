- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 4.0 
- Microsoft Routing and Remote Access Service Update for Windows NT Server version 4.0

SYMPTOMS
========

When you use your Windows NT 4.0-based server to try to dial into a Remote
Access Service (RAS) or Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS) server that is
a primary domain controller (PDC), you may receive a "no domain controller
found" error message.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior occurs when the Windows NT 4.0 Server-based computer is running
and you choose "Log on using dial up networking", the connection is established
and the netlogon requests are sent over the dial-up networking (DUN) connection
with a source IPX network that corresponds to the Internal Network ID configured
on the server.

When the Windows NT 4.0 Server-based computer uses DUN, it sends its logon
requests with the Internal Network ID for the source IPX address. The RAS or
RRAS server has already pre-configured an IPX network for all DUN clients which
it will use to handle netlogon requests. When it receives a netlogon request
from the Windows NT 4.0 Server-based computer with a source IPX network number
that is unaware of, it ignores these netlogon queries.

Because of this, the Windows NT 4.0 client computer never receives a netlogon
reply, and you may not be logged on, or you may be logged on using cached
credentials from a previous successful logon.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this issue for a Windows NT 4.0 Server-based computer, you must
change the internal network ID (or number) back to all zeroes in IPX/SPX
Properties. Note that after you do so, when you are dialing into the RAS or RRAS
server, your Windows NT 4.0 Server-based computer will use the IPX network
number that it received from the RAS or RRAS server as the source for the
packet.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you install IPX on a Windows NT 4.0 Server-based computer, you receive a
message indicating you should not leave the Internal Network ID as all zeroes
for routing purposes. You do not receive this message when you install IPX on a
Windows NT 4.0 Workstation-based computer because it does not need an Internal
Network ID configured.

The reason that Windows NT 4.0 Server-based computers use the Internal Network ID
by default is that they are usually intended to be IPX routers. When an Windows
NT 4.0 Server-based computer is dialing another location, it interprets that it
is still acting as an IPX router. However, the RAS or RRAS server that it is
dialing does not support IPX routing over normal DUN connections. Because of
this, the RAS or RRAS server does not attempt to discover the Windows NT 4.0
Server-based computer Internal Network ID.

To route IPX packets from one network to another, you must install the Routing
and Remote Access Update on the Windows NT 4.0 Server-based computer and
configure it for IPX routing and demand dial interfaces. For additional
information about routing IPX packets from one network to another, click the

  Q175640 How To Configure Nwlink LAN-to-LAN Routing Using RRAS

NOTE: Only in the case where you are using your Windows NT 4.0 Server-based
computer as a DUN client and you want to log on to the domain will it be
necessary to change your internal network ID to all zeroes. Otherwise, you can
leave it configured as it is.
