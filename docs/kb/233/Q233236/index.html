SYMPTOMS
========

Messages sent from Microsoft Mail to Exchange Server through the MS Mail
Connector Interchange (MSMI) using a Chinese Outlook client are not delivered to
their destination. The sender receives a non-delivery report (NDR) similar to
the following:

  

  Your Message
 	  To:   &lt;somebody@microsoft.com&gt;
    Subject:   Test Message From Chinese Outlook/MSMail

  Was not delivered for the following reasons:

    Delivery failed to MS:MICROSOFT/SITE/SOMEBODY
    Reason: 0 (transfer failed)
    diagnostic: -1 (no diagnostic).
    MSEXCH:MSExchangeMTA:SITE:SERVER.

  Original message body follows...

The following events are logged in the event log:

  Event ID: 2025
  Source: MSExchangeIS Private
  Description:
  The delivery of a message failed due to error 80004005. A non-delivery report

  Event ID: 270
  Source: MSExchangeMTA
  Description:
  A permanent error has occurred with Entity
  /O=MICROSOFT/OU=SITE/CN=CONFIGURATION/CN=SERVERS/CN=SERVER/CN=MICROSOFT
  PRIVATE MDB. Entity is a Message. Object is a Normal Priority Message.

  Content length: 1235, External Trace information (first 100 bytes) =

  PDU dump reference 5 [MTA SUBMIT 17 74] (14)

  Event ID: 290
  Source: MSExchangeMTA
  Description:
  A non-delivery report (reason code transfer-failure and diagnostic code Omit
  any diagnostic code) is being generated for message C=US;A=
  ;P=Microsoft;L=MICROSOFT-SITE-00000287. It was originally destined for
  DN:/o=Microsoft/ou=SITE/cn=Recipients/cn=Somebody&lt;A7&gt; (recipient number 1), and
  was to be redirected to . [MTA DISP:RESULT 20 136] (12)

CAUSE
=====

This problem occurs when the Microsoft Exchange Server information store
receives the message from the message transfer agent (MTA) and detects that
there are two MAPI Properties for strings within the message that have
conflicting code page IDs. The information store sends an NDR for the message
because of the discrepancy.

This problem will not occur if the Chinese Exchange client is used instead of the
Chinese Outlook client because the Chinese Outlook client includes four
additional MAPI Properties for the TNEF portion of the message, one of which is
an additional string property containing a code page ID.

RESOLUTION
==========

To resolve this problem, obtain the latest service pack for Exchange Server
version 5.5. For additional information, please see the following article in the
Microsoft Knowledge Base:

  Q191014 XGEN: How to Obtain the Latest Exchange Server 5.5 Service Pack

The English version of this fix should have the following file attributes or
later:

Component: MSMI

| File name | Version | 
+---------------------+
| Mt.exe    | 2619.0  | 
+---------------------+
| Mtmsg.dll | 2619.0  | 
+---------------------+


STATUS
======

version 5.5 Service Packs 1, 2. This problem was first corrected in Exchange
Server 5.5 Service Pack 3.
