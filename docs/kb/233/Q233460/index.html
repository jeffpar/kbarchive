-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Business Planner 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

If you share a business plan created in Microsoft Business Planner over a
network, data that is entered into the Business Plan wizard may be unexpectedly
changed or lost.

CAUSE
=====

This behavior can occur if the following conditions are true:

- The folder containing the business plan is shared with full access rights to
  multiple users.

- A user with access to the shared folder saves changes to the business plan.

RESOLUTION
==========

To work around this issue, contact the owner of the business plan before you
enter data in the plan.

STATUS
======

Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Microsoft Business Planner.

MORE INFORMATION
================

When you are entering data in a shared business plan, you are not notified if
another user opens that plan. As a result, multiple users can overwrite business
plan data without being aware that they are doing so.

Additional query words: msbp sharing gone altered
