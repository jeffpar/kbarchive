SYMPTOMS
========

On your Windows NT-based computer, you may receive one of the following event
log messages in Event Viewer:

  Event ID: 4320
  Source: NetBT
  Type: Error
  Description: Another machine has sent a name release message to this machine
  probably because a duplicate name has been detected on the TCP network. The
  IP address of the node that sent the message is in the data. Use nbtstat -n
  in a command window to see which name is in the Conflict state.

  -or-

  Event ID: 4319
  Source: NetBT
  Type: Error
  Description: A duplicate name has been detected on the TCP network. The IP
  address of the machine that sent the message is in the data. Use nbtstat -n
  in a command window to check which name is in the conflict state.

CAUSE
=====

This message is caused when another computer sends a name release message to
your computer. The most likely reason for this is that a duplicate name has been
detected on the network.


MORE INFORMATION
================

Use the NBTSTAT -N command to see the name of the computer in the conflict
state. The IP address of the node that sent the message is in the data returned
by this command. The following example shows what the data may look like in one
of these events:

  0000:   00   00   04   00   01   00   54   00
  0008:   00   00   00   00   e0   10   00   c0
  0010:   00   00   00   00   00   00   00   00
  0018:   00   00   00   00   00   00   00   00
  0020:   00   00   00   00   00   00   00   00
  0028:   e7   1a   65   16

Offset 28 is the IP address of the computer requesting name release. To determine
the decimal IP address, invert the four hexadecimal numbers and convert them to
decimal numbers separated by periods. Using this method, the IP address of E7 1A
65 16 becomes 22.101.26.231.

The status column of the NBTSTAT output for the computer in conflict should
contain either "Conflict" or "Released."

You can run the NBTSTAT -A command with the IP address to get the computer name.

NOTE: This error message is generated in many cases due to normal circumstances,
and should not be cause for alarm.
