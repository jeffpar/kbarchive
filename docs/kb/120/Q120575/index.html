The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows NT Server version 3.1,3.5,3.51,4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Workstation version 3.1,3.5,3.51,4.0 
- Microsoft Windows NT Advanced Server 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When installing two IBM Token Ring network cards, the following event message
appears in Event Viewer:

  Event ID: 5012, Source: IbmTok01, Type: Error
  Description: The I/O base address supplied does not match jumpers on adapter.

CAUSE
=====

The IBM Token Ring network adapter driver, IBMTOK.SYS, is looking for specific
Primary and Secondary Base I/O addresses which must match the switches set on
the adapter (Switch 9).

RESOLUTION
==========

Configure the Base I/O ROM addresses and corresponding switches listed below on
the adapter for the following switch 9 positions:

  Switch 9           Base I/O Address   Base I/O Switches
  (Position)         (Size = 8K)
  -------------------------------------------------------
  Primary            CC00               1, 4, 5 - up
  (Switch 9 = up)                       2, 3, 6 - down
  Secondary          DC00               1, 3, 4, 5 - up
  (Switch 9 = down)                     2, 6 - down

NOTE: Although the adapter supports other base I/O addresses, the IBM Token Ring
driver supplied with Windows NT only supports the addresses of CC00 and DC00. If
either of these addresses conflict with other installed base I/O addresses,
reconfigure other adapters in order to accommodate the required I/O base
addresses of the IBM Token Ring driver. This adapter reserves two separate
address ranges - One for base I/O and one for Shared RAM. Make sure that these
two address ranges do not overlap by using the WinMSD utility.

MORE INFORMATION
================

Dip-switch settings for the IBM Token Ring adapter are:

  Switches 1-6     Base I/O ROM Address
  Switches 7,8     Interrupt Level (valid interrupts are 2, 3, 6, 7)
                   For IRQ 2 Jumper, these switches are down.
  Switches 9       Primary / Secondary adapter
  Switches 10,11   Shared RAM Size 8K , 16K, 32K, 64K
                   For 8K shared memory, 10 and 11 are down;
                   for 16K shared memory, 10 is up and 11 is down.
                   Shared RAM size addresses are reserved as follows:
                   - Primary adapter (Switch 9 = up) starts at D0000.
                   - Secondary adapter (Switch 9 = down) starts at E0000.
                   Listed below is a Length and Size equivalency chart:

                   Length        Size
                   ------------------
                   0x2000         8K
                   0x4000        16K
                   0x8000        32K
                   0x10000       64K

  Switches 12      4Mbs / 16Mbs network
                   For 4 MB, Jumper 12 is down.
