The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Windows 95 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SYMPTOMS
========

When you run the benchmark program Winstone 94, it reports the following error
during the WordPerfect tests:

  WPWINFIL

  An error has occurred in your program. To keep working anyway, click ignore
  and save your work in a new file. To quit this program, click Close. You will
  lose information you entered since your last save.

Clicking Close results in another error message:

  This program has performed an illegal operation and will be shut down. If the
  problem persists contact the program vendor.

Choosing to shut down causes the system to stop responding (hang). You must turn
off the computer and then restart it.

CAUSE
=====

During tests, these errors occur when Winstone replaces the Windows 95 Hppcl.drv
and Unidrv.dll files with older Windows 3.1 versions of these files.

RESOLUTION
==========

Copy the Hppcl.drv and Unidrv.dll files from the Windows 95 System folder to the
Winstone\Windows\System folder.

For information about how to copy a file, click Start, click Help, click the
Index tab, type "copying" (without the quotation marks), and then double-click
the "Copying files" topic.
