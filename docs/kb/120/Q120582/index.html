SYMPTOMS
========

The Directory Replicator service fails to start. Event Viewer logs error 1057 or
1069.

CAUSE
=====

These errors can result from incorrect configuration of the Directory Replicator
service, from incorrect configuration information in the Registry, or because
domain user account information has not been synchronized. The most likely
reason is that the password is invalid or the account was not granted "Logon as
a service" privileges. Verify that you have completed the following steps to set
up the service:

1. Create a domain user, for example "REPLUSER", with a proper password. Make it
  a member of Domain Users, Backup operators, Replicator groups.

  - Select Password never expires.
  - Clear User must change password at next logon.
  - Clear User cannot change password.
  - Clear Account disabled.
  - Allow all hours for logon.
  - Do not define a user profile or login script.

2. From User Manager for Domains, choose User Rights from the Policies menu.
  Select Show advanced user rights and grant the Replicator group the "Logon as
  a Service" right.

3. From Server Manager for Domains, select the server and choose Services from
  the Computer menu. A list of services running on the server appears. Select
  the Directory Replicator service and choose Startup.

4. Specify startup type to be automatic and mark the default logon as "This
  account," choosing REPLUSER. Type the correct password for the user in the
  Password and Confirm password fields.

  NOTE: The only password verification performed at this step is to check that
  the Password and Confirm Password fields are the same. It is possible to
  enter an incorrect user password in these fields; however, when the Directory
  Replicator service attempts to start it will fail.

Attempt to start the Directory Replicator service. If the error still occurs
after following the previous steps, there may be a problem with the Registry
information.

WARNING: Using Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious, system-wide
problems that may require you to reinstall Windows NT to correct them. Microsoft
cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Registry Editor can
be solved. Use this tool at your own risk.

Edit the ObjectName value under the following key in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
subtree:

  \System\Current Control Set\Service\Replicator

Make sure the data type of ObjectName is REG_SZ and the value is &lt;domain
name&gt;\repluser (where &lt;domain name&gt; is the correct domain for the
Repluser account.)

After editing the Registry, attempt to start the Directory Replicator service
again. If the error persists, there may be a problem with the User Account or
the User Account database. Check the System Event Log for errors generated by
the Netlogon service. Verify that the user account database is successfully
synchronized on all of the servers in the domain. Proceed with troubleshooting
domain synchronization problems if these errors are revealed.
