The information in this article applies to:

- Microsoft Flight Simulator for MS-DOS, version 5.0 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY
=======

The following is a definition of terms used in the generation of weather areas
in Flight Simulator version 5.0.

MORE INFORMATION
================

- Beginning Lat/Lon:

  This specifies the starting point of the weather area.

- Ending Lat/Lon:

  This specifies the ending point of the weather area.

  For example, if you want a weather front to move from Chicago to New York, you
  would specify the starting point as the Chicago area Lat/Lon, and the ending
  point as the New York area Lat/Lon. Beginning and ending Lat/Lon DO NOT
  determine the size of the front.

- Course:

  This is the direction that the front is facing as it moves from the beginning
  Lat/Lon to the Ending Lat/Lon. Course DOES NOT determine the direction of the
  winds within the area.

- Speed:

  This is the speed in Nautical miles of the front as it moves from the
  beginning Lat/Lon to the ending Lat/Lon.

- Transition:

  The transition value determines the overall depth of the front as well as how
  abruptly the aircraft will encounter the weather conditions within the area.

  For example, let's say the Global weather area is set for clear skies and no
  winds, and a weather area is established over Meigs Field in the Chicago
  area. In the Meigs weather area, strong winds and overcast clouds are
  configured. If the Transition value is small, the aircraft will abruptly run
  into the front, encountering the strong winds and overcast clouds fairly
  quickly. However, if the Transition value is large, the aircraft will
  encounter steadily stronger winds and denser clouds as it approaches the
  center of the weather area.

- Width:

  This is the width in miles of the front from side to side when approaching on
  a perpendicular course.
