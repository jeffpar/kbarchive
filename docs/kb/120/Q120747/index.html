SYMPTOMS
========

Broderbund's children's game Grandma And Me fails during installation but still
can be run.

CAUSE
=====

During installation, the application opens a file with the exclusive attribute
and then tries to open it again. Windows NT does not allow this, but MS-DOS
does. Because the installation is only creating an icon in Program Manager, its
failure does not prevent running the application.

WORKAROUND
==========

You can run the game directly from the CD using File Manager or create your own
icon.

To run the application from File Manager, select the CD-ROM drive and
double-click on the application's .EXE file.

To install an icon for the application:

1. Open Program Manager.

2. From the File menu, select New.

3. Select Program Item and fill in the path to the file as the command line. For
  instance, if the file is called GAME.EXE in the directory BIN on drive E:,
  fill in E:\BIN\GAME.EXE as the command line. You can safely leave all the
  other fields alone.

"Grandma And Me" is manufactured by Broderbund, a vendor independent of
Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise, regarding this product's
performance or reliability.
