	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes how to optimize performance in Microsoft Combat Flight
	Simulator 2: WWII Pacific Theater.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To optimize performance in Combat Flight Simulator 2, find the best balance for
	your computer between game performance and sound and video quality.
	
	Performance in Combat Flight Simulator 2 depends on both the features that you
	select and the configuration of your computer. A set of features that you select
	on one computer may not result in the same level of performance as an identical
	set of features on a different computer.
	
	A computer with a fast Pentium processor, a large amount of memory, a 3-D
	accelerator video adapter, and updated device drivers can maintain a higher
	level of performance than a computer that barely meets the minimum system
	requirements.
	
	To optimize performance in Combat Flight Simulator 2, use the following methods.
	
	Quit Unnecessary Programs
	-------------------------
	
	To increase the amount of available system resources, quit all unnecessary
	programs that are running on your computer before you start Combat Flight
	Simulator 2.
	
	To quit all unnecessary programs, use the appropriate method for your version of
	Microsoft Windows.
	
	Microsoft Windows 95 or Microsoft Windows 98:
	
	1. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE.
	
	2. In the Close Program dialog box, click any program except Explorer or Systray
	  (which are components of Microsoft Windows), and then click End Task.
	
	  If you receive a message stating that the program is busy or not responding,
	  click End Task again.
	
	3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 to quit all unnecessary programs that are running on
	  your computer.
	
	Microsoft Windows 2000:
	
	1. Press CTRL+SHIFT+ESC.
	
	2. On the Applications tab, click any program, and then click End Task.
	
	  Repeat this step to quit all unnecessary programs that are running on your
	  computer.
	
	3. Quit Windows Task Manager.
	
	NOTE: Some programs start automatically every time you restart your computer. For
	information about how to disable these programs, see the printed or online
	documentation for the program.
	
	Optimize Your Hardware Configuration
	------------------------------------
	
	To optimize your hardware configuration:
	
	1. Contact the manufacturer of your video adapter to inquire about how to obtain
	  and install the latest video driver for your video adapter.
	
	2. Contact the manufacturer of your sound card to inquire about how to obtain
	  and install the latest sound driver for your sound card.
	
	For information about how to contact the manufacturers of your video adapter and
	your sound card, click the appropriate article number below to view the article

	Configure the Program for Optimal Performance
	---------------------------------------------
	
	To configure Combat Flight Simulator 2 for optimal performance, reduce scenery
	complexity and display preferences in Combat Flight Simulator 2 to their minimum
	settings. To do this:
	
	1. On the Combat Flight Simulator 2 startup screen, click Settings.
	
	2. Click "Scenery library".
	
	3. Move the "Scenery object density" slider to the left to change the setting to
	  Sparse.
	
	4. In the "Areas list" box, click a line under the "Scenery area" column, and
	  then click Move Up or Move Down to change the Priority level for that scenery
	  area.
	
	5. Click OK.
	
	6. Under Display, click Advanced Settings.
	
	7. Click the Hardware tab.
	
	8. Make sure that the "Enable hardware acceleration" check box is selected, if
	  it is available.
	
	  If the Enable Hardware Acceleration check box is not available, your video
	  adapter may not support 3-D hardware acceleration. Contact your hardware
	  manufacturer for more information.
	
	  NOTE: Hardware acceleration may affect performance in different ways,
	  depending on the video adapter that is installed in the computer. If you
	  disable hardware acceleration in Combat Flight Simulator 2, performance may
	  improve with some video adapters, and performance may decline with other
	  video adapters.
	
	9. Click "No filtering".
	
	10. Click to clear the following check boxes:
	
	   - MIP mapping
	   - Anti-alias
	   - T and L
	
	11. In the Resolution box, click a lower resolution setting.
	
	12. Click the "Image quality" tab.
	
	13. Click to clear the following check boxes:
	
	   - Aircraft shadows
	   - Ground scenery shadows
	   - Detail texturing
	   - High detail virtual cockpit
	
	14. Move the following sliders to the left to reduce the corresponding settings:
	
	   - DEM density level
	   - Max terrain texture size
	   - Terrain complexity level
	   - Max object texture size
	   - Maximum visibility level
	   - Effects quality
	
	15. Move the "LOD target frame rate" slider to the right to increase the setting
	  to 24 FPS or higher.
	
	16. Click OK, and then click OK again.
	
	Enable Features or Increase Settings in the Program
	---------------------------------------------------
	
	To complete optimizing performance in Combat Flight Simulator 2, monitor the
	frame rate in the game as you increase one graphic quality setting or enable one
	graphic feature at a time. For information about how to change graphic settings,
	please see the "Configure the Program for Optimal Performance" method in this
	article. Start with your favorite features, and stop before the minimum frame
	rate decreases to a level that you consider unacceptable.
	
	The frame rate is the speed at which images or frames are drawn on the screen,
	and is measured in frames per second (fps). As the frame rate increases, so does
	the realism and smoothness of motion in the game.
	
	To monitor the frame rate in Combat Flight Simulator 2, press SHIFT+Z twice. The
	frame rate is displayed as a number in the upper left corner of the screen. When
	you press SHIFT+Z, Combat Flight Simulator 2 cycles through the following
	displays:
	
	- Coordinate data, heading, and speed
	- Frame rate
	- Coordinate data, heading, speed, and frame rate
	- Turn off the coordinate and frame rate display
	
	Games such as Combat Flight Simulator 2 create the illusion of motion by drawing
	a sequence of still images on the screen so rapidly that the human eye sees only
	one continuous moving picture. The illusion of motion (also known as persistance
	of vision) begins at around 15 fps. Below 15 fps, the illusion of motion breaks
	down, and the game begins to resemble a fast slide show. Most silent movies run
	at 18 fps, theatrical movies run at 24 fps, and television runs at 30 fps.
	
	NOTE: The fastest frame rate that you can achieve is determined by the refresh
	rate of your monitor. If your monitor's refresh rate is set to 72 Hz, your
	maximum viewable frame rate is 72 fps. If the calculated frame rate on your
	screen is higher than the refresh rate of your monitor, take advantage of that
	extra computing power by increasing your graphic quality settings until the
	calculated frame rate matches or falls below the refresh rate for your monitor.
	
	To determine the graphic settings that you want to increase and the graphic
	features that you want to enable, refer to the following list of graphic
	settings and features, which are sorted by their effect on performance.
	
	Settings and features that can increase performance:
	
	- Full Screen mode:

	   - Location: On the Image Quality tab of the Display Settings screen.
	   - To enable: Click to select.
	
	Settings and features that may severely affect performance:
	
	- Anti-alias:
	
	   - Description: Smooths the edges of objects in the game by rendering the
	     screen at a higher resolution than the actual screen resolution setting,
	     and then reducing the rendered image to the actual screen resolution
	     before displaying the image on the screen.
	   - Possible issues: With some 3-D video adapters, the game may quit
	     unexpectedly or stop responding (hang) when the "Anti-alias" feature is
	     enabled.
	     In addition, you may see color banding in the sky with some video adapters.
	     To resolve this issue, change the Resolution setting in the game to use a
	     32-bit color mode. For example, click "800 x 600 x 32" in the Resolution
	     box.
	   - Video support: Supported only by 3-D video adapters based on the 3Dfx
	     Voodoo5 or later chip set, the ATI Radeon or later chip set, or the nVidia
	     GeForce2 or later chip set.
	   - Location: On the Hardware tab of the Display Settings screen.
	   - To enable: Click to select.
	   - Notes: This feature can severely decrease performance.
	
	- Terrain complexity level:
	
	   - Description: Adjusts the complexity of the terrain on the screen. When you
	     decrease terrain complexity, you increase the probability that the terrain
	     displayed on the screen may not match the terrain elevation data. When you
	     increase terrain complexity, you increase the detail of the the terrain
	     displayed on the screen, and improve the accuracy of the match between the
	     terrain displayed on the screen and the terrain elevation data.
	   - Possible issues: When you set terrain complexity to a low level, you may
	     notice that the terrain shifts and pops more often as the program attempts
	     to make the terrain match the terrain elevation data. To resolve this
	     issue, increase the "Terrain complexity level" setting.
	   - Location: On the Image Quality tab of the Display Settings screen.
	   - To adjust: Move the slider to the right to increase the setting, or to the
	     left to decrease the setting.
	   - Notes: When you increase this setting, do so in small increments. This
	     setting can have a drastic effect on performance.
	
	Settings and features that you can use to acheive a specific level of performance:
	
	- LOD target frame rate:
	
	   - Description: This setting automatically adjusts the LOD for the textures
	     and objects on the screen to maintain the selected frame rate. When you
	     increase this setting, the game decreases the LOD for the textures and
	     objects on the screen to increase performance to the selected frame rate.
	     When you decrease this setting, the game increases the LOD for the
	     textures and objects on the screen to reduce performance to the selected
	     frame rate. Combat Flight Simulator 2 determines the default "LOD target
	     frame rate" setting automatically, based on your configuration.
	   - Location: On the Image Quality tab of the Display Settings screen.
	   - To adjust: Move the "LOD target frame rate" slider to the frame rate that
	     you want to use.
	   - Notes: To use this setting, you must select the "Auto-performance
	     adjustment (affects graphics)" check box on the main Settings screen in
	     Combat Flight Simulator 2.
