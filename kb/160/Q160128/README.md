	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The following information is contained in the Network Read Me file located on
	the Microsoft Close Combat compact disc.
	
	NOTE: Apple Corporation released Open Transport 1.1.1 after this Read Me file was
	created. Open Transport 1.1.1 corrects problems associated with running Open
	Transport 1.1 on certain Macintosh models. The Open Transport 1.1.1 software is
	available by contacting Apple Corporation or is available via download from the
	Apple web site:
	
	  http://www.apple.com
	
	It is recommended that you use Open Transport 1.1 or higher with System 7.5
	version 7.5.3 to connect to the Internet. Using MacTCP, as the Read Me file
	states, should not be necessary nor is it recommended.
	
	The following is the Read Me file.
	
	=============================
	Network Read Me file Contents
	
	Playing Head-To-Head Close Combat
	
	To play a two-player game in Close Combat you must have either MacTCP 2.0.6
	or Open Transport 1.1 installed.  Using Open Transport 1.1 is the
	recommended method for connecting to the Internet.  However, Open Transport
	1.1 is not available for all Macintosh models; refer to the
	"Troubleshooting Open Transport 1.1" section for more information.  Without
	Open Transport 1.1, you need to use MacTCP 2.0.6 instead.  If your
	Macintosh supports the Open Transport software and you are using System
	7.5, 7.5.1, or 7.5.2, you can obtain a System 7.5.3 upgrade from Apple
	Corporation.  This upgrade will install Open Transport 1.1.
	
	Note:  You may experience problems playing Close Combat using any
	      version of Open Transport earlier than version 1.1.  The problem
	      exists on most PCI Power Macintosh computers running System
	      7.5.2.  It is recommended that you upgrade to Open Transport 1.1
	      or later. Open Transport 1.1 can be installed from the System
	      7.5.3 upgrade.
	
	You need to know your or your opponent's IP address when playing in two-
	player mode.  To find out what your IP address is, see the section later in
	this document that pertains to your networking software.
	
	Open Transport 1.1
	
	Make sure that Open Transport 1.1 is installed.  To do this, choose Control
	Panels from the Apple menu and search for TCP/IP.  If it is not there, then
	Open Transport is not installed.  Open Transport is only available in
	System 7.5.2 or higher. To install Open Transport 1.1:
	
	Insert your System 7.5 installation CD or floppy disk 1 and launch the
	System 7.5 installer.
	
	Click Continue at the initial screen.
	
	Choose Custom Install.
	
	Click the Networking Software tab, then check Open Transport 1.1.
	
	Click Install to complete the installation.
	
	Contact your Internet Service Provider for complete instructions on how to
	install the appropriate PPP or SLIP software in order to use your modem to
	connect to the Internet.  See the "Troubleshooting Open Transport 1.1"
	section for a list of compatible PPP or SLIP software.
	
	Confirming Your IP Address
	
	When you start Close Combat and click on the two-player button, a screen
	will appear that displays your IP Address.  This is your current IP address
	that your opponent can use to establish a connection with you.
	
	If an IP address is not being displayed, then you do not have access to the
	Internet and will not be able to play Close Combat in two-player mode.  Use
	the following procedure to make sure that your Macintosh has access to the
	Internet:
	
	From the Apple menu, choose Controls Panels and then TCP/IP.
	
	In the Connect Via pop-up menu, choose your connection type.
	
	In the Setup portion of the window, enter the appropriate
	   information for your network.  This can be obtained from your
	   Internet Service Provider or your Network Administrator.
	
	From the Edit menu, choose User Mode.
	
	Select Advanced and press OK.
	
	Click the Options button.
	
	Make sure TCP/IP is active.  If you are directly connected to the
	   network, clear the Load Only When Needed check box.  If you are
	   connecting to the Internet by way of a service provider, select the
	   Load Only When Needed check box. This will load TCP/IP when you
	   connect to your service provider in step 9.
	
	Close the TCP/IP control panel, saving any changes, and then
	   restart your Macintosh.
	
	If necessary, connect to your Internet Service Provider.
	
	From the Apple menu, choose Controls Panels and then TCP/IP.  The
	   TCP/IP window should now display your IP address.
	
	Communicate your IP address to your opponent.
	
	Note: Because IP addresses often change each time you connect to the
	     Internet, you need to stay connected to the Internet if you want
	     to give your IP address to someone else. In most cases you cannot
	     disconnect, call someone with your IP address, and reconnect.
	
	Start the Close Combat program. Click the two-player button.  Your
	   IP address should now be displayed.
	
	Troubleshooting Open Transport 1.1
	
	Non-PCI Based Macintoshes
	
	With early Power Macintosh computers, Open Transport may be installed but
	will not be activated.  This will prevent the Control Panels from
	displaying the TCP/IP control panel. To activate Open Transport:
	
	Open the Apple Extras folder on the hard drive.
	
	Double-click on the Network Software Selector icon.
	
	In the Network Software Selector window, verify that the Use Open
	   Transport Networking check box is selected.  If it is not, select
	   it.
	
	Close the window and restart your Macintosh.
	
	TCP/IP should now be located in the Control Panels folder.
	
	Note: The Apple Extras is the default location for the Network Software
	     Selector program.  If you do not have this folder directly on
	     your hard drive, it may have been moved.  Try looking elsewhere
	     for the Network Software Selector program; if you still cannot
	     find it, you may need to reinstall the Open Transport software.
	
	System 7.5.2
	
	Open Transport 1.0 is included in System 7.5.2.  If you have System 7.5.2
	and are upgrading to System 7.5.3, Open Transport will be upgraded to
	version 1.1 as well.  To obtain the System 7.5.3 upgrade, contact Apple
	Corporation.
	
	Power Macintosh Compatibility
	
	As of this writing, Open Transport 1.1 cannot be active on the desktop
	5200, 5300, 6200, and the 6300 series computers. You must use MacTCP 2.0.6
	to play Close Combat in two-player mode.
	
	Connection Type Missing
	
	If your connection type is missing in the Connect Via pop-up menu, make
	sure that the software necessary to connect to your Internet Service
	Provider is properly installed, and then restart your Macintosh.
	
	Open Transport Compatibility With MacTCP mdevs
	
	Open Transport 1.1 is compatible with the following MacTCP mdevs:
	
	FreePPP - version 1.0.4 or later
	MacPPP - version 2.1.4 SD or later (version 2.2.0 is not recommended).
	InterPPP - version 1.2.9 or later
	nterPPP II - version 1.1 or later
	InterSLIP - version 1.0.1 or later
	MacSLIP - version 3.0.2 or later
	VersaTerm SLIP - version 1.1.4 or later
	Sonic PPP - version 1.0.2 or later
	AOL Link - the most current version is recommended
	
	For further help on installing the MacTCP mdevs, consult the instructions
	provided by your Internet Service Provider.
	
	MacTCP 2.0.6
	
	Make sure that MacTCP 2.0.6 is installed.  To do this, choose Control
	Panels from the Apple menu, and search for MacTCP.  If it is not there,
	then MacTCP has not been installed. To install MacTCP:
	
	Insert your System 7.5 installation CD or floppy disk 1 and launch the
	System 7.5 installer.
	
	Press Continue at the initial screen.
	
	Choose Custom Install.
	
	Click on the Networking Software tab (or Control Panels if this is
	System 7.5 Update 1), then select MacTCP.
	
	Click on Install to complete the installation.
	
	Contact your Internet Service Provider for complete instructions on how to
	install the appropriate PPP or SLIP software in order to use your modem to
	connect to the Internet.  MacTCP is compatible with many PPP or SLIP
	software, including FreePPP and MacPPP.
	
	Confirming Your IP Address
	
	When you start Close Combat and click on the two-player button, a screen
	appears that displays your IP address. This is your current IP address that
	your opponent can use to establish a connection with you.
	
	If an IP address is not being displayed, then you do not have access to the
	Internet and will not be able to play Close Combat in two-player mode.  Use
	the following procedure to make sure that your Macintosh has access to the
	Internet.
	
	From the Apple menu, choose Control Panels and then MacTCP.
	
	Choose your connection type by clicking on the appropriate icon in the
	top portion of the window.
	
	Click the More... button.
	
	In the window that appears, enter the appropriate information for your
	network.  This can be obtained from your Internet Service Provider or your
	Network Administrator.
	
	Click the OK button.
	
	Close the MacTCP window and then restart your Macintosh.
	
	If necessary, connect to your Internet Service Provider.
	
	From the Apple menu, choose Control Panels and then MacTCP.  The MacTCP
	window should now display your IP address.
	
	Communicate your IP address to your opponent.
	
	Note: Because IP addresses often change each time you connect to the
	Internet, you need to stay connected to the Internet if you want to give
	your IP address to someone else. In most cases you cannot disconnect, call
	someone with your IP address, and then reconnect.
	
	Start the Close Combat program, and click on the two-player button.
	Your IP address should now be displayed.
