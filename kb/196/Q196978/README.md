	Converting Word Documents to Lotus Word Pro
	-------------------------------------------
	
	Word Pro does not recognize Microsoft Word 97 for Windows documents. To open a
	Word 97 document in Word Pro, save the document using either the Rich Text
	Format (*.RTF) or the Word 6.0/95 (*.doc) converter from Word.
	
	Word Pro also exports the following formats that Word can read. If any of these
	(for example, WordPerfect 6.0) provide better retention of particular formats
	most important to you, use it as an alternative interim format:
	
	  RFT-DCA * (listed in Word Pro as DCA/RFT)
	  MS Windows Write 3.x
	  WordPerfect 5.1
	  WordStar 3,4,5,6,7 *
	  WordStar for Windows 1.x *
	  WordPerfect 6.x
	  MS WordPad 1.0
	  HTML (Supported for import by Word Internet Assistant)
	  Enable 4.x **
	
	  * Requires Word 97 supplemental converter.
	  ** Not supported in Word 97.
