	  Rational r2 = 2.5F;	// Implicit cast from Single to Rational
	
	
	Page 202: Initialize Should Be Initialized
	------------------------------------------

	Page 204: Void Should Be Static Void
	------------------------------------

	To:
	"...define a set accessor method for the property."
	
	
	Page 219: Delete Closing Brace
	------------------------------
	
	The code sample on page 219 contains one closing brace too many. The code sample
	should read as follows:
	
	  public void set_Age(Int32 value) {
	    If (value < 0)     // The 'value always identifies the new value.
	    throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeExceptional(
	      "Age must be greater than or equal to 0");

	      throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("numBits must be > 0");  
	
	To:
	
	  if (numBits <= 0)
	      throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException("numBits"
	           "numBits must be > 0");  
	
	
	Page 221: foreach Should Be for
	-------------------------------
	
	In the third section of the code listing after the sentence "Using the BitArray
	type's indexer...", the word "foreach" should be "for".
	
	Change:
	
	  // Show the state of all the bits by calling the get accessor.
	  foreach (Int32 x = 0; x < 14; x++) {
	
	To:
	
	  // Show the state of all the bits by calling the get accessor.
	  for (Int32 x = 0; x < 14; x++) {
	
	
	Page 222: Missing Word
	----------------------
	
	On page 222, the word "method" is missing in the first two bulleted items.
	
	In the first bullet, change:
	"...define a get accessor for the property."
	
	To:
	"...define a get accessor method for the property."
	
	In the second bullet, change:
	"...define a set accessor for the property."
	
	To:
	"...define a set accessor method for the property."
	
	
	Page 223: Changes To Code Listing
	---------------------------------
	
	On page 223, in the second code listing, there are three errors. On the first
	line, the words "SomeType" should be "BitArray", on the second line the word
	"as" should be capitalized, on the eighth line "cs.Bit(2)" should be
	"ba.Bit(2)".
	
	Change:
	
	  ' Construct an instance of the SomeType type.
	  Dim ba as new BitArray(10)
	         
	  ' Visual Basic uses ( ) instead of [ ] to specify array elements.
	  Console.WriteLine(ba(2))          'Displays True or False
	
	  'Visual Basic also allows you to access the indexer by its name.
