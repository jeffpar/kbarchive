	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	Page xvi: TOC Page Number For Index Is Incorrect
	------------------------------------------------
	
	The page number listed for the Index in the Table of Contents is incorrectly
	listed as 625. The page number for the Index should be 623.
	
	
	Page 15: 255 Is The Largest Number Represented By A Byte
	--------------------------------------------------------
	
	On page 15,
	
	Change:
	"Those who are mathematically inclined will quickly realize that 256 is the
	largest number that can be represented by a single byte."
	
	To:
	"Those who are mathematically inclined will quickly realize that 255 is the
	largest number that can be represented by a single byte."
	
	
	Page 17: Table Description Is Incorrect
	---------------------------------------
	
	On page 17, the wording at the bottom of the page should be changed as follows.
	
	Change:
	"The following table is a complete representation of the ASCII character set."
	
	To:
	"The following table shows a portion of the ASCII character set."
	
	
	Page 18: Incorrect ASCII Character Set Representation
	-----------------------------------------------------
	
	On page 18, all letters from A to Z in the right "Symbol" column should be
	lowercase.
	
	
	Page 18: Incorrect Binary For Letter D
	--------------------------------------
	
	On page 18, in the left "Symbol - Binary 1 Byte" column,
	
	Change:
	"D 01000010"
	
	To:
	"D 01000100"
	
	
	Page 41: Incorrect On And Off Information
	-----------------------------------------
	
	On page 41, line 7 from the bottom,
	
	Change:
	"The on-off state of a line gives the value of 0(on) or 1(off)."
	
	To:
	"The on-off state of a line gives the value of 0(off) or 1(on)."
	
	
	Pages 57 and 58: 1386 Should Be 80386
	-------------------------------------
	
	On page 57, in Figure 4.10, and on page 58, in Figure 4.11,
	
	Change:
	"1386"
	
	To:
	"80386"
	
	
	Page 157: Last Paragraph Incorrectly Refers To Hard Disk Head
	-------------------------------------------------------------
	
	On page 157, the last paragraph refers to a hard disk head. It should be
	referring to a hard disk platter.
	
	Change:
	"Data is stored in circular paths on the surface of each head. Each path is
	called a track. There are hundreds of tracks on the surface of each head. A set
	of tracks (all of the same diameter) through each head is called a cylinder."
	
	To:
	"Data is stored in circular paths on the surface of each platter. Each path is
	called a track. There are hundreds of tracks on the surface of each platter. A
	set of tracks (all of the same diameter) through each platter is called a
	cylinder."
	
	
	Page 317: Incorrect Statement About The Effect Of Resistance
	------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The third bulleted item on page 317 states that resistance slows the speed of an
	electrical current. This is incorrect. Resistance does not slow the speed of an
	electrical current.
	
	Change:
	"Resistance: A quality of some materials that allows them to slow the speed of an
	electrical current, producing heat, and sometimes light, in the process."
	
	To:
	"Resistance: The opposition of a body or substance to electrical current passing
	through it, resulting in a change of electrical energy into heat or another form
	of energy."
	
	
	Page 325: Correction To Step 2
	------------------------------
	
	On page 325, under "Prepare the Meter for the Test", in step 2, you should set
	the range only if the meter does not have auto range.
	
	Change:
	"If the meter does 'auto range', set the range to 15-to-20 volts."
	
	To:
	"If the meter does not have 'auto range', set the range to 15-to-20 volts."
	
	
	Page 329: Figure 13.12 Shows Incorrect Current Flow Direction
	-------------------------------------------------------------
	
	On page 329, in Figure 13.12, the current flow points to the left. The current
	flow should point to the right in this figure.
	
	
	Page 330, Figure 13.13: Incorrect Illustration Of Half-Wave Rectifier
	---------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	On page 330, Figure 13.13 does not illustrate a half-wave rectifier. Please
	disregard this figure.
	
	
	Page 576: Incorrect Information About IDE Drives
	------------------------------------------------
	
	On page 576, the last sentence in the answer to question 1 applies to EIDE
	drives, not IDE drives.
	
	Change:
	"The purpose of the IDE specification was to..."
	
	To:
	"The purpose of the EIDE specification was to..."
