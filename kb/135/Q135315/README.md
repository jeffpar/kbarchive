	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Windows 95 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	The CD-ROM Extras for Microsoft Windows 95 Upgrade includes files that are
	included in the CD-ROM version of Windows 95 but not in the floppy disk version.
	If you have the CD-ROM version of Windows 95, you do not need these files.
	
	The CD-ROM Extras for Microsoft Windows 95 Upgrade files are available in two
	ways:
	
	- By using the Microsoft Windows 95 Supplemental Offers order form in the back
	  of the "Introducing Microsoft Windows 95" manual.
	
	- By downloading from online services. For a complete list of these online
	  services, please view the Extra.txt file in the Windows folder on your hard
	  disk, or see the "How to Download CD-ROM Extras from Online Services" section
	  later in this article.
	
	If you download a supplemental file from an online service, place the file on a
	floppy disk or in a temporary folder on your hard disk, and then run it by
	double-clicking the file. These are compressed, self-extracting files that
	expand the files they contain.
	
	After you extract the files, view the Readme.txt file for specific installation
	instructions.
	
	NOTE: In some cases, you must run the self-extracting file in a specific folder.
	If this is the case, you will be prompted to do so when you double-click the
	file.
