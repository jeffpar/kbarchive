	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	International font sets that are available in Word 7.0 are not automatically
	available in Word 97.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	This is a design feature of Word 97. Word 97 makes available only the fonts that
	are usable by the language and keyboard setting in Microsoft Windows 95.
	
	RESOLUTION
	==========
	
	Follow these steps to install multilanguage support and keyboard support for a
	specific language:
	
	  Microsoft Windows 95 and Microsoft Windows 98
	
	1. Click Run, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	2. In the Control Panel, double-click Add/Remove Programs.
	
	3. Click the Windows Setup tab.
	
	4. Click the Multilanguage Support check box to select it.
	
	  NOTE: Multilanguage Support is only available if Windows 95 is installed from
	  CD-ROM.
	
	5. Click OK.
	
	6. In the Control Panel, double-click Keyboard.
	
	7. On the Language tab, click Add.
	
	8. Click the language you want to use, and then click OK.
	
	9. Click OK.
	
	  Microsoft Windows 2000
	
	1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	2. Double-click the Regional Options icon, and then click the General tab.
	
	3. In the Language Settings for the system section, select the language you want
	  to use. Click OK.
	
	4. Restart your computer for the languages to take effect.
	
	To select a specific keyboard layout, follow these steps:
	
	1. Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	2. Double-click the Keyboard icon, and then click the Input Locales tab.
	
	3. If the keyboard layout you want to use does not appear in the list of
	  installed input locales, click Add.
	
	4. In the Input Locale box, select the language you want. Click OK.
	
	5. Click Apply. Click OK.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	The font names, as viewed in Word 97, will not indicate the expected
	international font name. Word 97 will display the English font name and will map
	to the correct international font, as needed. For example, with multilanguage
	and keyboard support enabled in Windows 95, and the keyboard set to a certain
	language, such as French, Word 97 will use Arial CE, Courier New CE, or Times
	New Roman CE, but it will display the font name as either Arial, Courier New, or
	Times New Roman.
	
	The international font names previously seen in Word include the following:
	
	  Arial CE
	  Arial Cyr
	  Arial Greek
	  Courier New CE
	  Courier New Cyr
	  Courier Greek
	  Times New Roman CE
	  Times New Roman Cyr
	  Times New Roman Greek
