	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article answers the most frequently asked questions about e-mail support in
	Word 97.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	1. Q. If I use MSN, AOL, CompuServe, or Prodigy, can I use Word as my e-mail
	  editor?
	
	  A. WordMail is very much a "front end" feature. It can be used with Outlook or
	  the Windows Messaging client that comes with Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0.
	  These clients require MAPI service drivers to work with a particular online
	  service. Windows includes a driver for MSN and a CompuServe driver is
	  available from CompuServe. At present, AOL and Prodigy aren't supported.
	
	
	2. Q. Can I use templates to control the formatting and style of my WordMail
	  messages?
	
	  A. Yes. If you're using Outlook for e-mail, click Choose Template on the
	  Compose menu and double-click the template you want to use.
	
	  If you're using Exchange, click WordMail Options on the Compose menu and then
	  double-click the desired template. You can make the template you chose your
	  default template by clicking the "Set as default template" check box to
	  select it.
	
	3. Q. How do I customize the standard WordMail templates or create my own
	  WordMail templates?
	
	  A. The standard WordMail templates are located in the Office subfolder of the
	  folder you installed Word or Office to, which is c:\Program Files\Microsoft
	  Office by default. To customize one of the standard templates, do the
	  following:
	
	  a. In Word, click Open on the File menu.
	
	  b. In the "Files of type" box, click Document Template (*.dot)
	
	  c. Select the desired WordMail template from the Office folder.
	
	     If you have Macro virus protection turned on, Word will display a warning
	     message that informs you that there are macros in the template. Click the
	     Enable Macros button.
	
	  d. Make your modifications and save the template.
	
	  You can create a custom WordMail template by opening one of the templates in
	  the WordMail folder and saving a copy of it under a new file name. To do
	  this, follow steps a-c above, click Save As on the file menu and type a new
	  name for the template.
	
	  If you are using Microsoft Exchange, you can add a custom template to the list
	  of available templates as follows:
	
	  a. On the Compose menu, click WordMail Options.
	
	  b. Click the Add button.
	
	  c. Locate the template and double-click it.
	
	4. Q. When I installed Office 97 it changed my Exchange or Windows Messaging
	  e-mail editor. How do I get back the editor I'm used to?
	
	  A. If you did not install Outlook and you have Exchange or Windows Messaging
	  on your computer, WordMail for Exchange will be installed. To turn off
	  WordMail in Exchange, do the following:
	
	  a. On the Compose menu, click WordMail Options.
	
	     Note: If you do not see this menu item, you are using Outlook, not
	     Exchange.
	
	  b. Click the "Enable WordMail as Email Editor" check box to select it.
	
	  c. Click Close
	
	  If you did install Outlook with Office, Outlook will replace the functionality
	  of Exchange or Windows Messaging, and Schedule+. You should double-click the
	  Outlook shortcut on your desktop, instead of the Inbox icon. Opening a mail
	  message from Exchange will cause Outlook to run, resulting in an Outlook
	  WordMail message. If you want to continue using Exchange instead of Outlook,
	  run Setup and remove Outlook, then re-install Exchange or Windows Messaging.

	5. Q. Can I send and route documents to co-workers from within Microsoft Word if
	  my organization is using Lotus cc:Mail?
	
	  A. If you are using Lotus cc:Mail in your organization, you will be able to
	  send documents to co-workers from within Word. To do this, point to Send To
	  on the File menu and then click Mail Recipient.
