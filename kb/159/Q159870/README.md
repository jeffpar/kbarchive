	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	1. Q. What are the system requirements to install and run MSN? A. The system
	  requirements include the following:
	
	  - Windows 95
	
	  - A personal computer with a 486/66 or higher processor
	
	  - 14.4 Kbps or higher modem
	
	  - 8 MB of memory required, 16 MB recommended
	
	  - 50 MB available hard disk space
	
	  - CD-ROM drive (2x or higher)
	
	  - VGA or higher resolution graphics card
	
	  - Sound card recommended
	
	  - Microsoft Mouse or compatible pointing device
	
	  To fully experience MSN, you need a sound card and speakers. MSN will function
	  properly without them, but audio is integral to the full experience. Also,
	  the MSN Preview program included on the CD-ROM uses audio extensively and
	  will not be useful if you do not have sound capabilities.
	
	2. Q. What is on the MSN CD-ROM?
	
	  A. There are three items on the CD-ROM:
	
	  - MSN Preview: A multimedia preview of the new MSN. It explains some of MSN's
	  features and what you can expect as a member.
	
	  - MSN Setup: A program to install and configure the software necessary to
	  access the new MSN.
	
	  - The Connection Troubleshooter.
	
	3. Q. What if I have problems with installation?
	
	  A. One way to fix problems you encounter is to quit the program, remove the
	  CD-ROM from your CD-ROM drive, and then reinsert it. As the MSN CD-ROM starts
	  up again, it should be able to fix most problems you might have encountered.
	  If it does not, see the Tips And Trouble- shooting section of Help.
	
	4. Q. Why doesn't anything happen when I insert the MSN CD-ROM into the CD-ROM
	  drive?
	
	  A. AutoPlay is a Windows 95 feature that automatically starts a program when
	  you put its CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive. If the MSN CD-ROM does not start
	  automatically, your CD-ROM driver does not support AutoPlay, or the AutoPlay
	  feature is disabled.
	
	  To start the MSN CD-ROM manually, follow these steps:
	  1. Insert the MSN CD-ROM in the CD-ROM drive.
	
	  2. Click the Start button, and then click Run.
	
	  3. In the Open box, type the following line &lt;drive&gt;:\msnstart
	     where &lt;drive&gt; is the drive letter of the CD-ROM drive.
	
	  4. Click OK.
	
	5. Q. What are the video card and display requirements for MSN?
	
	  A. The MSN CD-ROM will not run if your display is set to 16-color mode. It is
	  designed to run at 640 x 480 resolution, or higher, with a minimum of 256
	  colors. If your display is set to show 16 colors, change your display setting
	  to show 256 colors or more using these steps:
	  1. In Control Panel, double-click Display.
	
	  2. Click the Settings tab.
	
	  3. In the Color Palette box, click 256 colors or anything higher than 16
	     colors, and then click OK.
	
	     Some video cards may encounter problems using accelerated video drivers,
	     video drivers with more than 256 colors, or high resolution video drivers.
	     If you run into display problems, try one of the following tips:
	
	  - Switch to a driver supplied with Windows 95.
	
	  - Change to a different display mode. An alternative to using a different
	  driver is to change your video mode to a standard video mode such as 640 x
	  480 resolution with 256 colors.
	
	     For details on how to change drivers or switch to a different display mode,
	     see your Windows 95 documentation.
	
	     NOTE: NEC computers using the Alliance Promotion video card do not work
	     well with the MSN CD-ROM. Please contact your computer dealer for
	     assistance.
	
	6. Q. When I try to install the Interactive Music Architecture, I receive the
	  error message
	
	  "MSNAUDIO.ACM is in use."
	
	  A. If you receive this error message, click Cancel. MSN Setup should continue
	  without a problem.
	
	7. Q. Why doesn't a shortcut to the MSN Program Viewer show up on my desktop
	  after I install MSN?
	
	  A. The shortcut will probably appear when you restart your computer. If
	  necessary, you can create a shortcut to the MSN Program Viewer with the
	  following steps:
	  1. Click Start, point to Find, and then click Files Or Folders.
	
	  2. In the Named box, type:
	
	  "msnviewr.exe" (without the quotation marks)
	
	  3. Click Find Now.
	
	  4. Right-click the Msnviewr.exe file, and then click Create Shortcut.
	
	  5. Click Yes to place the shortcut on the desktop.
	
	8. Q. Why doesn't the MSN Program Viewer open when I double-click the icon on my
	  desktop?
	
	  A. An error occurred during MSN Setup. Please follow these steps:
	  1. Restart your computer.
	
	  2. Double-click the MSN Program Viewer icon. If it does not open, you need to
	     reinstall MSN.
	
	  3. Disable any anti-virus or TSR software running on your computer.
	
	  4. Insert the MSN CD-ROM in the CD-ROM drive. The CD-ROM will walk you
	     through MSN Setup again.
	
	9. Q. Where are the MSN program files located on my computer after I install
	  MSN?
	
	  A. Most MSN files need to be stored on your computer's system drive. This is
	  the drive from which your computer boots (usually drive C:).
	
	  If you do not have enough space on your system drive, MSN Setup will notify
	  you and provide an Expert option. If you select Expert installation, you will
	  be prompted several times during installation for an alternative storage area
	  (that is, other than your system drive).
	
	10. Q. What happens if I cancel the Internet Connection Wizard during Setup?
	
	  A. If you cancel the Internet Connection Wizard while setting up MSN, you
	  must start MSN Setup again.
