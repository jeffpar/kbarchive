## Q166833: SMS: Failed Status MIF Does Not Update Job Status

	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Systems Management Server version 1.2

	SYMPTOMS
	========
	
	The Package Command Manager (PCM) status MIF contains an InstallStatus Group
	that has two attributes: Status and Description. If the Status attribute is set
	to "Failed", the status in the job detail does not reflect a job failure, but
	rather a "retrying" status.
	
	CAUSE
	=====
	
	If a program writes a .mif file to the Windows directory, Package Command
	Manager collects the file and places it in the Despoolr.box directory specified
	by the ResultsSharePoint entry in the client's Sms.ini file. The date and time
	of the .mif file must be later than the date and time specified for the job
	start time, or Package Command Manager will not collect the file.
	
	The Status attribute set in the status .mif file determines the status reported
	back to the originating site. If a job has a status of Failed, Systems
	Management Server should perform the following steps:
	
	1. Change the site job status to "Retrying". The job will eventually fail after
	  a period of time.
	
	2. Write an event in the site server's Event Log. The Event ID is 374, and the
	  Description is:
	
	        The workstation install job has failed on workstation <machine name>
	        in Domain <domain name>, the description generated by the setup
	        script is <text entered in the Description attribute of the Status
	        MIF>.
	
	        MachineName = <Machine Name>
	        SiteCode = <Site Code>
	        Component = SMS_DESPOOLER
	        JobID = <Job ID>
	        JobDestination = <Site Code>"
	
	STATUS
	======
	
	Microsoft has confirmed this to be a problem in Systems Management Server
	version 1.2. We are researching this problem and will post new information here
	in the Microsoft Knowledge Base as it becomes available.
