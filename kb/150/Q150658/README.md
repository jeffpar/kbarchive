	regarding Microsoft products and are unable to respond directly to each
	one. However, be assured that your recommendations, ideas, and remarks
	are recorded and will help shape future versions of our Mastering Series
	products.
	
	2  Problems During Setup
	The Setup program's default settings will load the Mastering Access
	Programming title to your C: drive. You can assign application files to
	a different drive; however, Setup will copy as much as 8.5 MB of system
	files to your WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory.
	
	Setup will not complete properly if you remove the Mastering Access
	Programming CD-ROM during Setup, or attempt to start the application
	before Setup is complete.
	
	Because Mastering Access Programming installs system files that may be
	shared with other applications, you must shut down other applications,
	including Microsoft Office, before running Setup. If you have closed all
	other open applications and you encounter problems during Setup, make
	sure your system meets the minimum requirements necessary to install
	Mastering Access Programming.
	
	System Requirements
	Mastering Microsoft Access Programming will run on the following minimal
	system; however, performance will improve with more RAM or a faster
	CD-ROM drive.
	
	<B7>  Personal computer with a 486DX or higher processor running Windows
	  95, or Microsoft Windows NT Workstation 3.51 or later
	<B7>  8 MB of memory (16 MB or more recommended)
	<B7>  10 MB of available hard-disk space (15 MB to work with lab files on
	  your hard disk)
	<B7>  MPC2-compatible CD-ROM drive
	<B7>  Super VGA or higher-resolution video adapter capable of displaying
	  256 colors or greater
	<B7>  Microsoft Mouse or compatible pointing device
	<B7>  MPC2-compatible audio board for audio and video instruction
	<B7>  Microsoft Access 95 is required to work the lab exercises.
	
	3  Removing Mastering Access Programming
	To remove Mastering Access Programming from your computer, run Setup again
	and choose the Remove All option. (This removes only files specific to
	Mastering Access Programming. Shared files installed in the Windows
	System directory, such as DLLs, OCXs, and DRVs, are not removed.) If
	using Windows 95, you can also uninstall Mastering Access Programming by
	choosing the Add/Remove Programs application in the Control Panel. You
	may also need to do the following:
	
	<B7>  Delete the Mastering Access Programming icon. If you moved the icon
	to a different program group since installing the application, Setup
	will not be able to detect the new location of the icon and cannot
	delete it. After running Setup (with Remove All selected), go to Program
	Manager and delete the icon(s).
	
	 If you are running Windows 95 and have created any shortcuts, you will
	need to manually delete them to completely remove references to the
	title.
	
	<B7>  Delete the MACC directory. The MACC directory (or the directory you
	specified as the destination directory during Setup) will not be removed.
	If this directory is not being used for other files, you can delete it by
	opening File Manager or Explorer, selecting the directory, and then
	pressing DELETE.
	
	4  Potential Problems Running this Title
	This section describes problems you may experience when running Mastering
	Access Programming.
	
	<B7>  Content: Some of the articles located in the product's Library are
	based on pre-released versions of Microsoft Access 95. There may be
	discrepancies between information referenced in these sources and in
	the released version of Microsoft Access 95. Library articles included
	in this title are not edited by the Mastering Access Programming team.
	You may encounter documentation errors, references to page numbers or
	files, and formatting problems. Addresses, phone numbers, and other
	contact information appearing in this title may have changed since the
	time of publication. Finally, some of the topic titles in the application
	may be cut off when running Mastering Access Programming in lower display
	resolutions.
	
	<B7>  Graphics: This title is designed to run on machines capable of
	displaying 256 colors or more. Though the title does run on systems
	displaying 16 colors, there is a noticeable drop in image quality. Some
	large graphics may display out of the window when running the title at
	640 x 480 resolution. It is recommended that you run this application in
	800 x 600 mode or greater. The graphic viewer in this application allows
	you to toggle graphics between large and small views. By clicking on the
	viewer, you can change the size of the graphic. The viewer will remain
	the size that you last viewed a graphic. If an image appears distorted
	or compressed, click in the graphic viewer to make sure you are viewing
	the entire image. Note that some small graphics do not change size.
	
	<B7>  Navigation and Topic areas:  If using keyboard keys to navigate
	through the Table of Contents or the Topic area, you may need to manually
	change the focus of the application, depending on the content you want
	to affect. You can change the focus by clicking on the area you want to
	navigate. On some systems, the vertical scroll bar may change size when
	scrolling through topics and labs, or navigating through the Table of
	Contents.
	
	<B7>  Palette Flash:  Palette flashes can occur when switching between
	  Mastering Access Programming and other running applications.
	
	<B7>  Printing: The media represented by icons in the text area (graphics,
	sample code, tips, and answers) will not print when printing the current
	screen. To print this information, choose Print when the media is
	displayed in the active window. If you experience problems printing over
	a network, consult your network administrator to make sure your printer
	settings are correct. Solutions for common printing problems are
	described in section 9, "Printing Problems." If you choose to print the
	Glossary, the entire Glossary will be printed.
	
	<B7>  Stay On Top Mode: Stay On Top mode provides a great way to look at
	Lab information or view content while working in another application
	(such as Microsoft Access). However, when using Mastering Access
	Programming in Stay On Top mode, Glossary Popups, ToolTips for the
	ToolBar, and the Print dialog box all appear behind the application.
	
	<B7>  Text: Mastering Access Programming uses your system settings to
	display some foreground and background colors. You may want to choose a
	compatible display combination (such as the Windows Standard color
	scheme) for best visual results. When displaying glossary popups within
	the text, the application will sometimes lose focus. To remedy this,
	click in the Topic area; focus will return to the application.
	
	<B7>  Video: .AVI files will only run if you've installed the Multimedia
	options (when setting up Windows 95) or Microsoft Video for Windows
	(installed on your system when running Windows NT). Setup will look for
	multimedia options on your system and notify you if they are not
	installed. If this is the case, you will need to install the appropriate
	options. Even with appropriate hardware, you may experience long wait
	times while video files are being loaded, and you may have errors in
	video/audio synchronization during playback.
	
	<B7>  Windows NT version 3.51: The ALT+TAB key combination will not restore
	the Mastering Access Programming application when minimized; you'll have
	to use the mouse to restore the application to a visible state.
	
	5  Sample Applications
	There are numerous sample applications that illustrate the concepts and
	techniques taught in the demos in the title. You can open the
	applications in the MEDIA\FILES directory on the CD and review the code
	yourself. In addition, there are several Map files (with a .WMF
	extension) that provide detailed technical information about Microsoft
	Office products. Included in the same directory is an application
	(MAPVIEW.EXE) that can be used to view these Map files.
	
	6  Performance Issues
	There are several ways to make Mastering Access Programming run faster.
	Many of the methods described below are general tips that will improve
	the performance of any application under Windows. Consult your Windows
	manual for more details.
	Mastering Access Programming uses your computer's random access memory
	(RAM) to display pictures and play video and audio. If Mastering Access
	Programming runs slowly or if you get error messages saying you are out
	of memory, you may not have enough RAM available. Here are some tips to
	make the best use of available memory:
	
	<B7>  Close all applications that you are not using.
	
	<B7>  Add more RAM (memory) to your computer. You can determine how much
	memory is available by starting MS-DOS, typing mem and pressing ENTER.
	This program will tell you how much memory you have. You need at least
	10 MB of RAM, and 16 MB is recommended.
	
	<B7>  If you are using more than 256 colors in your video display, you may
	want to lower your video colors to 256. For instructions on how to
	change your Windows display, consult your Windows documentation.
	
	For more details on improving performance, consult your Windows and
	CD-ROM manuals.
	
	7  Hardware Problems
	Mastering Access Programming is designed to run at VGA (640 x 480) or
	higher, with 256 colors. Though Mastering Access Programming will run in
	16-color mode, there will be a noticeable drop in image quality.
	
	Mastering Access Programming may encounter display problems when using
	accelerated video drivers, video drivers with more than 256 colors, or
	high-resolution video drivers. One example of these problems is a video
	display with garbled images. Another is a crash occurring when trying to
	play a video. There are several things you can do if you encounter such
	problems:
	
	1.  Most problems can be fixed by obtaining new drivers from your video
	card manufacturer. Contact the manufacturer of your video card to
	determine if newer versions are available. The manufacturer's phone
	number should be in the manuals that came with your video card or
	personal computer. Another option for obtaining updated drivers is the
	Microsoft Download service (MSDL), an electronic bulletin board that can
	be accessed by modem at (425) 936-MSDL (425-936-6735).
	
	Drivers provided on MSDL are compressed with the PKWare utilities and
	are in the form of executable files (.EXE extension). It is best to
	download the file or files you need into an empty directory on your hard
	disk or a blank formatted floppy. To decompress these drivers after
	downloading them:
	
	a)  From Windows NT File Manager or Windows 95 Explorer, double-click
	on the filename that you downloaded.
	
	-or-
	
	b)  From the MS-DOS prompt, change to the directory containing the
	   downloaded file, type the filename, and then press ENTER.
	
	2.  An alternative to obtaining a new or updated display driver is to
	change your video mode to a standard video mode, such as 640 x 480
	resolution with 256 colors.
	
	To find out what video driver you are using, open Display from Control
	Panel. In Windows 95, click the Settings tab. Then click the Change
	Display Type button. Your display type will be listed there. For
	instructions on how to install or change drivers, click the Help button.
	
	8  Printing Problems
	Screen resolution and printer resolution are often not the same, so the
	resulting printout may not match the quality you see on the screen.
	
	If you encounter a general protection fault when you print a topic,
	check your printer driver. Switch to a more current version of the
	driver, if one is available. Additionally, ensure that the printer is
	online and that you can print to it from another application. If the
	problem persists, one of the following procedures may solve the problem:
	
	In Windows NT:
	<B7>  In the Control Panel, double-click the Fonts icon. Click the TrueType
	  button in the Fonts dialog box, and turn off the Enable TrueType
	  Fonts option.
	
	<B7>  In the Control Panel, choose Setup and Options for your printer. Turn
	  off the Color option, and restart Windows.
	
	In Windows 95:
	<B7>  Click on the Property page for the Printer you are using. Choose the
	  Fonts tab and click on the method of downloading TrueType fonts that
	  works best with your system.
	
	If you are using an HP LaserJet printer, make sure that you have the
	most current printer driver or try setting the printer resolution to 300
	dpi. (Graphics may not print properly at 600 dpi.)
	
	You should be able to print grayscale images from Mastering Access
	Programming. If you have a black and white laser printer, you may need
	to upgrade your printer driver. Call the dealer from whom you bought
	the printer, or call the printer manufacturer.
