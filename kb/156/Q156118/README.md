	ABOUT MANIC MARBLES
	-------------------
	
	Microsoft Marbles is a wacky three-dimensional game where bizarre marbles
	characters try to knock, and avoid being knocked off different playing fields.
	The trick is the playing fields are out to get you too. Up to four people can
	play on one computer with the Microsoft SideWinder Game pad. Each marble has
	special offensive and defensive capabilities. Every marble has the ability to
	charge at an opponent. Also each player has the ability to jump. The jump option
	helps you avoid charging marbles or playing field objects. In addition to theses
	core abilities, each marble has its own unique abilities. For information about
	the Manic Marbles characters, see the following article in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base:

	TIPS ON PLAYING
	---------------
	
	The following are basic tips on how to play Manic Marbles trial version:
	
	- Move your player around the field by pressing the D button on your Sidewinder
	  Game pad.
	
	- Avoid other players and obstacles by moving and jumping.
	
	- Use your character's special offensive and defensive options to knock your
	  opponents off the playing field or into danger areas.
	
	- Keep moving, you'll be tougher to hit.
	
	- If someone charges at you, try to jump out of the way.
	
	- Know the danger areas on each playing field.
	
	- Know your opponents strengths and weaknesses.
	
	- Don't stand by danger areas for too long (see the "Danger Areas" section in
	  this article for more information).
	
	Win all three games to become the Microsoft Marbles champion. You can change the
	number of wins, difficulty, level choice and volume in the "Options" section of
	the game.
	
	Game Setup:
	
	In Game Setup you can change the following items:
	
	- Number of players, human or computer
	
	- Multi-player or Team
	
	- Input device selection (Game pad, Keyboard)
	
	- Input configuration
	
	Danger Areas:
	
	Every playing field has special marks to help the player recognize safe and
	dangerous areas. At the start of each round, all areas of the playing fields are
	safe for 5 seconds. Before the end of the 5 seconds, the danger areas will start
	flashing to warn the players that they are about to turn on. This helps players
	from dying very quickly at the beginning of the game.
	
	Green Stripes:
	
	A green glow along the edge of a playing field indicates a safe area. If an edge
	is marked by a green glow, you will not fall off the edge of the playing field.
	
	Black/White Stripes:
	
	Yellow and black stripes indicate possible danger. These stripes indicate areas
	that could harm your marble. These stripes surround breakaway glass, collapsing
	walls, and fences.
	
	Yellow/Black Stripes:
	
	Yellow and black stripes indicate danger. Your marble will be harmed if it enters
	these areas. These stripes surround ends of playing fields, lava pits, trap
	doors.
	
	Second Chance Controls:
	
	One of the great features of Microsoft Marbles is that you are never out of the
	game. Even if your marble falls off the playing field, you still can play, using
	the power of Second Chance control. Every playing field has special Second
	Chance controls. These include controlling trap doors, pinball bumpers, and
	elevators. You can't personally win a round using Second Chance controls, but in
	Team Mode you can help your teammate win the round and get the point for your
	team. (See each individual playing field for individual Second Chance control).
