	1. Dual-Installation Product
	
	Your Explorapedia disk includes two versions of Explorapedia:
	
	* A 16-bit version for Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups 3.11
	* A 32-bit version for Windows 95 and Windows NT 3.51 and later.
	
	Setup installs the appropriate Explorapedia software for your
	system. The version for Windows 95 and Windows NT is most
	appropriate for those operating systems, so if you upgrade your
	Windows 3.1, you should also re-run Explorapedia Setup to update
	your application.
	
	2. Problems During Setup
	
	Because Explorapedia installs system files that may be shared with
	other applications, it is best to close other applications before
	setting up.
	
	If Setup is interrupted by a loss of power, a power surge, or some
	other unexpected incident, restart Microsoft Windows before you run
	Setup again.
	
	Refer to your Explorapedia User's Guide to find out about minimum
	system requirements.
	
	If you receive the error message "WinG has encountered a problem
	with your video display driver. Contact the manufacturer of your
	video card to obtain the most recent driver. Your WinG applications
	will still run, but at reduced speed,"  it most likely means that
	you have old video drivers. Check the documentation that came with
	your video card or computer to find out where you can get the latest
	video drivers for your system. Refer to Section 5, "Video Cards and
	Display Problems" in this document for more information about how to
	obtain more recent drivers.
	
	MISSING AUDIO/VIDEO COMPRESSION DRIVERS
	The Windows 95/Windows NT versions of Explorapedia require certain
	video and audio compression software to be preinstalled on your
	system. This software comes standard with Windows 95 and Windows NT,
	but can be removed during Windows Setup or using the Control Panel
	Drivers application.
	
	On Windows 95, Explorapedia Setup will automatically run Windows
	Setup to install the required components. Windows Setup will prompt
	you to insert your original installation media (CD-ROM disc or
	diskettes) before proceeding with the driver installation.
	
	On Windows NT, Explorapedia Setup will prompt you to run the Control
	Panel Drivers application to add the deleted components. You can
	switch out of Explorapedia Setup, run Control Panel, and add each
	driver that is missing. You don't have to restart Windows NT each
	time you add a driver; just click "Don't Restart Now," switch back
	to Explorapedia Setup, and continue until all the required drivers
	have been added. To ensure the drivers were properly installed, you
	should then restart Windows NT before running Explorapedia for the
	first time.
	
	SETUP INITIALIZATION ERROR ON WINDOWS NT
	If you get a "Setup Initialization Error" claiming "insufficient
	memory or disk space to run Setup," click the "Run in Separate Memory
	Space" option in the File-Run menu option in Program Manager/Start
	Menu.
	
	3. General Tips
	
	AUTOPLAY ON WINDOWS 95
	On Windows 95, Explorapedia automatically starts when you insert the
	disc in the CD-ROM drive. To avoid Autoplay, hold down the SHIFT key
	while you insert the disc.
	
	HELP FROM TAD
	You can always press the F1 key on your keyboard to get help from Tad.
	
	FINDING THINGS
	Using "Find a certain word" is a quick alternative to get to any
	topic. Click on Find in the ship or on the Exploratron (or click on
	Tad and then click on "Find something"), and then click on "A
	certain word" on the list.
	
	SHIP'S WINDOW
	The labels at the top of the ship window (which change as you move
	the cursor) correspond to the different scenes in Explorapedia.
	
	CHANGING SETTINGS
	To change audio settings, Little Kid's Mode, scene actions, and/or
	color of leap words, click the "Settings" button in the ship, or
	click on Tad to see a list of options.
	
	CONNECTING TO A WRITING OR PAINTING APPLICATION
	There are three ways to establish connections to a Writing or
	Painting application:
	
	  1. Click on the notepad or easel in the ship. This is the most
	     direct way to connect to the application.
	
	  2. Click the "Settings" button in the ship. Then, choose
	     "Connections to writing or painting programs."
	
	  3. Click on Tad, and then choose "Something else," then "Change
	     Settings," and finally "Connections to writing or painting
	     programs."
	
	Once you've reached the "Stand by. I'll connect you to your program"
	bubble, you must next click the "Connect" button.  A dialog box will
	appear. By selecting an executable program (a file with an .EXE file
	extension) and clicking OK, you will establish the connection.
	Subsequent clicks on the appropriate icon will IMMEDIATELY start that
	application.
	
	On Windows 95, don't connect to the Write.Exe or Pbrush.Exe files
	located in the Windows directory. Instead, use the WordPad.Exe and
	MSPaint.Exe files located in the \Program Files\Accessories folder.
	
	4. Explorapedia and Windows Performance Issues
	
	There are several ways to make Explorapedia run faster. Many of the
	methods described below are general tips to improve the performance
	of any Windows application. Consult your Windows user's guide for
	more details.
	
	Microsoft Explorapedia uses your computer's memory (RAM) to display
	pictures and play animations and sound. If Explorapedia runs slowly
	or you see "out-of-memory" errors, Explorapedia may not have enough
	memory. Below are some tips to make the best use of your available
	memory.
	
	* Close all applications that you are not using.
	
	* On Windows 3.1 and 3.11, set up a permanent Windows swap file.
	
	  Windows works best when there is hard disk space allocated for
	  swapping a file into or out of your computer's memory.  To set
	  up a permanent Windows swap file on your hard disk, open Control
	  Panel (usually in the Main group of Program Manager), and then
	  click 386 Enhanced. Click the Virtual Memory button to see if
	  your current swap file is temporary or permanent, to check the
	  size of the current swap file, and to make changes. Windows
	  usually creates a temporary swap file by default, but if your
	  disk is full or fragmented, this temporary file may be
	  unavailable. If you can, make the size of the permanent swap
	  file at least 8192 KB.
	
	  Look at the Help menu in Control Panel or in your Windows
	  documentation for more information.
	
	* Defragment or optimize your hard disk by running a defragmentation
	 program.
	
	  For example, Windows 95 includes a utility called Disk
	  Defragmenter, installed under the Accessories-System Tools start
	  menu. Some other popular utilities are PC Tools, Norton Utilities,
	  and Mace Utilities.
	
	* Add more RAM (memory) to your computer. You need at least 4
	 megabytes (sometimes listed as 4096 kilobytes or KB) of RAM, and 8
	 megabytes is recommended. To determine how much memory is on your
	 computer, use the following procedures:
	
	  On Windows 95: Click the Start button, choose Settings, and
	  double-click the System icon in Control Panel. Click the
	  Performance tab and look at the memory and system resources
	  settings.
	
	  On Windows 3.1: Start an MS-DOS command box. From the command
	  line, type mem and press ENTER. This displays various memory
	  statistics including "Total Memory."
	
	* Add a cache to your CD-ROM drive.
	
	  On Windows 95, the CD-ROM drive is generally cached automatically.
	  See your Windows 95 documentation for details.
	
	  SmartDrive in MS-DOS 6.2 and utilities such as Norton Speedcache+
	  can significantly improve the performance of CD-ROM products by
	  helping to eliminate unnecessary seeks and reads. If you have an
	  older or slow CD-ROM drive, the performance difference is very
	  noticeable.
	
	* Run Microsoft MemMaker from MS-DOS.
	
	  MS-DOS versions 6.0 and later feature a utility called MemMaker
	  that can increase the amount of low memory available to
	  applications. This can improve the performance of many Windows
	  applications as well as MS-DOS applications. Refer to your MS-DOS
	  user's guide  for more information on MemMaker.
	
	For more details on improving performance, consult your Windows and
	CD-ROM manuals.
	
	5. Video Cards and Display Problems
	
	Explorapedia does not run in the 16-color mode provided by standard
	VGA video drivers. Explorapedia requires a minimum 256-color display.
	Fortunately, most video cards support the 256-color mode, provided
	you use the correct video driver within Windows.
	
	Windows 95 does a good job of detecting 256-color video cards and
	installing the appropriate driver software. If you're running
	Windows 95, you can check for 256-color mode by checking Display
	Settings. Just right-click your desktop and choose Properties from
	the menu. Click the Settings tab and click the arrow on the Color
	Palette box. You will see the various color settings available on
	your system. Select the 256-color setting.
	
	On Windows 3.1, unless you have a VGA-only video card or monitor,
	you can change your display to 256 colors. Your system may already
	have a driver installed that displays 256 colors or more. For
	instructions on how to determine what video driver you have installed
	and how to install or change drivers, go to the Help menu in Windows
	Setup. To get there, click Windows Setup, usually in the Main group
	of Program Manager.
	
	AUTOMATIC RESOLUTION SWITCHING ON WINDOWS 95
	The artwork in Explorapedia was designed to fit on a 640x480 screen.
	If you are running in higher resolution modes, such as 1024x768, the
	artwork will appear smaller. On 256-color displays, the 32-bit
	version of Explorapedia automatically switches to 640x480 resolution
	when started. It switches back to the higher resolution when closed,
	or when you switch to another application while the product is
	running.
	
	  To disable the automatic resolution switching:
	
	    1. Click the Start menu, and choose Run.
	
	    2. Type "regedit" as the program name, and click OK. This
	       starts the Registry Editor.
	
	    3. The left side of the application looks like a directory of
	       folders. Browse into the following folder:
	
	    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft Kids\Explorapedia
	
	    4. Double-click the "SwitchResolution" entry on the right side
	       of the window.
	
	    5. In Value Data, type 0 (zero).
	
	    6. Click OK and exit Registry Editor.
	
	MISSING VIDEO COMPRESSION DRIVERS
	If you see a "video not available" message in place of that cool
	Exploratron video you were hoping to see, you may have lost a video
	compression driver. Just re-run Explorapedia Setup to restore the
	missing driver. You might be prompted to insert your Windows Setup
	disc to complete Setup.
	
	OTHER VIDEO DISPLAY PROBLEMS
	In some situations, Explorapedia may encounter video display
	problems when using high-resolution video drivers from various
	video-card manufacturers.
	
	There are several things you can do if you encounter problems like
	this:
	
	* Obtain updated drivers from your video-card manufacturer
	
	  Most problems can be fixed by obtaining new drivers from your
	  video-card manufacturer. Contact the manufacturer of your video
	  card to determine if there are newer versions available. The
	  company's phone number should be in the manuals that came with your
	  video card or personal computer. Another option for obtaining
	  updated drivers is the Microsoft Download service, an electronic
	  bulletin board that can be accessed via a modem at (425) 936-MSDL
	  (425-936-6735).
	
	* Change to a different display mode
	
	An alternative to obtaining a new or updated display driver is to
	change your video mode to a standard video mode, such as 640 x 480
	resolution with 256 colors.
	
	6. Audio Problems
	
	The following are some suggested solutions for common problems with
	audio in Explorapedia. The first step is to determine whether ANY
	audio is playing within Windows.
	
	SOUND DOES NOT PLAY AT ALL
	Check the following common problems.
	
	  1. Check the volume. Make sure it's turned up high enough to hear.
	     Also, make sure your speakers are plugged into the correct port
	     on the back of the sound card.
	
	  2. If the volume is turned up and you still hear no sounds,
	     something may be wrong with your audio card installation. Check
	     to see that the audio card software is installed correctly, and
	     reinstall it if necessary.
	
	  3. If the software is installed correctly, the audio card may need
	     to be pressed more securely into its slot or have a jumper
	     setting changed.
	
	  4. If you have both an audio card and special software that
	     bypasses the audio card to play sounds through the PC speaker,
	     we suggest you remove or disable the special software (the PC
	     speaker driver). Explorapedia requires an MPC-compatible audio
	     card; it is not meant to run with just the PC internal speaker
	     or any combination of that speaker and special software.
	
	  5. Some audio compression drivers may have been accidentally
	     deleted from your system. Re-install Explorapedia by running
	     Setup. Setup will restore the drivers or tell you how to restore
	     them yourself.
	
	SOUND PLAYS BUT IS DISTORTED OR "FUZZY"
	Sound distortion is often caused by sending a higher volume or
	amplitude of sound than the speakers are able to handle. Also, if
	the volume control on your audio card is set too high it may cause
	distortion from the amplifier on the audio card. Sometimes lower-
	quality speakers will distort at a lower volume than better speakers
	will (compare a clock radio speaker to a big stereo system; the
	stereo speakers can play much louder with no distortion). For
	example, if the volume for your audio card or "WAVE file output" is
	set to near its maximum it will produce distortion just like a radio
	with the volume turned up too high. To learn how to change your
	audio-card settings, check the manuals that came with your audio
	card. Changing the volume settings is normally done either with a
	volume dial on the back of your audio card (in the back of your
	computer where the speakers plug in) or with a program that is
	often called a "mixer" (usually found in Control Panel in the Main
	group). Some audio cards use both types of controls, and they must
	both be adjusted.
	
	Another possible cause of distortion is that you are using a 16-bit
	sound card set to a lower Direct Memory Access (DMA). Sounds that
	appear scratchy while using a low DMA will sound better using a
	higher DMA. In the case of the Media Vision Pro Audio 16 sound card,
	a DMA setting of 7 will correct any scratchy sounds. To change the
	DMA channel, go to Control Panel and choose Drivers. In the Drivers
	section, select the sound card driver and then choose Setup. You
	should be able to select a higher DMA setting here. If the driver
	will not allow you to change the DMA setting, refer to your
	sound-card manual.
	
	SOUND PLAYS BUT HAS SKIPS
	If audio breaks up or skips periodically, it is usually an
	indication that the CD-ROM drive does not fully meet the MPC
	(Multimedia PC) specification for the Data Transfer Rate. Since
	Explorapedia requires a double-speed CD-ROM drive, any audio
	skipping or breakup should be minimal. If you are trying to run
	Explorapedia with a single-speed drive, you may experience audio
	loss during videos and animations.
	
	SOUNDS ARE CUT OFF
	Most audio cards can play only one sound at a time; therefore,
	other sound-producing applications could interrupt the sounds from
	Explorapedia. Some sound-producing applications may take over the
	audio capability and prevent other Windows applications from being
	able to make sounds. If you suspect you have such an application, do
	not run it at the same time as Explorapedia.
	
	ERROR MESSAGE: "NO WAVE DEVICE THAT CAN PLAY FILES . . "
	If you get the error message, "No wave device that can play files in
	the current format is installed. Use the drivers option to install
	the wave device" when trying to play some sound clips or dialogues,
	the Microsoft audio-compression manager and drivers may not be
	installed correctly. Run the Explorapedia setup program from the CD-
	ROM to correct the problem.
	
	7. CD-ROM Drive Problems
	
	COMMON SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS WITH CD-ROM DRIVES
	NOTE: Do not remove the Explorapedia compact disc from your CD-ROM
	drive while running Explorapedia.
	
	Explorapedia requires a double-speed CD-ROM drive.
	
	If Explorapedia cannot find the data files it needs to run, you will
	see an error message prompting you to correct the problem. To find
	the source of the problem, do the following:
	
	* Make sure the Explorapedia compact disc is correctly inserted into
	 the CD-ROM drive.
	
	* Make sure that the drive is connected to your computer correctly and
	 it is functioning in MS-DOS. If you have an external CD-ROM drive,
	 make sure the power is turned on. You can test the function in MS-
	 DOS by viewing a directory of the drive at an MS-DOS prompt. To do
	 this, change to the CD-ROM drive at an MS-DOS prompt, type dir, and
	 then press ENTER.
	
	* Make sure that Explorapedia is looking for the compact disc on the
	 correct drive. Check that the EXPLORA.INI file is in the Windows
	 directory.
	
	If you still see an error message, try running the setup program
	from the Explorapedia CD-ROM again.
	
	8. Running Explorapedia on Windows NT
	
	Explorapedia may need to copy some files to your system directory.
	In order for Setup to do this, you must be a member of the
	Administrator group when you log on. Otherwise, Setup will not be
	able to copy these files to your drive. You can check your user
	status with the User Manager.
	
	Explorapedia does not support Windows NT version 3.1 or 3.5. You
	must have Windows NT version 3.51 or later in order to run
	Explorapedia.
	
	Non-Intel Windows NT machines (i.e., Mips or Alpha processor) are
	not supported.
	
	9. Mouse/Cursor Function
	
	If you find that the mouse cursor jumps around on the screen when
	you perform certain actions in Explorapedia, and you are using
	Microsoft Intellipoint mouse software, you need to turn off the
	"snap-to" option. Open Control Panel (found in the Main group in
	Program Manager, or on the Start menu under Settings in Windows 95),
	and choose the Mouse option. Turn off the "snap-to" option in the
	Mouse Manager dialog box, and close Mouse Manager and Control Panel.
	
	10. Administering User Names (Login Administrator)
	
	Explorapedia includes a simple utility, Login Administrator
	(LOGINADM.EXE), for adding, deleting, and renaming user names
	listed in the initial Explorapedia login screen. If an imaginative
	child enters a rude or incorrect user name, or if you just want to
	add or remove user names from the list, you can use the utility.
	
	Login Administrator is located on the Explorapedia disc. For
	information on using Login Administrator, use Write or WordPad to
	open the LOGINADM.WRI document located in the \LoginAdm directory
	on the Explorapedia disc.
	
	11. Removing Explorapedia
	
	Setup for the Windows 95/Windows NT version of Explorapedia can
	completely remove the product from your system.
	
	On Windows 95, you can use the Add/Remove Programs application in
	Control Panel to remove Explorapedia and all its related files.
	You need your Explorapedia disc.
	
	  To remove Explorapedia (Windows 95):
	
	    1. Insert the disc in the CD-ROM drive.
	
	    2. From the Start Menu, choose Settings.
	
	    3. Choose Control Panel.
	
	    4. Double-click Add/Remove Programs.
	
	    5. Double-click the Explorapedia entry on the dialog box.
	       Explorapedia Setup starts up.
	
	    6. From the first Setup screen, click Remove.
	
	If you have changed the drive letter mapping of your CD drive,
	perhaps by adding a second hard disk to your system (for example,
	changed the CD-ROM from drive D: to drive E:), you may have trouble
	running Setup from Control Panel. If you run into problems, use the
	following procedure instead.
	
	  To remove Explorapedia (Windows NT):
	
	    1. Insert the disc in the CD-ROM drive.
	
	    2. Run the Setup.Exe application on the Explorapedia disc.
	
	    3. From the first Setup screen, click Remove.
	
	12. Credit Information
