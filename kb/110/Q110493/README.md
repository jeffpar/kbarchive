	Section   Description
	-------   -------------------------------------------------------
	  1      RUNNING IN LOW MEMORY OR RUNNING SLOWLY
	
	  2      CD-ROM PROBLEMS
	
	  3      VIDEO DISPLAY PROBLEMS
	
	  4      AUDIO PROBLEMS
	
	  5      MEDIAVISION CDPC PROBLEMS
	
	=================================================================
	1.  RUNNING IN LOW MEMORY OR RUNNING SLOWLY
	=================================================================
	
	Schubert uses your computer's system memory to display
	pictures.  If you find that Schubert runs slowly or if
	you encounter out-of-memory errors, Schubert probably
	doesn't have enough memory.  Consider doing the following to
	improve your computer's performance:
	
	* Close all unnecessary applications.
	
	* Determine how much memory your computer has available by
	  typing "mem" and pressing ENTER at the DOS prompt.  You need
	  a minimum of 4MB (4,194,304 bytes) of total memory to use
	  Schubert.  If you do not have at least 4MB of
	  memory, you may not be able to run Schubert until
	  you add more memory.
	
	* If you are running Windows in Enhanced mode, set up a
	  permanent Windows swap file on your hard disk.  See your
	  Windows documentation for more information.
	
	* Defragment ("clean up") your hard disk by running a
	  defragmentation program.
	
	=================================================================
	2.  CD-ROM PROBLEMS
	=================================================================
	
	NOTE - Do not remove the Schubert compact disc from
	your CD-ROM drive while Schubert is in the process of
	playing music or displaying a new picture.
	
	In order to run properly, Schubert requires an
	MPC-compatible CD-ROM drive. An MPC-compatible drive
	"has an average seek time of less than one second and
	can transfer data from the compact disc at 150K per
	second while using less than 40% of the CPU bandwidth."
	If you are having problems, check the documentation that
	came with your CD-ROM drive to make sure it meets these
	requirements.  An incompatible CD-ROM drive will slow down
	the performance of Schubert.
	
	If the Schubert program cannot find the data files
	that it needs from the Schubert compact disc, you'll
	see a message that tells you that the correct CD must be
	in the drive to continue.  To find the source of the problem,
	do the following:
	
	* Make sure the Schubert compact disc is correctly
	  inserted into the CD-ROM drive.
	
	* Make sure the CD Audio driver is correctly installed.
	  See AUDIO PROBLEMS section below.
	
	* If you have an external CD-ROM drive, make sure the
	  drive is connected to your computer, plugged in, and turned
	  on.  If you still see the error message after checking the
	  points above, check the documentation that came with your
	  CD-ROM drive or contact the company that supplied the drive.
	
	=================================================================
	3.  VIDEO DISPLAY PROBLEMS
	=================================================================
	
	Schubert will run in 16-color or 256-color screen
	mode.  The program will automatically detect whether you are
	running in 16 or 256-color and display pictures accordingly.  If
	your computer is running in 16-color mode, and the video card
	will support 256 colors in 640x480 resolution, you can run
	Windows Setup to change the screen driver to see Schubert
	at its highest image quality.
	
	Some screen drivers which are capable of 256 colors appear to
	the Schubert program as if they are in 256 color mode even when
	they are running in 16 color mode.  When running with these
	drivers in 16 color mode, the product will look very strange,
	because the colors will be wrong.  To solve the problem, run
	Windows Setup to change to 256 color mode.
	
	------------
	ATI PROBLEMS
	------------
	Multimedia Schubert is incompatible with some advanced features
	used by some video cards such as the Mach32 chip set running the
	ATI drivers.
	
	For Schubert to run on the ATI driver the "256 color palette"
	control in the "Advanced features" of the "ATI Control Panel"
	needs to be set to ON.  See your video card documentation for
	more information.
	
	--------------------
	HAND CURSOR PROBLEMS
	--------------------
	Whenever the mouse arrow is placed on top of clickable text (i.e.,
	glossary words and the text in 'Pocket Audio Guide') the cursor
	should turn into a hand to show that the text is clickable.  However,
	some display drivers will cause this cursor to display incorrectly.
	This may look very strange, but the cursor will still work exactly
	as it should.
	
	=================================================================
	4.  AUDIO PROBLEMS
	=================================================================
	
	All of the music in Multimedia Schubert plays directly
	from the CD.  In order for it to play properly on your machine, you
	must have the correct driver installed.  If the correct driver is
	not installed, you will get the following message:
	"Failed to open CD-Audio device driver.  Please check that CD-Audio
	is installed." To fix the problem, install the CD-Audio device
	driver by following these steps:
	
	1. Open the Control Panel from the Program Manager.
	2. Double-click the Drivers icon, or choose Drivers from the
	  Settings menu.
	3. Choose Add...
	4. Choose CD Audio from the list box.
	5. Choose OK.
	
	If CD-Audio is installed and you are still not able to hear the
	music, but you can hear the voice audio, such as the glossary
	pronunciations and "A Word from the Author," it is possible that
	your CD-ROM is not properly connected to your sound card.  Your
	CD-ROM owner's manual should show you how to check that your
	CD-ROM is properly connected.
	
	-------------------------
	SOUND DOESN'T PLAY AT ALL
	-------------------------
	
	If you don't hear any sounds, make sure that the volume for your
	speakers is set to an audible level.
	
	If the volume is set to an audible level and you still hear no
	sounds at all, something may be wrong with your sound board
	setup.  Check to see that the driver is installed correctly and,
	if necessary, reinstall it.  Refer to the documentation that came
	with your sound card for more information on installing audio
	drivers.
	
	Please note that Schubert requires an MPC-compatible
	sound board to be installed and is not intended to run with
	drivers which use the PC internal speaker, such as the
	unsupported "PC Speaker" driver.  Such a driver will in most
	cases not play any sounds, and if the driver setup option
	"Enable Interrupts" is not checked, your system may crash.
	If you have both a sound board and the PC Speaker driver
	installed, it is preferable to un-install the PC Speaker driver.
	
	------------------
	MEDIA VISION CARDS
	------------------
	
	A small number of Media Vision sound card drivers (Pro Audio
	Spectrum cards) may not play glossary pronunciations or "A Word
	from the Author" properly.  If you have a Media Vision
	card and don't hear glossary pronunciations or "A Word from
	the Author," but you do hear music, you may need to upgrade
	your driver.  Contact Media Vision Technical Support to find out
	how to obtain a new driver.
	
	------------------
	SOUND CARD PROBLEM
	------------------
	A driver which comes with the new Pro Audio Vision Sound card,
	version 1.46f, causes problems in Multimedia Schubert.  This
	driver does not keep track of the time elapsed when it is playing
	CD Audio, which causes the pages not to turn correctly in the Close
	Reading and Die Forelle chapters.  Version 1.46 of this driver does
	not have this problem, so switching to this driver will allow Schubert
	to work properly.
	
	=================================================================
	5. MEDIAVISION CDPC PROBLEMS
	=================================================================
	If you are running Multimedia Schubert using Mediavision CDPC hardware, you
	may encounter errors when you successfully make a match in 'The Trout
	Game'.
	Because these errors specifically involve the CDPC hardware, you should
	check to make sure the hardware is correctly installed.  However, it is
	still
	possible that you will encounter errors when matches are made.  Please note
	that this is only a problem in 'The Trout Game' and will not affect any of
	the
	other chapters in Multimedia Schubert.
