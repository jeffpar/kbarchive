	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article contains a correction for a documentation error in Microsoft Golf
	2001 Edition online Help.
	
	In the Help file, the Troubleshooting and Technical Support section states:
	
	  Solution 5: Update Windows. Over time, Windows suffers file conflicts and
	  corruption. Microsoft also periodically releases updates for Windows. Keeping
	  Windows updated eliminates many problems. To check which version of Windows
	  you have:
	
	  1. Right-click My Computer.
	
	  2. Click Properties.
	
	  3. Look under System for the operating system name (Windows 95, Windows 98, or
	  Windows NT).
	
	  4. Look for a number under the operating system name.
	
	  If the number says 4.00.950, you need to install Windows 95 Service Pack 1 and
	  the Kernel32 Update. The name of the Windows 95 Service Pack 1 file is
	  95sp1.exe and the name of Kernel32 Update is k32.exe. These files are found
	  in the ATS folder on the Microsoft Golf 2001 CD 1.
	
	  If the number is 4.00.950a, 4.00.95b, or 4.10.1998, no updates are needed.
	
	The 95Sp1.exe and K32.exe files are not located in the ATS folder on the
	Microsoft Golf 2001 CD 1 CD-ROM.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To update the K32.exe file that is mentioned in the Help file, download the
	Krnlupd.exe file from the Microsoft Download Center.
	
	The following file is available for download from the Microsoft Download Center:
	
	  Krnlupd.exe (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/release.asp?ReleaseID=12645)
	
	Release Date: Oct-14-1999
