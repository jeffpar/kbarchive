	Known Video Issues
	------------------
	
	   - Although Train Simulator may work correctly with large or custom fonts,
	  depending on monitor, desktop size, and screen resolution, it is recommended
	  that you set your system's display settings to Small Fonts to maximize
	  viewable space in Train Simulator dialog boxes.
	
	- If you have a computer with 64 megabytes (MB) of RAM or less, and are using
	  video cards with 16 MB or less, do not set the "World Objects Texture
	  Quality" setting (in the Options dialog box) to greater than 2, or the game
	  may stop responding (hang).
	
	- The following resolutions are supported by most video cards and are available
	  for selection (if supported): 640x480, 800x600, 1024x768, 1280x1024.
	
	- All resolutions provided by the video card at 640x480 resolution and greater
	  are supported, in 16- and 32-bit color depths.
	
	- Resolutions of 640x480 and less, or color depths other than 16- or 32-bit,
	  are not supported.
	
	- When you try to launch the game, you may receive the following error
	  message:
	
	  Unknown is causing an error in unknown. Unknown will now shut down.
