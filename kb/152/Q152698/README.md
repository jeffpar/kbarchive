	A lot of people will tell you about Paul Bunyan like they know the straight
	story. But they don't know an ax handle from an ox yoke in my book.
	
	Paul flat-out invented loggin', and by the time he got done, the United States
	was fit for livin'.
	
	PAGE 2
	
	Listen up, and I'll tell you about Paul Bunyan, the greatest loggin' man there
	ever was.
	
	Now, first time I saw Paul Bunyan was the Winter of the Blue Snow.
	
	Me and the boys were sittin' in our cabin, huddled around the pot-belly stove.
	
	PAGE 3
	
	Outside, the snow was fallin' fast, furious, and blue. That's right.
	
	It's a fact, the snow came outta the sky as blue as a Robin's egg.
	
	That's why they called it the Winter of the Blue Snow.
	
	PAGE 4
	
	Pancakes was our dinner for the three-hundred-and tenth night in a row.
	
	We was concentrating on talkin' and chewin' with our mouths closed, when it
	started thunderin' outside.
	
	Then I seen him. He was carryin' the biggest, mightiest, dang-darndest ax I ever
	seen.
	
	PAGE 5
	
	We all ran outside to get a better look at what was coming our way. And there he
	stood, large as a mountain.
	
	"Sorry to intrude, boys," he said, real friendly like. "Name's Paul Bunyan."
	
	PAGE 6
	
	"What do you fellas got cookin'? I've been eatin' beans all winter long, and when
	I got a whiff of your vittles, I had to stop by."
	
	Well, now, we happened to have the greatest cook this side of Kalamazoo: Hot
	Biscuit Sally.
	
	PAGE 7
	
	And her pancakes were such good eatin' that we had 'em mornin', noon, and night.
	
	So Sal made up a king-sized batch of pancakes for our guest, and in no time at
	all he was eatin' and talkin'.
	
	PAGE 8
	
	"I'm clearin' the timber off of Sulfur Mountain," Paul explained.
	
	Me and the boys knowed that Sulfur Mountain was so steep that a person trying to
	walk up it would fall over backwards.
	
	PAGE 9
	
	"You mean you're clearin' off Sulfur Mountain by yourself?" I says.
	
	"Yup," says Paul.
	
	The boys didn't know what to think. Either this lad had beans in his head, or he
	knowed a few things about loggin' that we didn't.
	
	PAGE 10
	
	Brimstone Bill was gettin' a little hot under the collar.
	
	Brimstone could cuss a blue streak, and he got especially perturbed when he
	thought a body was braggin'.
	
	PAGE 11
	
	"How in tarnation do you expect us to believe that you is clearin' that land by
	your lonesome," he snarled.
	
	"I always work alone," said Paul.
	
	PAGE 12
	
	"Dad-blame-it!" cried Brimstone. "Then show us how you does it, 'cause I think
	you're full of soup!"
	
	Paul got up, hefted his ax, and walked into the woods.
	
	PAGE 13
	
	"Alrighty, boys, stand clear."
	
	Paul spat into his hands and choked the end of his ax handle. He wound up and
	swung. He felled twenty three trees with that first swing.
	
	PAGE 14
	
	Any one of those trees would have taken you or me at least six hours of
	choppin'.
	
	Then he got his rhythm, and he started swingin' like a tornado goin' through a
	toothpick factory.
	
	PAGE 15
	
	Paul cleared forty acres during his little demonstration, and when the dust
	settled, any trees that were left standin' took one look around and laid down in
	fright.
	
	"Well, that's how I do it," says Paul. He wasn't braggin', either.
	
	PAGE 16
	
	That boy was just the biggest, bestest, toughest, strongest, ding-dandiest logger
	there ever was.
	
	And that's how we all come to join up with Paul during the Winter of the Blue
	Snow.
	
	PAGE 17
	
	One fine winter's day, while Paul was out scoutin' the countryside, he came
	across a baby ox, buried in the blue snow.
	
	That calf had been in the snow so long that his hide was dyed solid blue.
	
	PAGE 18
	
	Paul blew three warm breaths into the calf, and that critter opened his eyes like
	he'd just been born.
	
	Well, sir, when he looked up with them big blue eyes, somethin' inside of Paul
	began to melt.
	
	PAGE 19
	
	"Now there's nothin' to worry about -- I'm takin' care of you, babe, and I always
	will."
	
	That's what everybody called the calf from then on: Babe.
	
	PAGE 20
	
	From the git-go, Babe ate a ton of grain a day, and was always lookin' for more.
	The fellers noticed that if they watched Babe for five minutes, they could see
	him grow right before their eyes.
	
	PAGE 21
	
	By the time Babe stopped growin', the distance between the tips of his horns
	measured one-hundred forty-two ax handles,
	
	four bottles of sassafras soda, a plug of chewin' tobacco, and a hard-boiled
	egg.
	
	PAGE 22
	
	We was cuttin' through the woods like nobody's business, when one day Paul got a
	letter from Teddy Roosevelt, the President of the United States.
	
	Seems Mr. Roosevelt was in a fix, and he needed a hand.
	
	This is how the letter read:
	
	PAGE 23
	
	  The White House
	  Washington, D.C.
	
	  Greetings, Paul Bunyan,
	
	  I wish to congratulate you on the bully job you
	  and your crew have done clearing the great
	  states of Wisconsin and Minnesota. We just
	  don't have enough room in this country for all
	  our people to live. I understand the Dakota
	  Territory would make a perfect place for
	  settlers' homes. Unfortunately, the entire
	  place is covered with trees.
	
	  With the power vested in me by the American
	  people, I hereby order you to clear the Dakotas
	  by next spring.
	
	  Thank you in advance for your help, and bully
	  for you.
	
	  Yours truly,
	  Teddy Roosevelt
	  The President
	
	PAGE 24
	
	"Well, if that ain't a kick in the britches," Paul said to the boys.
	
	And with that, Paul dashed off a letter to Teddy Roosevelt:
	
	  The Woods
	  Somewhere near Minnesota
	
	  Dear Mr. President,
	
	  Consider the job DONE. I'll take care of
	  clearing The Dakotas, presently, forthwithly,
	  hence.
	
	  Sincerely,
	  Paul Bunyan
	  Logger
	
	PAGE 25
	
	In those days, the Dakotas were one gigantic forest, so thick with trees you had
	to pry your way in.
	
	There wasn't a lick of open land in the entire territory. The trees were tall and
	fat, and the wood was so hard you'd dull your ax with just a single swing.
	
	PAGE 26
	
	It didn't take long for word to get around that Paul was doing some serious work
	out there.
	
	Loggers started comin' out of the woodwork to work those woods with Paul's crew.
	
	PAGE 27
	
	Johnny Inkslinger was the accountant for Paul's loggin' enterprise, and even he
	couldn't count all the men.
	
	The loggers slept in bunk beds with ten decks.
	
	PAGE 28
	
	So Johnny tried countin' the bunks and multiplyin' by ten to figure the number of
	men employed.
	
	He gave up countin' at ten thousand, six hundred and twenty-three. That's a lot
	of men!
	
	PAGE 29
	
	Poor Hot Biscuit Sally was makin' pancakes six ways to Christmas, tryin' to keep
	everybody fed.
	
	"Paul," she said, "I've burned out three griddles this mornin' alone, and some of
	our boys still don't have their breakfast. Now what are we gonna do about it?"
	
	PAGE 30
	
	"Sounds like we need a bigger griddle," Paul replied.
	
	So Paul had Ole Jolson, the blacksmith, melt down fifty-three dozen steel plows,
	and forge a griddle that was an acre-and-a-half across ... well, close to that.
	
	PAGE 31
	
	Paul and Babe hauled it back to camp. When the two of 'em got back to the peak of
	Thunder Mountain, Paul decided to ride the griddle the rest of the way.
	
	"Look out below," he yelled. With that, he took off, ridin' the griddle, and
	givin' out a whoop and holler that darn near made the needles on the pine trees
	thread themselves.
	
	PAGE 32
	
	He roared down that mountain, slicin' through the trees, and tore into camp and
	it wasn't long before Hot Biscuit Sal was makin' her first batch of pancakes on
	her new griddle.
	
	PAGE 33
	
	President Teddy Roosevelt wanted the Dakotas cleared by spring. Word was out that
	settlers was already headin' out there, ready to move in.
	
	We was loggin' faster than a hog eats supper, but come February, we wasn't even
	halfway through.
	
	PAGE 34
	
	There was no way our crew was goin' to complete the job by spring. We were
	gettin' desperate.
	
	Paul and his loggers were slowed to a standstill by the huge pile of cut trees.
	
	PAGE 35
	
	We were havin' a darn-awful time haulin' the timber out of there, 'cause the road
	was so crooked.
	
	The road not only had S-turns and Z-turns, and U turns, it had turns shaped like
	every letter in the dad-blame alphabet, including a few that ain't even been
	invented yet.
	
	PAGE 36
	
	Paul had to do somethin' about that road. So he sat and gave it some thought.
	
	Suddenly, Paul leaped up and cried out, "Sufferin' sequoias! I got it!" And this
	was his idea.
	
	PAGE 37
	
	He hooked up Babe to the far end of the road, and gave the blue ox the word to
	pull. It was that simple.
	
	Babe started gruntin', and snortin', and pawin', and pullin', and, wouldn't you
	know it, the road started to move out.
	
	PAGE 38
	
	That little bit of give in the road was all Babe needed to feel.
	
	He just started marchin' in a straight line, draggin' that road behind him,
	straightenin' it as true as a crow flies.
	
	Once Babe straightened out the road, Paul Bunyan and his men worked day and night
	to keep on schedule. There were no breaks for chow, and no sleepin'.
	
	PAGE 39
	
	When the rooster crowed at the break of dawn on the first day of spring, Paul
	felled the last tree in the Dakotas.
	
	He had kept his bargain with Teddy Roosevelt.
	
	PAGE 40
	
	Paul let loose a victory holler that blew down all the scrub pines that his men
	hadn't bothered to chop.
	
	He was so full of beans 'cause he'd finished clearin' the Dakotas, he ran up to
	the top off Mount Rushmore.
	
	PAGE 41
	
	He carved Teddy Roosevelt's face out of granite with his ax, and then he added
	the faces of three other presidents: Washington, Jefferson, and Lincoln.
	
	It was Paul's way of personalizing the job for old Teddy, and, now that the trees
	was gone, it gave folks somethin' to look at.
	
	PAGE 42
	
	On the horizon, Paul Bunyan saw a wagon train, bringin' settlers to their new
	homes where the forest once had been.
	
	Paul surveyed the miles of naked plains all around him. You'd have thought he'd
	have been happy, finishin' off the biggest loggin' job there ever was.
	
	PAGE 43
	
	But Paul grew downright sad thinkin' how carried away he got, clearin' the Dakota
	forest.
	
	"Why these settlers will never hear the wind rustlin' through the leaves," Paul
	said to no one in particular.
	
	PAGE 44
	
	"They'll never ... they'll never get to sit under the shade of an elm tree on an
	August afternoon."
	
	Paul and Babe headed north that day. Just picked up and went.
	
	PAGE 45
	
	Now, Paul Bunyan ain't dead or nothin', y'understand? Shoot! That boy's like a
	redwood -- he just gets bigger and stronger every year.
	
	I know, 'cause I seen him with my own eyes a winter or two ago.
	
	PAGE 46
	
	Paul's done loggin', I'll tell ya that. Paul's plantin' trees now, instead of
	choppin' them down.
	
	"I chopped a billion-trillion trees," Paul told me. "Now I'm fixin' to plant a
	billion-trillion."
	
	PAGE 47
	
	And if I know him, that's exactly what he'll do, too.
	
	What's that you say? You want to help? Where can you find Paul Bunyan? Well,
	that's an easy one. He ain't hard to find.
	
	PAGE 48
	
	Go on out there to where the woods is the deepest, and the trees the thickest,
	
	where the wind sings through the leaves, and the air is rich with the smell of
	pine: the heart of the forest. That's where Paul is, that's where he was, and
	doggonit, that's where he'll always be.
