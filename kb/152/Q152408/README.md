	Welcome to Scholastic's Magic School Bus series: Explores in the Age of
	Dinosaurs. In this Magic School Bus adventure, you'll travel to seven different
	locations in three different prehistoric time periods. Your objective is to help
	the Friz replace three missing photographs from her photo album. You must find
	the dinosaurs that were in the missing pictures and photograph them so that the
	Friz will have them in her photo album again. You'll get clues that will help
	lead you to the proper time and place so that you can photograph the missing
	dinosaurs.

	the bus and click the photo album. Once you open the photo album, you can click
	the page that is missing the photograph and get clues that will help you locate
	the correct dinosaur. After you have traveled to the correct location and have
	taken a picture of the dinosaur, the photograph will show up in the photo album.
	You can turn the page and find clues as to the location of the next missing
	dinosaur. You must find all three dinosaurs and take their pictures in order to
	complete the game successfully.
	
	Each different prehistoric location has games, activities, animations, and
	interesting information about the different time periods. Don't forget to
	explore the back of the bus to play games and gather information about the age
	of dinosaurs.
