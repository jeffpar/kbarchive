	--------------------------------------------------------
	1. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS FOR RUNNING MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS
	--------------------------------------------------------
	
	To install and run Musical Instruments you need:
	
	- a Macintosh computer with a Macintosh-compatible color monitor
	- System 6.0.7 or later
	- 4 MB of memory
	- at least 1 MB of available hard disk space
	- a CD-ROM drive
	
	You can run Musical Instruments directly from the compact disc. To play
	the sounds, certain files must be in your system (QuickTime is the most
	important). You can drag these from the System Files folder on the CD
	into your System Folder. If Musical Instruments can't find these files,
	it will prompt you to run the Installer.
	
	The Installer will add any necessary files to your System Folder. It
	will also copy the Musical Instruments program files to a folder on
	your hard disk; this makes the program load a little faster when you
	start it. The sounds and pictures remain on the CD, so you still need
	to insert the CD to play Musical Instruments.
	
	----------------------------------------
	2. SCREEN SIZES AND COLOR CONFIGURATION
	----------------------------------------
	
	On startup, Musical Instruments checks your monitor and displays the
	images as best it can on your Macintosh. If your setup can be adjusted
	to make Musical Instruments run better, the program will prompt you to do
	so.
	
	Musical Instruments will run on a 12" or 13" monitor, as found on a
	Macintosh LC or Performa; the program will also run on all larger
	monitors. Musical Instruments looks best in 256 colors (8-bit mode),
	although it can run in 16 colors. If your monitor is set to 16 colors
	or less, but is capable of  running in 256 colors, Musical Instruments
	will offer to change the monitor setup for you (this is the equivalent
	of using the Monitors control panel) to get the highest-quality images.
	Using more than 256 colors (16-bit or 24-bit mode) will not improve the
	images and will slightly slow down display. If you are using one of
	these modes, Musical Instruments will prompt you to switch to 256
	colors. Running Musical Instruments in another mode will cause no
	damage, but will not provide the best performance.
	
	Musical Instruments is not designed to run in black and white.
	
	------------------
	3. SOUND PROBLEMS
	------------------
	
	If you do not hear any sound at all, make sure that you have QuickTime
	in your System Folder or run the Installer from the Musical Instruments
	CD. After adding system files, you may need to choose Restart from the
	Special menu to make them active.
	
	Sound may be inaudible if the sound level is turned down. To set the
	sound level, use the Sound control panel, and experiment with the
	speaker volume setting until you get a comfortable sound level. If you
	set the sound level to maximum, you may get sound distortion just as
	you would on a stereo system.
	
	If your Macintosh is running in Virtual Memory mode, you may find that
	sounds are interrupted: when Virtual Memory is turned on, sounds are
	sometimes placed on the hard disk rather than into real RAM. For best
	performance, turn off Virtual Memory. To do this in System 7, bring up
	the Memory control panel, choose the Virtual Memory Off option, and
	then restart the computer.
	
	Macintosh computers have built-in speakers. The speakers vary in
	quality and loudness depending on which Macintosh you have. The quality
	has improved in later models, so a Quadra will give you better sound
	quality than an early Mac II.
	
	If you have a sound card installed in your Macintosh, you will get
	high-quality sound. Musical Instruments sounds are recorded in 16-bit
	audio, and playback quality is adjusted to your Macintosh capability.
	
	-------------------------------------------
	4. RUNNING IN LOW MEMORY OR RUNNING SLOWLY
	-------------------------------------------
	
	Musical Instruments needs to use a reasonably large amount of your
	computer's system memory (RAM) to display pictures and play sounds. It
	should run on any Macintosh with 4 MB of memory.
	
	If Musical Instruments runs slowly or displays out-of-memory messages,
	it probably does not have enough memory. Here are some things you can
	do to help:
	
	Run only one application at a time. If other applications are running,
	close them, then start Musical Instruments again.
	
	Do not run in 24-bit display mode; allow Musical Instruments to change
	the mode.
	
	Reduce the amount of memory being used by your system software. In the
	Finder, choose About this Macintosh from the Apple menu to see how much
	memory your computer has and how much is being used by the system. If,
	for example, the dialog box displays "Total memory  4,096K" and the
	line underneath displays "System Software   3,500K," this indicates
	that you have 4 megabytes of RAM, but the Macintosh is using 3.5 of
	those for its operating system. In this case, a number of applications
	will have problems running. Any applications that are running will also
	be listed in this box.
	
	You may be able to reduce the amount of memory used by the system. The
	process for doing this will differ depending on whether you are running
	a version of System 7 or System 6. In either case, you may have many
	fonts or DAs (Apple menu items) installed, and could remove those you
	are not using. For instructions on removing fonts or DAs, refer to your
	Macintosh documentation. Desktop goodies such as screen savers and desk
	pictures also occupy RAM. Under System 7, you may have system
	extensions you do not need, such as printer drivers for printers you
	don't have. If you remove items like these to free memory, make sure to
	keep copies somewhere on your hard disk or on a backup disk so that you
	can re-install them if you need them later.
	
	Musical Instruments is pre-set to its preferred memory size. You can
	change the amount of memory the program uses by choosing Get Info from
	the File menu in the Finder, and then changing the memory allocation.
	If your computer has spare RAM, you can set Musical Instruments to use
	more memory, which will improve performance by keeping more of the
	sounds in memory.  If you have trouble with running out of memory, you
	can set Musical Instruments to use less memory.  Be warned that a low
	memory setting may cause the program to perform poorly. For example, it
	will not play sounds or display pop-up windows if it runs out of
	memory. If you allocate Musical Instruments less than 1.5 MB, problems
	are likely to result.
	
	-----------------------
	5. PRINTING AND COPYING
	-----------------------
	
	The screens in Musical Instruments are stored and displayed as large
	color pictures, which are optimized for best screen reproduction rather
	than for print reproduction. You can, however, print screen images,
	which will be of the same quality as a screen shot made with a
	screen-capture function.
	
	If you have only a black-and-white printer, Musical Instruments will
	not print very well. Musical Instruments can print better grayscale
	images--if you have  a laser printer, choose the Color/grayscale option
	for better quality. You can also print in color if you have a color
	printer. Depending on the type of printer you have, printing a picture
	may take several minutes. Because the pictures can be quite large, you
	may have difficulty copying or printing in low-memory conditions.  In
	this case, close all other applications and then try again.
	
	The Print and Copy commands affect only the active window.
	
	----------------------
	6. DEMONSTRATION MODE
	----------------------
	
	Musical Instruments has a demonstration mode that begins an automatic
	random "slide show" when the computer has been idle for a certain period.
	
	To activate demonstration mode, hold down the Shift key while you click
	the Random button. This displays a dialog box. Check the "Start random
	automatically" box and specify the number of idle minutes that must
	elapse before starting the slide show, then click OK.
	
	To stop the slide show and use Musical Instruments at any time, move
	the mouse or press a key.
	
	Demonstration mode will remain active until you turn it off: to do
	this, hold down Shift again and click the Random button, clear the
	"Start random automatically" box in the dialog box, and then click OK.
