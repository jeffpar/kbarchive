	Converting Ami Pro 3.x to and from Word
	---------------------------------------
	
	Ami Pro 3.1 for Windows does include a Word 6.0 for Windows converter that can be
	used to open and save Word 6.0 documents. However, Ami Pro versions 3.0 and 3.01
	do not.
	
	Ami Pro versions 3.0, 3.01, and 3.1 for Windows, Ami Pro 3.0 for OS/2, and Ami
	Pro 3.0 for UNIX support the import and export of the following formats:
	
	  Word for Windows 2.0
	  Word for MS-DOS 5.x
	  Rich Text Format (RTF)
	
	Each of these formats can be written and read by the Word products on the Windows
	and Macintosh platforms mentioned at the beginning of this article.
	
	To save an Ami Pro 3.0 or 3.01 file as one of these formats, follow these steps:
	
	1. On the File menu, click Save As.
	
	2. In the List Files Of Type list, select Microsoft Word, Word for Windows 2.0,
	  or Rich Text Format.
	
	  NOTE: Word for Windows 2.0 is the most appropriate format option for
	  conversion to Word 2.x or 6.0 for Windows.
	
	3. Enter a path and file name, and then click OK.
	
	To open a Word document in Ami Pro 3.x, follow these steps:
	
	1. Save your Word document as Word for Windows 2.0, Word for MS-DOS 5.x, or RTF
	  format.
	
	  NOTE: Word for Windows 2.0 is the most appropriate format option for
	  conversion from Word 2.x or 6.0 for Windows. However, Ami Pro may fail to
	  recognize a document that has been saved from Word 6.x or 7.0 in Word 2.0
	  format. If so, use Word for MS-DOS or RTF format as an alternative interim
	  format.
	
	2. In Ami Pro, click Open on the File menu.
	
	3. In the File Type list, click Microsoft Word, Word for Windows, or Rich Text
	  Format.
	
	4. Specify the path and name of the file that you want to convert, and then
	  click OK.
	
	Ami Pro 2.x to and from Word
	----------------------------
	
	Ami Pro versions 2.x for Windows support import and export of Word 1.0 for
	Windows, Word for MS-DOS 5.x, and Rich Text Format (RTF) formats.
	
	NOTE: Word 97 does not support export to Word for Windows 1.0 format. If you are
	using Word 97, you should use either Word for MS-DOS 5.x or RTF format as an
	alternative.
	
	Saving an Ami Pro 2.x File in Another Format:
	
	To save an Ami Pro 2.x file as one of these formats, follow these steps:
	
	1. On the Ami Pro File menu, click Save As.
	
	2. In the File Type list, click Microsoft Word or Rich Text Format.
	
	3. Enter a path and file name, and then click OK.
	
	Opening a Word File into Ami Pro 2.x:
	
	To open a Word file into Ami Pro 2.x, follow these steps:
	
	1. Save your Word document as Word for Windows 1.0, Word for MS-DOS 5.x, or RTF
	  format.
	
	  NOTE: Word 97 does not support export to Word for Windows 1.0 format. If you
	  are using Word 97, you should use either Word for MS-DOS 5.x or RTF format as
	  an alternative.
	
	2. In Ami Pro, click Open on the File menu.
	
	3. In the File Type list, click Microsoft Word, Word for Windows, or Rich Text
	  Format.
	
	4. Specify the path and name of the file that you want to convert, and then
	  click OK.
	
	Third-party Conversion Solutions
	--------------------------------
	
	A number of conversion products and conversion bureaus support conversion between
	Ami Pro formats, Word formats, and other formats that Word can both read and
	write. For more information about theses options, please see the following
	article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
	
	  Q174813 WD: Third-Party Conversion Solutions
	
	- In the File Type or List Files of Type list in each version of Ami Pro, the
	  "Microsoft Word" option stands for Word for MS-DOS file format, not Word for
	  Windows format.
	
	- If the file type you want (for example, Word for Windows 2.0) doesn't appear
	  on the list, that converter is not installed. If you do not have the
	  appropriate converter or if you need help installing it, call Lotus Word
	  Processing Division technical support at (404) 399-5505.
	
	- You must select the appropriate file format from the Ami Pro 2.x File Type or
	  Ami Pro 3.x Select File Of Type list before specifying the file name of a
	  document you want to import. If you do not, Ami Pro will assume you want to
	  open a native Ami Pro .SAM document and will return an error message and fail
	  to convert your Word or RTF document.
	
	- According to Lotus technical support, an update of the Word for Windows 2.0
	  converter that also ships with Ami Pro version 3.1 is now available for all
	  Ami Pro 3.x users in the Lotus forum on CompuServe. To access the converter
	  and associated readme file providing update notes and installation
	  instructions:
	
	  1. At the CompuServe ! prompt, type GO LOTUS.
	
	  2. Download files Filt31.exe and Ap9608.txt from Ami Pro Technotes Library
	     #3.
	
	  The updated Word for Windows 2.0 converter Wword20.flt available in Filt31.exe
	  now provides support for "Quick Import." Quick Import allows you to type in
	  the name of a document without specifying the file type as stated in the note
	  above. Ami Pro auto-detects the filter needed. Additional information on
	  Quick Import is provided in the Ami Pro 3.x user's guide on pages 360 and
	  361.
	
	- Ami Pro may import or export one format more accurately than another. You may
	  want to experiment with the various interchange formats referenced above to
	  determine which format provides the best conversion fidelity for the document
	  formatting elements most important to you.
	
	According to the Ami Pro 3.0 user's guide, the following are limitations of the
	Word for Windows 2.0, Word for MS-DOS, and RTF Import and Export Filters. These
	limitations may change as Lotus updates these converters.
