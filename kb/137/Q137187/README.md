	WHERE TO FIND HELP
	===================
	
	For detailed information on usage, please see the online Help in
	Bookshelf '95. The Troubleshooting section in Help covers a variety of
	topics such as improving performance and resolving audio difficulties.
	
	REMOVING BOOKSHELF '94
	======================
	
	Bookshelf '95 Setup does not automatically remove Bookshelf '94 from
	your computer. To remove Bookshelf '94, re-run Setup for Bookshelf '94
	and choose "Remove All." (This removes only the Bookshelf-specific
	files. Shared files, such as DLL's and DRV's, installed in the Windows
	System directory are not removed.)
	
	You may also need to do the following:
	
	-  If you have moved the Bookshelf '94 and/or QuickShelf icon into a
	  different Program Group since installing the application, Setup
	  will not be able to detect the new location of the icon and delete
	  it from Program Manager. After running Remove All from Setup,
	  delete the icon(s) from Program Manager.
	
	- The BOOKS94 directory (or whatever directory was identified as the
	  destination directory during setup) will not be removed. If this
	  directory is not being used for other files, use File Manager or
	  the Explorer to delete the directory.
	
	GENERAL USAGE NOTES
	===================
	
	- When copying 256-color images, be aware that unless you copy to a
	  program that can handle 256 colors, such images will appear in
	  16 colors.
	
	- Pictures copied from Bookshelf using the Copy to Word command will
	  include the caption, but pictures copied using the Copy Picture
	  command will not.
	
	- The Pronunciation Key pop up included in the Bookshelf Dictionary
	  can be copied to the Clipboard by pressing CTRL+C.
	
	- Under Windows 95, it is important to not remove the Bookshelf '95
	  disc immediately after inserting it. Please wait for the Microsoft
	  Bookshelf '95 box to appear and choose Cancel. Once the box has
	  closed, it is safe to remove the disc.

	Creative Labs Sound Blaster 16/16ASP
	------------------------------------
	
	Compressed audio clips may fail to play if you are using a Sound
	Blaster 16 or Sound Blaster 16 ASP sound card. For example, you may
	not be able to play any sounds in the Dictionary, but animations in
	the Encyclopedia may play correctly. This problem occurs because some
	computers are unable to use the 16-bit DMA (direct memory access)
	channel on the Sound Blaster cards.
	
	To correct this problem, switch the HDMA channel to use DMA or 8-bit
	DMA. You must change this setting in the following two places:
	
	1. The Drivers dialog box in the Windows Control Panel.
	
	2. The SBCONFIG.EXE configuration program included with the Sound
	  Blaster cards.
	
	To change the settings, follow these steps:
	
	1. Choose the Drivers icon in the Windows Control Panel.
	
	2. Select the Sound Blaster 16 Wave/Midi driver and choose Setup.
	
	3. Under the HDMA setting, set the selection to DMA.
	
	4. Choose OK. Choose Do Not Restart Now.
	
	5. Exit Windows.
	
	6. At the MS-DOS prompt, switch to the SB16 directory and run
	  SBCONFIG.EXE.
	
	7. Follow the instructions provided by this configuration program.
	  It assists you in selecting and testing the following variables:
	
	  Variable            Select
	  ========           ========
	
	  Base I/O port      Autoscan
	  MidiPort address   Autoscan
	  DMA interrupt      Current
	  8-bit DMA          Current
	  16-bit DMA         Use 8-bit DMA
	
	  After you have finished making these selections, the SBCONFIG
	  program will restart your computer.
	
	8. Restart Windows.
	
	Compressed audio should now play correctly.
	
	For more information about Sound Blaster cards and about this problem,
	contact Creative Labs technical support at (405) 742-6622.
	
	Sound Blaster is manufactured by Creative Technology Ltd., a vendor
	independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or otherwise,
	regarding this product's performance or reliability.
	
	Media Vision Pro Audio Spectrum
	-------------------------------
	
	Audio clips may sound "scratchy" (that is, distorted) when played from

	Turtle Beach Monte Carlo
	------------------------
	
	When using the Turtle Beach Monte Carlo sound card, sounds may play
	correctly the first time then fail on subsequent attempts. To correct
	this problem, run the Monte Carlo driver utility and change the setup
	to use the Standard drivers and not the V-synth driver. Audio clips
	should now play correctly.

	Aztech Labs (AZI)
	-----------------
	
	You may experience problems playing compressed wave audio when using
	any of the following Aztech Labs (AZI) sound cards:
	
	- Multimedia Pro
	- NX Pro 16
	- Sound Galaxy Basic 16
	- Sound Galaxy Pro 16
	
	To resolve the problem try the following:
	
	1. Add a D=64 parameter at the end of the Device=EMM386 line in the
	  CONFIG.SYS file. For example, if your EMM386.EXE file is in the DOS
	  directory on drive C, you would use the following line:
	
	     Device=C:\DOS\EMM386.EXE D=64.
	
	2. Change the DMABufferSize setting in the [386enh] section of the
	  SYSTEM.INI file to "DMABufferSize=064" (without the quotation
	  marks). If the line does not exist, add it.
	
	3. Do the following:
	
	  a) Note the driver listed in the Wave= line in the [drivers]
	     section of the SYSTEM.INI file.
	
	  b) Find the section by that name in the SYSTEM.INI file.
	     For example, if Wave=mm16.drv, find the [mm16.drv] section.
	
	  c) Add a "SingleModeDMA=True" line (without the quotation marks)
	     to this section.
	
	  d) If the driver in the Control Panel for the particular AZI
	     card has separate 8-bit and 16-bit DMA settings, try setting
	     the 16-bit to None.
	
	Some 16-bit AZI sound card drivers do not have separate 8-bit and 16-
	bit DMA settings. If the problem still persists, you may need a sound
	driver update. For more information, contact Aztech Labs technical
	support at (800) 886-8879 or Sound Galaxy Support at (510) 623-8988.
	
	The Aztech products discussed here are manufactured by Aztech, a
	vendor independent of Microsoft; we make no warranty, implied or
	otherwise, regarding these products' performance or reliability.

	BOOKSHELF '95 DISPLAY
	=====================
	
	Requirements
	------------
	
	Microsoft Bookshelf '95 requires a 256-color display to run. If your
	computer's display is less than 256 colors, you need to install a 256
	color driver, or obtain one from your video card's manufacturer.
	
	A set of generic 256 color drivers (which support most non-accelerated
	Super VGA adapters) has been included on the Microsoft Bookshelf '95
	disc (see the README.TXT supplied with the drivers for more
	information on supported video adapters). The file (SVGA.EXE) is
	located in the D:\AAMSSTP\VIDEO directory (assuming D:\ is the drive
	letter of your CD-ROM).
	
	Note: Video adapters based on the S3 chip set will not work with the
	generic 256 color driver (SVGA.EXE). In this case you will find
	specific S3 drivers (also located in the D:\AAMSSTP\VIDEO directory)
	for these video adapters. The driver you select depends on the
	specific S3 chip set your video adapter uses. For more information on
	the version of the S3 chip set your video card uses, see the user's
	manual included with your video card. Once you have determined the
	version of the S3 chip set your video card supports, use the following
	table to determine which file to copy to your hard disk.
	
	  Chip set     Copy file
	  =======      =========
	
	  801/805      S3-801.EXE
	  924          S3-924.EXE
	  928          S3-928.EXE
	
	To install the driver, you will first need to copy the appropriate
	driver file from the D:\AAMSSTP\VIDEO directory on the Microsoft
	Bookshelf '95 CD to your hard disk (Note: do not copy this file to the
	C:\WINDOWS or C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM directories).
	
	Once the file has been copied to the hard disk you will need to
	"extract" the video driver by either typing the name of the file and
	pressing the Enter key from the MS-DOS prompt (i.e., SVGA <Enter>) or
	by double-clicking on the file (SVGA.EXE) in the File Manager.
	
	Once the files are extracted, complete the installation of the video
	driver by opening the DISPLAY.TXT file located in the directory where
	the expanded video driver resides. Find the section entitled
	"Installing a Display Driver" and follow the steps.
	
	For further information on installing a different display driver,
	choose Contents from the Help menu in the Windows Setup application or
	consult your Windows documentation.
	
	Display Problems
	----------------
	
	In some situations, Bookshelf '95 may encounter video display problems
	when using high-resolution video drivers from various video card
	manufacturers. The problems include:
	
	- Images and illustrations appearing grainy or having "glitches."
	
	- Videos displaying garbled images or causing General Protection
	  Faults.
	
	Most problems can be fixed by obtaining new drivers from your video
	card manufacturer. Contact the manufacturer of your video card to
	determine if there are newer versions available. Their phone number
	should be in the manuals that came with your video card or personal
	computer. Another option for obtaining updated drivers is the
	Microsoft Download Service, an electronic bulletin board that can be
	accessed via a modem at (206) 936-MSDL (6735).
	
	Font Display Problems
	---------------------
	
	Bookshelf '95 uses TrueType fonts for its display. If you receive  a
	message stating that one of the fonts is unavailable, make sure that
	TrueType fonts are enabled on your computer.
	
	1. From the Windows Control Panel, select Fonts and then click
	  the TrueType button.
	
	2. In the TrueType dialog box, make sure the Enable TrueType Fonts
	  check box is selected (an X appears in the check box when it is
	  selected).
	
	3. If the Enable TrueType Fonts check box is selected, then go back
	  to the Fonts dialog box and click the Help button for more
	  information on adding fonts.
	
	To view fonts currently installed in Windows, open the Control Panel.
	>From the Control Panel, select Fonts. Fonts currently in use by
	Windows are listed in the Installed fonts box.
	
	Bookshelf '95 uses and installs the following TrueType fonts:
	
	- Arial (TrueType)
	- Arial Bold (TrueType)
	- Arial Bold Italic (TrueType)
	- Arial Italic (TrueType)
	- Bookshelf Symbol 1 (TrueType)
	- Bookshelf Symbol 2 (TrueType)
	- Bookshelf Symbol 3 (TrueType)
	- Symbol (TrueType)
	
	If any of the above are missing, run the Bookshelf '95 Setup program
	and choose Remove All. Once Setup is complete re-run the Bookshelf '95
	Setup program to reinstall Bookshelf '95.
	
	INTEGRATION WITH MICROSOFT WORD AND MICROSOFT EXCEL

	If Word for Windows 6.0 is installed on your computer at the time you
	install Bookshelf '95, the Bookshelf-Word integration should occur
	automatically. If for some reason the automatic integration fails, you
	can integrate the two applications manually.
	
	The following directions assume your hard disk drive is drive C; that
	Bookshelf '95 is installed in C:\BOOKS95; that Windows is installed in
	C:\WINDOWS; that Word for Windows 6.0 is installed in C:\WINWORD; and
	that your CD-ROM drive is drive X.

	NOTES ON QUICKSHELF IN WINDOWS 3.1 and WINDOWS FOR WORKGROUPS
	=============================================================
	
	QuickShelf Keys and MS-DOS Use
	------------------------------
	
	QuickShelf keys allow you to look up selected text in Bookshelf from
	any Windows application. However, you cannot bring up Bookshelf using
	QuickShelf keys from an MS-DOS application or from the MS-DOS prompt.
	Additionally, selected text in an MS-DOS application will not be used
	to perform a QuickShelf lookup when using the QuickShelf buttons.
	Other Windows applications that do not copy text in the standard way
	also may not work with QuickShelf.
	
	QuickShelf and the Clipboard
	------------------------------
	
	Clicking a QuickShelf button or using a QuickShelf key combination
	replaces the contents of the Clipboard.
	
	Moving the QuickShelf Toolbar
	------------------------------
	
	Open the QuickShelf Customize menu by either right-clicking on the
	Toolbar or by left-clicking the down arrow button at the right end of
	the Toolbar, and then clicking Customize.  Click the Customize View
	Tab, and then select either Regular buttons or Large buttons, and
	click OK. QuickShelf now has a title bar you can click in and then
	drag to a new location.
	
	QuickShelf and the Automatic Spelling Feature
	---------------------------------------------
	
	Searches performed with QuickShelf are not spell checked. In this
	case, keep Bookshelf open on your desktop as an icon; this way you
	will have quick access to it.
	
	QuickShelf and Bookshelf '94
	----------------------------
	
	If you choose to keep Bookshelf '94 installed on your computer, you
	may find that trying to launch Bookshelf '95 from QuickShelf will
	result in Bookshelf '94 being started. To correct the problem, close
	Bookshelf '94 and launch Bookshelf '95 from the Program Manager. The
	next time QuickShelf is used, Bookshelf '95 will start.
	
	NOTES ON ADDRESS BUILDER
	========================
	
	In some instances the Address Builder may be unable to suggest a ZIP
	code based on a street address alone. In this case, try using a city
	name (spell it correctly) and/or a state name to narrow down ZIP code
	information.
	
	NOTES ON THE SPELLING FEATURE
	=============================
	
	- The Automatic Spelling feature is unable to check multiple words.
	
	-  The Automatic Spelling feature functions in three places in
	  Bookshelf: the Contents Tab, Find Tab, and Advanced Find dialog.
	  When the Spelling dialog box comes up from the Contents Tab, it
	  uses a custom dictionary that has only Table of Contents items.
	  When the Spelling dialog box comes up from either the Find Tab or
	  Advanced Find dialog, it uses the standard spelling dictionary.
	
	RUNNING ON MICROSOFT WINDOWS NT

	QuickShelf Find on Windows NT 3.5
	---------------------------------
	
	When your machine is running Windows NT 3.5, you can experience
	problems when you select a word in 32-bit applications and use
	QuickShelf to perform a full-text search on the word in Bookshelf.
	Bookshelf will appear, but the search will not be performed because
	QuickShelf cannot move the text out of the application running in NT.
	
	Keep Bookshelf open on your desktop as an icon, so you have easy
	access to it from other applications when you want to do a full-text
	search on a word.
	
	QuickShelf Keys and Windows NT 3.5
	----------------------------------
	
	When your machine is running Windows NT 3.5, you can experience
	problems when you use QuickShelf key combinations in 32-bit
	applications because QuickShelf cannot move text out of these NT
	applications.
	
	In this case, keep Bookshelf open on your desktop as an icon; this way
	you will have quick access to it.
