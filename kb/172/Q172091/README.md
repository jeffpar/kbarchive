	2 Setup Issues
	==============
	The Setup program's default settings will load the Mastering Internet
	Development title to your C: drive in the MID folder. You can assign
	application files to a different drive; however, Setup will copy as much as
	8.5 MB of system files to your WINDOWS\SYSTEM subdirectory.
	
	Because Mastering Internet Development installs system files that may be
	shared with other applications, you must shut down other applications,
	including Microsoft Office, before running Setup. If you have closed all
	other open applications and you encounter problems during Setup, make sure
	your system meets the minimum requirements necessary to install Mastering
	Internet Development.
	
	Setup will not complete properly if you remove the Mastering Internet
	Development CD-ROM during Setup, or attempt to start the application before
	Setup is complete.
	
	Internet Explorer 3.0 Beta 2
	To help you get onto the World Wide Web quickly, Mastering Internet
	Development includes the Beta 2 version of Internet Explorer 3.0. You
	should install the most recent version of Internet Explorer as soon as
	possible. Internet Explorer is available to download from the Internet
	Explorer page on the Microsoft Web site, http://www.microsoft.com/ie.
	
	System Requirements
	Mastering Internet Development will run on the following minimal system;
	however, performance will improve with more RAM or a faster CD-ROM drive.
	
	- Personal computer with a 486DX or higher processor, running Windows 95
	- 8 MB of memory (16 MB or more recommended)
	- 10 MB of available hard-disk space (40 MB to work with lab files on
	 your hard drive)
	- MPC2-compatible CD-ROM drive
	- Super VGA or higher-resolution video adapter capable of displaying 256
	 colors or greater
	- Microsoft Mouse or compatible pointing device
	- MPC2-compatible audio board
	
	3 Operating System Issues
	=========================
	Microsoft Windows NT 3.51
	Mastering Internet Development runs under Microsoft Windows 95. It will not
	run under Windows NT version 3.51. The reason for this is that Mastering
	Internet Development is dependent on Microsoft Internet Explorer version
	3.0 beta or later, which does not run under Windows NT version 3.51.
	
	Several lab exercises included in this title, however, require you to run
	Windows NT 3.51 or later, in order to run Microsoft Internet Information
	Server. If you want to complete lab exercises that require Windows NT, and
	want to have Mastering Internet Development running simultaneously, we
	recommend the you have two PCs; one functioning as a client machine, the
	other functioning as a server:
	
	Client PC
	- Windows 95
	- Internet Explorer 3.0 beta or later
	- Mastering Internet Development
	
	Server PC
	- Windows NT 3.51 or later
	- Microsoft Internet Information Server 1.0 or later
	
	Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 beta or later
	When we released Mastering Internet Development,  Microsoft Windows NT
	version 4.0 was in beta.  Because the beta status of Windows NT 4.0 at the
	time Mastering Internet Development released, we do not offer product
	support for users attempting to run Mastering Internet Development under
	Windows NT 4.0.
	
	If you want to run Mastering Internet Development on a PC running Windows
	NT 4.0 beta or later, we recommend you do so on a test machine, that does
	not contain any work-critical data or applications.  We will not offer
	product support to users running Mastering Internet Development under
	Windows NT 4.0 beta or later.
	
	4 Removing Mastering Internet Development
	=========================================
	To remove Mastering Internet Development from your computer, run Setup
	again and choose Remove All. You can also uninstall Mastering Internet
	Development by running the Add/Remove Programs application in the Control
	Panel.
	
	You may also need to do the following:
	- Delete the Mastering Internet Development shortcut. If you moved the
	 shortcut to a different folder after installing the application, Setup
	 will not be able to detect the new shortcut location or delete it.
	 After running Setup (with Remove All), go to Windows Explorer and
	 delete the shortcut(s).
	- Delete the MID directory. The MID directory (or the directory you
	 specified as the destination directory during Setup) will not be
	 removed because it may contain files that you modified. If you did a
	 Complete installation, two subdirectories were added: "Lists" and
	 "Labs." If you worked on any of the labs or added topics to the
	 Notebook, that information is saved in those subdirectories. If you
	 still want to remove these directories,  you can delete them by going
	 to Windows Explorer, selecting the directory, and pressing DELETE.
	
	Warning
	When running Setup with the Uninstall option you may receive a dialog box
	with a warning about deleting a shared file. This dialog only occurs when
	Setup prepares to remove a file that another application may use. If you
	remove the file, be aware that other unregistered applications that use
	that same file may no longer run correctly.
	
	5 Using the Title's Internet Features
	=====================================
	Mastering Internet Development includes the following Internet features:
	
	Launching URLs
	This product contains Universal Resource Locators (URLs) that allow you to
	jump to information on the Internet. URL addresses change over time as Web
	sites and pages are added, deleted, modified, and moved. To keep the
	Mastering Internet Development title current, a URL jump table has been
	implemented in the title. Whenever you click on an URL jump in the title,
	the table resolves this request to an Internet URL, then launches Internet
	Explorer to locate that resource.
	
	Product Update
	The Product Update feature allows you to modify the title's URL jump table.
	If a URL link fails, or you suspect it has changed, use the Product Update
	command from the File menu to update this table from the Internet. Please
	note that after you use this command, you may need to restart the Mastering
	Internet Development title to see any changes in the content. If you have
	questions about using the Product Update feature, consult the Help file.
	
	Product Web Site
	Use the Product Web Site command from the Help menu to jump to the
	Mastering Internet Development Web page. This page will contain any future
	errata information, and pointers to additional information.
	
	6 Potential Problems Running this Title
	=======================================
	This section describes problems you may experience when running Mastering
	Internet Development.
	
	- Beta Software: Some of the material in this course is based on
	 pre-released versions of Microsoft Internet tools and operating
	 systems. There may be discrepancies between information referenced in
	 the course and the released versions of these products.
	
	- Lab 4, Exercises 1 and 2: The Spin32 and MaskedEdit controls may not
	 self-register properly when downloaded by Internet Explorer Beta. This
	 will cause them to work incorrectly. If you have Microsoft Visual Basic
	 or Microsoft Visual C++, installing these products on the Client
	 computer will correctly register the controls.
	
	- Chapter 5, "Setting and Returning Properties Sample" sample code: The
	 Slider control may not self-register properly when downloaded by
	 Internet Explorer Beta. This will cause it to work incorrectly. If you
	 have Microsoft Visual Basic or Microsoft Visual C++, installing these
	 products on the Client computer will correctly register the control.
	
	- Lab 5, Optional Exercise: This exercise may not work correctly, due to
	 problems with the HTML Select control in the Beta version of Internet
	 Explorer.
	
	- Lab 9, Lab Solution: This lab requires installation of Microsoft
	 Exchange in order to install the OLE Messaging library. If you do not
	 have Microsoft Exchange installed on your machine, you will receive the
	 VB error "Can't find project or library" when trying to send e-mail
	 using the lab solution application.
	
	- User Profiles: If you change User Profiles in Windows 95 after
	 installing this course, you should continue to log onto your machine
	 with the same username you used when installing the course. Different
	 users who have altered the default User Profiles settings may
	 experience a path error dialog when restarting the course. Using the
	 original username will avoid this problem.
	
	- Library Articles: Library articles included in this title are not
	 edited by the Mastering Internet Development team. You may encounter
	 documentation errors, references to page numbers or files, and
	 formatting problems. Addresses, phone numbers, and other contact
	 information appearing in this title may have changed since the time of
	 publication.
	
	- Topic Titles: Some of the topic titles in the application will be cut
	 off when running Mastering Internet Development in lower display
	 resolutions.
	
	- Palette Flash:  Palette flashes can occur when switching between
	 Mastering Internet Development and other running applications, and when
	 starting or stopping animations and demos.
	
	- Graphics: This title is designed to run on machines capable of
	 displaying 256 colors or more. Though the title does run on systems
	 displaying 16 colors, there is a noticeable drop in image quality. Some
	 large graphics may display out of the window when running the title at
	 640 x 480 resolution. It is recommended that you run this application
	 in 800 x 600 mode or greater. The graphic viewer in this application
	 allows you to toggle graphics between large and small views. By
	 clicking on the viewer, you can change the size of the graphic. The
	 viewer will remain the size that you last viewed a graphic. If an image
	 appears distorted or compressed, click in the graphic viewer to make
	 sure you are viewing the entire image. Note that some small graphics do
	 not change size.
	
	- Navigation and Topic areas:  If using keyboard keys to navigate through
	 the Table of Contents or the Topic area, you may need to manually
	 change the focus of the application, depending on the content you want
	 to affect. You can change the focus by clicking on the area you want to
	 navigate. On some systems, the vertical scroll bar may change size when
	 scrolling through topics and labs, or navigating through the Table of
	 Contents.
	
	- Printing: The media represented by icons in the text area (graphics,
	 sample code, tips, and answers) will not print when printing the
	 current screen. To print this information, choose Print when the media
	 is displayed in the active window. If you experience problems printing
	 over a network, consult your network administrator to make sure your
	 printer settings are correct. Solutions for common printing problems
	 are described in Section 8 of this README file, "Printing Problems." If
	 you choose to print the Glossary, the entire Glossary will be printed.
	
	- Text: Mastering Internet Development uses your system settings to
	 display some foreground and background colors. You may want to choose a
	 compatible display combination (such as the Windows Standard color
	 scheme) for best visual results. When displaying glossary popups within
	 the text, the application will sometimes lose focus. To remedy this,
	 click in the Topic area; focus will return to the application.
	
	- Video: .AVI files will only run if you've installed the Multimedia
	 options when setting up Windows 95. Setup will look for multimedia
	 options on your system and notify you if they are not installed. If
	 this is the case, you will need to install the appropriate options.
	 Even with appropriate hardware, you may experience long wait times
	 while video files are being loaded, and you may encounter errors in
	 audio/video synchronization during playback.
	
	7 Performance Issues
	====================
	There are several ways to make Mastering Internet Development run faster.
	Many of the methods described below are general tips that will improve the
	performance of any application under Windows. Consult your Windows manual
	for more details.
	
	Mastering Internet Development uses your computer's random access memory
	(RAM) to display pictures and play video and audio. If Mastering Internet
	Development runs slowly or if you get error messages saying you are out of
	memory, you may not have enough RAM available. Here are some tips to make
	the best use of your available memory:
	
	- Close all applications that you are not using.
	
	- Add more RAM (memory) to your computer. You can determine how much
	 memory is available by starting MS-DOS, typing mem and pressing ENTER.
	 This starts a program that will tell you how much memory you have. You
	 need at least 8 MB of RAM, and 16 MB is recommended.
	
	- If you are using more than 256 colors in your video display, you may
	 want to lower your video colors to 256. For instructions on how to
	 change your Windows display, consult your Windows documentation.
	
	For more details on improving performance, consult your Windows 95 and CD-
	ROM manuals.
	
	8 Hardware Problems
	===================
	In rare situations, Mastering Internet Development may encounter display
	problems when using accelerated video drivers, video drivers with more than
	256 colors, or high-resolution video drivers. One example of these problems
	is a video display with garbled images. Another is a crash occurring when
	trying to play a video. There are several things you can do if you
	encounter such problems:
	
	1. Most problems can be fixed by obtaining new drivers from your video card
	manufacturer. Contact the manufacturer of your video card to determine if
	newer versions are available. The manufacturer's phone number should be in
	the manuals that came with your video card or personal computer. Another
	option for obtaining updated drivers is the Microsoft Download service
	(MSDL), an electronic bulletin board that can be accessed by modem at (425)
	936-MSDL (425-936-6735).
	
	Drivers provided on MSDL are compressed with the PKWare utilities and are
	in the form of executable files (.EXE extension). It is best to download
	the file or files you need into an empty directory on your hard disk or a
	blank formatted floppy. To decompress these drivers after downloading them,
	either:
	
	a. From Windows 95 Explorer, double-click on the filename that you
	downloaded.
	
	-or-
	
	b. From the DOS prompt, change to the directory containing the downloaded
	file, type the filename, and then press ENTER.
	
	2. An alternative to obtaining a new or updated display driver is to change
	your video mode to a standard video mode, such as 640 x 480 resolution with
	256 colors.
	
	To find out what video driver you are using, open Display from Control
	Panel. In Windows 95, click on the Settings tab. Then click the Change
	Display Type button. Your display type will be listed there. For
	instructions on how to install or change drivers, click the Help button.
	
	9 Printing Problems
	===================
	Screen resolution and printer resolution are often not the same, so the
	resulting printout may not match the quality you see on the screen.
	
	If you encounter a general protection fault when you print a topic, check
	your printer driver. Switch to a more current version of the driver, if one
	is available. Additionally, ensure that the printer is online and that you
	can print to it from another application. If the problem persists, click on
	the Property page for the Printer you are using. Choose the Fonts tab and
	click on the method of downloading TrueType fonts that works best with your
	system.
	
	If you are using an HP LaserJet printer, make sure that you have the most
	current printer driver, or try setting the printer resolution to 300 dpi
	(graphics may not print properly at 600 dpi).
	
	You should be able to print grayscale images from Mastering Internet
	Development. If you have a black and white laser printer, you may need to
	upgrade your printer driver. Call the dealer from whom you bought the
	printer or call the printer manufacturer.
