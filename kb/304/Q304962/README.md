	The information in this article applies to:
	
	- Microsoft Train Simulator, version 1.0 
	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	SUMMARY
	=======
	
	This article describes how to optimize game performance in Microsoft Train
	Simulator.
	
	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	To optimize performance in Train Simulator, find a balance between the number of
	sound and display features you enable and the frame rate you can maintain. The
	frame rate is the speed at which images or frames are drawn on the screen. It is
	often measured in frames per second (fps). The appearance of realistic motion
	improves as the frame rate increases. To check the frame rate, press SHIFT+Z
	while operating your train.
	
	Performance in Train Simulator depends on both the features that you select and
	the configuration of your computer. A set of features that you select on one
	computer may not result in the same level of performance as an identical set of
	features on a different computer.
	
	A computer that has a fast Pentium processor, sufficient memory, a
	three-dimensional (3-D) video accelerator card, and the latest device drivers
	can maintain a higher level of performance than a computer that barely meets the
	minimum system requirements.
	
	To optimize performance in Train Simulator, optimize your hardware configuration,
	configure Train Simulator for the best performance, and then monitor the frame
	rate when you select your preferred features and settings.
	
	To optimize performance, use any of the following methods.
	
	Check Hard Disk Space
	---------------------
	
	Train Simulator may use part of your hard disk to temporarily hold information
	that does not fit in memory. Make sure you have at least 100 megabytes (MB) of
	free space on your hard disk when you run the simulator.
	
	To determine how much hard disk space is avaliable, follow these steps:
	
	1. On the Desktop, double-click My Computer.
	
	2. Click the disk drive you want to check.
	
	3. On the File menu, click Properties.
	
	4. Note the amount of available free disk space.
	
	Quit Unnecessary Programs
	-------------------------
	
	To increase the amount of available system resources, quit all unnecessary
	programs that are running on your computer before you start Train Simulator. To
	do this, use the appropriate method for your version of Microsoft Windows.
	
	Microsoft Windows 95, Microsoft Windows 98, or Microsoft Windows Me::
	
	1. Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE.
	
	2. In the Close Program dialog box, click any program except Explorer or Systray
	  (which are components of Microsoft Windows), and then click End Task.
	
	  If you receive a message stating that the program is busy or not responding,
	  click End Task again.
	
	3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 to quit all unnecessary programs that are running on
	  your computer.
	
	Microsoft Windows 2000:
	
	1. Press CTRL+SHIFT+ESC.
	
	2. On the Applications tab, click any program, and then click End Task.
	
	  Repeat this step to quit all unnecessary programs that are running on your
	  computer.
	
	3. Quit Windows Task Manager.
	
	NOTE: Some programs start automatically every time you restart your computer. For
	information about how to disable these programs, see the printed or online
	documentation for the program.
	
	Reduce Graphics Quality Settings in the Game
	--------------------------------------------
	
	To lower the resolution and disable graphic features in the game, follow these
	steps:
	
	1. On the Train Simulator startup screen, click Options.
	
	2. Click Display.
	
	3. In the Display Resolution box, click 640 X 480 x 16.
	
	4. Move the Overall Display Quality slider all the way to the left to Best
	  Performance.
	
	5. Click the Save arrow.
	
	Reduce Sound Quality Settings in the Game
	-----------------------------------------
	
	1. On the Train Simulator startup screen, click Options.
	
	2. Click Sound.
	
	3. Move the Quantity of Sounds slider all the way to the left to Low.
	
	4. Click the Save arrow.
	
	Use the Microsoft Train Simulator Troubleshooter
	------------------------------------------------
	
	When you install the game, the Train Simulator Troubleshooter is installed. You
	can use the Train Simulator Troubleshooter to customize the startup process to
	help resolve certain problems that you may encounter when you attempt to start
	or play the game.
	
	To use the Train Simulator Troubleshooter, follow these steps:
	
	1. Click Start, point to Programs, point to Microsoft Games, point to Train
	  Simulator, and then click Train Simulator Troubleshooter.
	
	2. Click Troubleshooting.
	
	3. Click to select all of the check boxes.
	
	4. Click OK.
	
	5. Click Play Train Simulator.

	Enable Features or Increase Settings in the Program
	---------------------------------------------------
	
	To finish optimizing performance in Train Simulator, use the methods described
	earlier in this article to enable features or increase settings one at a time.
	Enable more features by starting with your favorite features, and stopping
	before the minimum frame rate decreases to a level that you consider
	unacceptable. To display the frame rate, press and hold down SHIFT as you press
	Z twice.
	
	Install the Latest Version of Microsoft DirectX
	-----------------------------------------------
	
	Download and install the latest version of DirectX from the following Microsoft
	Web site:
	
	  http://www.microsoft.com/directx/homeuser/downloads/default.asp
	  (http://www.microsoft.com/directx/homeuser/downloads/default.asp)
	
	For additional information about how to obtain and install the latest version of
	DirectX, click the article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base:

	Update Your Video Driver and Sound Card
	---------------------------------------
	
	Contact the manufacturer of your video adapter and sound card to inquire about
	how to obtain and install the latest drivers for your video driver adapter and
	your sound card. For information about how to contact your video manufacturer,
	click the appropriate article number below to view the article in the Microsoft
	Knowledge Base:

	  Q60781 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, L-P
	
	  Q60782 Hardware and Software Third-Party Vendor Contact List, Q-Z
	
	To identify the manufacturer and model of your video adapter, follow these
	steps:
	
	1. On the Windows Start menu, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.
	
	2. Double-click System.
	
	3. If you have a Windows 95- or Windows 98-based computer, click the Device
	  Manager tab.
	
	  If you are using a Windows 2000-based computer, click the Hardware tab, and
	  then click Device Manager.
	
	4. Expand (click the PLUS SIGN next to) the Display adapters folder.
	
	5. Under the Display adapters folder, note the manufacturer and model of your
	  video adapter, and then click OK.
	
	6. Close all open windows.
	
	Improve your Hardware by Adding Better Hardware
	-----------------------------------------------
	
	- Add more Random Access Memory (RAM)
	  RAM is your computer's short-term memory. A computer writes data to the hard
	  disk temporarily if RAM is full. This can slow down processing time. The more
	  RAM you have, the faster your computer can process data.
	
	- Upgrade your graphics card
	  Graphics cards with 3-D technology are advancing at a tremendous rate. Newer
	  graphics cards operate faster and have more on-board RAM than older graphics
	  cards. This can improve graphics performance remarkably.
	
	- Get a faster processor
	  A computer with a faster central processing unit (CPU) generally gives you
	  better performance.
	
	- Experiment
	  The best way to make Train Simulator run the way you want it to is to
	  experiment. Change something, then check the performance and readjust if
	  necessary. A good way to compare performance levels with different settings
	  is to check the frame rate--the speed, displayed in frames per second
	  (FPS)--at which your screen is being updated.
