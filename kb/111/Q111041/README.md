	System version 2.0 Windows drivers.
	
	For more information about using WSSCONFIG.EXE and WSSXLAT.EXE, and running
	MS-DOS applications using the Windows Sound System board, see the "Using Sound
	Blaster-Compatible MS-DOS-Based Games and Applications" section on pages 71-82
	of the "Microsoft Windows Sound System User's Guide."
