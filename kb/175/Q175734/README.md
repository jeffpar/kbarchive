	MORE INFORMATION
	================
	
	1. Q. What is Microsoft Chat 2.0?
	
	  A. Microsoft Chat 2.0 is the only Internet chat program that gives you the
	  option of conversing inside a comic strip. When you use a standard chat
	  program, you enter a chat room on an Internet server and conduct real-time
	  conversations with other people. However, when you use Chat 2.0, you may also
	  pick a cartoon character to represent you. Your conversation appears as word
	  balloons inside the frames of a comic strip. As a cartoon character, you may
	  express a wide range of emotions, send "thoughts," whisper to a selected
	  recipient, and save the chat session for off-line viewing.
	
	  The Chat 2.0 window is composed of the following parts:
	   - A viewing pane where the conversation is displayed.
	
	   - A member list pane that lists all the members in a chat room.
	
	   - A compose pane (a text box at the bottom of the window) where you type
	     your messages.
	
	   - Buttons you may click to send messages.
	
	  When you use the Comic Chat option of Chat 2.0, you see the following:
	   - A "starring" pane that displays the title of the chat and lists the
	     participants.
	
	   - A self-view pane that shows what your character looks like.
	
	   - An emotion wheel that enables you to control all of your character's
	     emotions.
	
	2. Q. What are the differences between Comic Chat 1.x and Chat 2.0?
	
	  A. Although Comic Chat 1.x and Chat 2.0 are very similar, Chat 2.0 has some
	  significant enhancements and features, including:
	   - Better support for text chat.
	
	   - Customizable fonts in both text and comic (voice balloon) areas.
	
	   - A toolbar with one-click access to tools and resources, as well as easy
	     execution of common tasks.
	
	   - A user list that allows you to search for users in all rooms on a chat
	     server.
	
	   - Macros that let you have a favorite reply instantly ready.
	
	   - Sounds that you can send to embellish your conversation, from small noises
	     to music.
	
	   - Enhanced whisper capabilities that let you whisper to people in other
	     rooms.
	
	     To determine if you are using Comic Chat 1.x or Chat 2.0, look at the top
	     of the window that appears while you are running the chat. Either Comic
	     Chat or Microsoft Chat is displayed on the title bar.

	     alphabetical list of programs to see whether Comic Chat or Microsoft Chat
	     is listed.
