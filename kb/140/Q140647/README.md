	The Microsoft File Transfer files included in this package were placed in the
	C:\VVSetup directory.
	
	WHEN YOU NEED THESE FILES

	following Microsoft File Transfer files cannot be found:
	
	    FileXfer.exe
	    FileXfer.hlp
	    FileXfer.cnt
	    Fte.dll
	    Wsvv.vxd
	    VVExe32.exe
	
	follow the instructions under the Installation section of this document.
	
	Microsoft File Transfer is not Installed:
	
	Microsoft File Transfer (filexfer.exe) may not always be installed when a
	VoiceView capable modem is installed. If Microsoft File Transfer is not
	installed, you may be able to configure your modem as a generic VoiceView modem
	so that you can use File Transfer.
	
	If Microsoft File Transfer is not installed on your computer, first consult your
	modem documentation or contact your hardware vendor to make sure that your modem
	is VoiceView capable. Then, install File Transfer by following the steps under
	Configuring Your Modem as a Generic VoiceView modem.
	
	INSTALLATION

	Installing Your VoiceView Modem:
	
	Install your modem through the Control Panel, Modems applet. If you need
	additional assistance with installing your modem under Windows 95, search on the
	word "modem" in Windows 95 help.
	
	When files are being copied, a VoiceView modem will require the File Transfer
	files. When you are prompted for a path to these "missing" files, type in
	"C:\VVSetup". The files will be found, and the installation will finish.
